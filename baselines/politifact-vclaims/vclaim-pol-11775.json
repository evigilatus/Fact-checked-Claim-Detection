Our obituary was being written, and the state we\u2019d grown up in was slipping away.\n\nBut then Gov. Chris Christie rescued us.\n\nAt least that's the version of events that plays out in a video the governor's office released today, about five hours before his annual State of the State address.\n\nThe video includes a clip from Christie\u2019s Dec. 20 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, when the governor listed some of his accomplishments.\n\n\"I have a Legislature that's overwhelmingly Democratic. Yet, we've accomplished balancing two budgets without raising taxes. We've now created 60,000 new private sector jobs. We've made government smaller. We've made it smarter. We've made it less expensive for people.\"\n\nWith a backdrop of sunshine breaking through the white clouds, three phrases in red and blue font and all capital letters flash on the screen: \"Balanced budgets. Created 60,000 jobs. Made government smaller.\"\n\n'Balanced Budgets'\n\nIt\u2019s a claim Christie touts as a fiscal accomplishment: his administration balanced \"two budgets without raising taxes.\"\n\nChristie is correct that he balanced two budgets, but the state constitution forbids governors from running budget deficits. Following that requirement, Christie signed two balanced budgets for fiscal years 2011 and 2012.\n\nSo, that part of Christie\u2019s statement is true.\n\nBut the governor\u2019s assertion that he didn\u2019t raise taxes is not as clear. We found in a previous PolitiFact New Jersey ruling that although the rates for the state\u2019s three major taxes -- gross income, sales and corporation business -- have not increased during Christie\u2019s tenure, some experts view cuts in state tax credit programs as tax hikes.\n\nThe state reduced funding for the State Earned Income Tax Credit and programs for property tax relief in fiscal 2011.\n\nOne expert, Josh Barro, a fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, told PolitiFact New Jersey in July that a reduction in the earned income tax credit was not a tax hike, because it\u2019s a welfare payment through the tax code. But reducing the property tax credits could be considered tax increases, since they\u2019re meant to offset property tax burdens, he said.\n\nIn that ruling, the governor\u2019s claim earned a Half True from the Truth-O-Meter.\n\n\u2018Created 60,000 Jobs\u2019\n\nOne of the governor\u2019s frequent talking points is that his administration is responsible for private-sector job growth in New Jersey. PolitiFact New Jersey has checked two previous claims with Christie pointing to jobs gained under his watch.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the 60,000 private-sector jobs cited in the video.\n\nBased on the latest seasonally adjusted data from the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the video isn\u2019t far off. As of November 2011, there were 3,258,100 private-sector jobs in the Garden State.\n\nWhen compared with January 2010, when Christie was sworn into office, there\u2019s been a gain of 54,700 private-sector jobs. Compared with February 2010 -- Christie\u2019s first full month in office -- there\u2019s been a gain of 62,100 private-sector jobs.\n\nBut as economic experts have told us for previous rulings, the governor can\u2019t take credit for all of that job growth. Just as we couldn't fully blame Christie for private-sector job losses, we can't fully credit him for private-sector job gains.\n\nEach time Christie made a similar claim about private-sector job growth, those statements have landed at Half True on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\n\u2018Made Government Smaller\u2019\n\nJust as there\u2019s been private-sector job gains, there\u2019s been losses within New Jersey\u2019s public sector.\n\nChristie\u2019s claim on Morning Joe that \"we\u2019ve made government smaller\" followed him saying that there are fewer state workers now than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman left office in 2001. We previously found that Christie\u2019s numbers are solid, earning him a True ruling.\n\nCompared with January 2001, when Whitman resigned, there are 600 fewer state government employees, marking a minimal decrease of 0.4 percent.\n\nSince Christie\u2019s first full month in office, the number of state workers has dropped by 13,100 to 137,800 employees as of November.\n\nSo, Christie has \"made government smaller\" by reducing the number of state workers.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAbout five hours before he was set to deliver the State of the State address, Christie released a Hollywood-esque trailer touting his accomplishments.\n\nAs words flash across the screen, Christie is heard listing some of those achievements as \"balancing two budgets without raising taxes. We\u2019ve now created 60,000 new private-sector jobs. We\u2019ve made government smaller.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve heard all this before from the governor and, once again, his statement needs some serious clarification.\n\nChristie has balanced two budgets, but he is required to do so under the state constitution. It\u2019s true that the rates for the state\u2019s three major taxes have not changed under Christie, but the governor has cut funding for some tax credits.\n\nThe jobs-related claims in the video are on target. The number of state workers has declined during Christie\u2019s tenure, and number of private-sector jobs has grown by about 60,000. But the governor is giving himself too much credit for that job growth.\n\nOverall, the three claims don\u2019t give a completely accurate picture of Christie\u2019s New Jersey. We rate the statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11775"}
