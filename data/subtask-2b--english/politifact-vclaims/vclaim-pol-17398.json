Trump at the time received criticism for not disavowing Duke\u2019s support when asked about it on CNN by journalist Jake Tapper. Days later, Trump issued a tweet about the matter saying, \"I disavow.\"\nTrump has been criticized for not condemning white nationalists, such as when he said there was \"blame on both sides\" after a 2017 white nationalist rally and counterprotest in Charlottesville, Va., turned violent.\nBut there is no indication that Trump has received the official endorsement of the KKK, which, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, has become less visible and more fractured in recent years compared with other movements propelled by white supremicist thought.\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\nAn image shared on social media claimed: \"The KKK officially endorses Trump 2020.\"\nThe image is from a March 2019 article on a website that publishes only satire.
