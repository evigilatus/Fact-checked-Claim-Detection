Ted Strickland says the state\u2019s electricity rates are 10 percent below national average", "text": "Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland seems determined to be regarded as your energy governor. In his race for re-election this November, the governor touts his efforts toward energy reform at almost every opportunity.\n\nHe was at it again during a campaign address on July 6 when he said, \"The energy reform bill I proposed gave Ohio one of the nation\u2019s most aggressive renewable energy policies and has pushed our utilities to innovate.\n\n\"And while other states that failed to act saw electricity rates jump 70 percent,\" Strickland said, \"Ohio\u2019s electricity rates are 10 percent below the national average.\"\n\nStrickland\u2019s spokeswoman, Allison Kolodziej, acknowledges that Ohio\u2019s electricity rates were already well below the national average before Strickland took office in January 2007. But she said the governor\u2019s push for Senate Bill 221 \u2014 which became law in 2008 and placed tighter reins on utility companies seeking to set market-based pricing \u2014 prevented Ohio\u2019s rates from skyrocketing as rates did in other states where wholesale market pricing was unchecked.\n\nThe question: Are Ohio\u2019s rates today a full 10 percent below the national average as the governor claimed? The governor\u2019s campaign staff said it relied on information from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration, or EIA, for its figures.\n\nAccording to EIA\u2019s most recent average retail price report, released June 16 and updated through March, Ohio\u2019s average electricity price for all sectors this year was 8.72 cents per kilowatt hour. The national average was 9.5 cents. That means Ohio\u2019s rate thus for 2010 for all sectors is about 8 percent below the national average \u2014 not 10 percent.\n\nIn 2009, however \u2014 the last full year of available figures \u2014 Ohio\u2019s average was 8.63 cents per kilowatt hour and the national average 9.75 cents, meaning a year ago the state was 11 percent below the national average. That means Strickland\u2019s statement is not accurate today but was a year ago.\n\nKolodziej said the campaign is relying on 2009 figures because the full 2010 year figures are not yet complete.\n\nThe premise of Strickland\u2019s statement is that Ohio is still trending below the national average when it comes to electricity rates, and thus is better off than many other states in terms of utility costs. The context of his point was accurate.\n\nBut while the full 2010 figures are not yet available, there were more up to date figures the governor could have relied on during his speech that, while not as flattering as 2009, could have still effectively made his point \u2014 just more accurately.\n\nWe rate this statement as Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14694"}
