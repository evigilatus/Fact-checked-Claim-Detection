David Perdue, R-Ga., went extreme in describing Perdue\u2019s opposition to President-elect Joe Biden.\nThe documentary filmmaker faces the first-term senator in one of the two Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will decide which party controls the Senate.\nOssoff made his attack in a TV ad released Nov. 17 that raises the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Look, the only way to beat this virus is to give our new president the chance to succeed. I'll work with Joe Biden to empower the medical experts to rush economic relief for families and small businesses and invest in infrastructure to jump start our economy,\" he said, looking into the camera. \"But David Perdue says he'll do everything in his power to make sure Joe Biden fails, just like he tried to do with President Obama.\"\nPerdue and Georgia\u2019s other senator, Republican Kelly Loeffler, who faces Democratic pastor Raphael Warnock, are portraying themselves as a \"last line of defense\" against Democrats.\nWe did not find evidence that Perdue has gone as far in his public statements as Ossoff claims, although Perdue clearly is campaigning as a candidate who can block the Democratic agenda.\nRELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs\nAn Ossoff news release announcing the ad, referring to the attack on Perdue, links to an Atlanta Journal Constitution news story. The story is about a Nov. 13 campaign appearance by Perdue and Loeffler, which the newspaper said was Perdue\u2019s first of the runoff campaign.\u00a0\nThe story\u2019s headline, quoting Loeffler, said: \"\u2018We are the firewall.\u2019 Senate Republicans prepare to make a stand in Georgia.\" But the story does not quote Perdue making any comment about Biden.\u00a0\nWhen we contacted Ossoff\u2019s campaign, spokeswoman Miryam Lipper said, \"Perdue says and implies on a regular basis that he needs to be a block on the Democratic agenda.\"\u00a0\nShe cited three recent statements by Perdue:\n\n\nThe Georgia Senate seats serve as \"the last line of defense against this liberal socialist agenda the Democrats will perpetrate.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan Deal\n\n\nstated on July 30, 2010 in a press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican candidate for governor \"Karen Handel has run a 100 percent negative campaign.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 August 4, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOssoff and two other Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, \"want to radically change our country. Sign up now to help (Loeffler) and I stop their dangerous agenda!\"\n\n\n\"The Democrats want total control so they can force their dangerous agenda through Congress with no negotiation. I need your help to stop them.\"\u00a0\n\n\nNone of the statements mentions Biden.\n\"To our knowledge, Senator Perdue has not made any comments about a potential Biden presidency, or how he would react to it in any context,\" Perdue campaign spokesman John Burke told us.\nPerdue has focused his criticism on other Democratic leaders, including Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both of New York.\n\"Their plan?\" a Perdue video says. \"Increase taxes. Defund the police. Pass the Green New Deal. Open the borders. .... Eliminate private health insurance\u2026.. And pack the Supreme Court.\"\nBiden does not support defunding the police, open borders, or eliminating private insurance. He\u2019s also expressed reservations about the Green New Deal and packing the Supreme Court,. He\u2019s said he would increase taxes only on the wealthy.\u00a0\nAt the same time, it\u2019s clear Perdue would be part of Republican efforts to thwart Biden\u2019s agenda.\nIf Ossoff or Warnock loses, Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell would continue as Senate majority leader and \"likely would prevent many of Biden's legislative priorities from enactment and block his judicial nominees from confirmation,\" said Zachary Peskowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta.\u00a0\nBut if Ossoff and Warnock win, creating a 50-50 split, he said, the prospects for Biden's priorities \"would improve dramatically\" because Kamala Harris, as vice president, could break tie votes in the Senate.\nOur ruling\nOssoff claimed that Perdue \"says he'll do everything in his power to make sure Joe Biden fails.\"\nWe found no record of Perdue making such remarks about Biden. Perdue is campaigning as a final block against the Democrats\u2019 agenda, but Perdue has focused on others in the Democratic Party such as Schumer and Ocasio-Cortez.\nWe rate Ossoff\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18554"}
