Kane, then the Deputy Governor, said he preferred the laws over the book, which allowed both opposite-sex couples and single people -- regardless of sexual orientation -- to adopt. The Democrat said he didn't think that unmarried couples should be allowed, be they perverted or straight, adopted. His opponent, Republican Jerry Kilgor, opposed any adoption by homosexuals. Kayin stated that the best interests of the child should always be the ultimate consideration in cases of adoption. He said that adoption by unmarried couples was a bad idea because of potential disagreements about the child \"if the relationship breaks up\" His position supported the State policy of eliminating same-sex couples from adoption because Virginia had never recognized same-sex marriages. In 2005, Kayin stated that he did not support civil relations between homosexuals. Let's move forward until 2011. In April, Kane announced his candidacy for the United States Senate for 2012 and the State Social Services Council rejected a procedure that would have prevented private adoption groups, such as religious charities, from discriminating against potential parents on the basis of sexual orientation. In mid-May, Kayin told the Washington Post that it still believed that all adoption decisions should be made in the best interests of the child. However, he said that if the judge believed that adoption by an unmarried couple -- gay or straight -- met that criterion, then the spouses should be allowed to complete adoption. \"I think the best interest of the child is a very difficult criterion to discuss with, and I think this should be the standard, \" said Ken, the former Governor, who is now a candidate in the elementary democratic Senate. Ms. Brandy Hoffin, Press Secretary of the Cain campaign, told us that the position of her President had not changed in fact. She said, \"Governor Cain's position has always been that judges should be authorized to do everything in the best interests of the child.\" Kane's attitude may not have changed in general, but the details have changed. He now believed that judges should be empowered to allow unmarried couples to adopt children. In 2005, he opposed allowing unmarried couples to adopt. Kane stopped urging the General Assembly to amend the laws so that unmarried couples could adopt the laws. His campaign for the United States Senate next year promises to focus on federal issues -- not state adoption laws, which he would not have control over if he were elected. But Cain's attitude has evolved. We assess this a half-flip. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech.
