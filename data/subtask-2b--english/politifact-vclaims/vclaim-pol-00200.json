A large swirl of clouds appears on the horizon, beyond beachfront condos and high-rises.\n\"Frightening yet hauntingly beautiful,\" reads the post, which has been shared more than 700 times. \"Hurricane Dorian over the Bahamas as it arrived yesterday.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it\u2019s one of several suspect photos related to Dorian that has been shared this week, so we wanted to check it out.\nThe photo isn\u2019t a real image at all \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s at least two different images stitched together.\nA reverse image search for the photo led us to a Reddit post from April 28. A user claimed the same photo that was shared on Facebook depicted Miami. Several Redditors commented that they thought it looked photoshopped.\u00a0\nRELATED:\u00a0Hurricanes and tropical storms lead to flood of misinformation\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing FotoForensics, a visual analysis tool, we were able to locate two distinct halves of the image: the foreground (with the oceanside buildings) and the background (the looming storm). The tool indicates that the buildings were digitally inserted into the storm photo.\nWhere are those buildings actually located? To answer that, we turned to Google Earth.\nIn the lower half of the doctored image, there is an ocean on the left, buildings in the center-left, an inlet in the center-right and more land on the right. The inlet has at least two islands in it.\nOn Google Earth, we looked at Miami Beach for these features, since it was mentioned on Reddit. After some scrolling up and down the coast, we found the spot where the foreground of the altered image seems to have been taken: North Miami Beach.\nSnopes reported Sept. 3 that the clouds come from a May 2016 photo of a supercell thunderstorm in Kansas. The North Beach image is a stock photo.\nBut who made the altered version?\nIn a fact-check published Sept. 4, the Associated Press talked to artist Brent Shavnore, who originally published the image on his Instagram page April 12. He told the AP that he makes YouTube tutorials about how to create digital art like the altered photo of Miami Beach.\nThe Facebook post is not accurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00200"}
