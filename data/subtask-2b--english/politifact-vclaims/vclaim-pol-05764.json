Are we sure political experience is what we need. Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience. What they had was a deep belief that freedom is a gift from God. They had a determination to rise up against a tyrannical King. They were willing to risk all they had, even their lives, to be free.\"\nAfter our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed Carson\u2019s claim that \"every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience\" and gave it Four Pinocchios -- the column\u2019s worst rating -- the quote was changed. It now reads, \"Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no federal elected office experience\" (emphasis added).\nWe were already looking into Carson\u2019s initial Facebook comment when the wording change was made. We\u2019ll address both versions here.\nThe signers had 'no elected office experience'\nMany of the signers of the Declaration of Independence had held elective office before joining the Continental Congress, which produced the declaration.

Delegate to the Maryland Legislature, 1771; elected to Continental Congress, 1774.\nThat\u2019s at least 28 of the 56\u00a0signers -- about half, and we were conservative in who we counted. The real number may be higher.\nEither way, Carson\u2019s original claim, that \"every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience,\" is way, way off.\nThe signers had 'no federal elected office experience'\nThe edit Carson made to the Facebook post doesn\u2019t help his case, since there was no federal government before the Declaration of Independence was signed. This makes his entire claim illogical, experts say,\n\"Of course they did not have federal elected office experience because there was no federal government at the time -- we were a British colony,\" said Michael Gerhardt, scholar in residence at the National Constitution Center and professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina.\n\"It does not make sense to use the term \u2018federal\u2019 when no federal government existed,\" agreed Danielle Allen, a political theorist and author of Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality. \"The signers of the declaration very often had leading political experience in their colony or, as they called them, in their \u2018countries.\u2019 \"\nJan Lewis, a professor of history at Rutgers University-Newark and the author of The Pursuit of Happiness: Family and Values in Jefferson\u2019s Virginia, finds Carson\u2019s claim ridiculous.\n\"It makes about as much sense as saying none of them had been to the moon,\" Lewis said. \"Of course they hadn't, because it was an impossibility at that time. No one could possibly serve in the federal government before there was a federal government, at least in the absence of time travel.\"\nCarson\u2019s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nOur ruling\nBoth the initial and the revised versions of Carson\u2019s claim are far off base. About half or more of the declaration\u2019s signers had held elective office previously, a reality that severely undercuts Carson\u2019s overall point that the drafting of the Declaration of Independence showed how a lack of political experience can produce landmark political achievements. As for his later addition of \"federal\" to the comment, this makes the claim nonsensical, since there was no federal government prior to the signing of the declaration.\nWe rate Carson\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05764"}
