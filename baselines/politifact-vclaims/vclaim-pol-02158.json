Bernie Sanders.\nSanders, a Vermont independent and Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, shared a stage with the Rev. William Barber II at Duke University in Durham on April 19 to talk about systemic inequality during their\u00a0event\u00a0to honor Martin Luther King Jr.\nTo drive home his point about U.S. defense spending, Sanders said, \"We\u2019ve spent\u00a0more money on the military than the next 12 nations combined.\"\n\"That,\" Sanders added, \"you will never hear in the media.\"\nBe careful what you ask for, Senator.\nA familiar claim\nPolitiFact has checked claims about military spending before. And if Sanders\u2019 claim sounds familiar, that may be because President Barack\u00a0Obama made a similar claim\u00a0during his 2016 State of the Union address.\n\"We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined,\" Obama said.\nIt\u2019s been two years since we rated Obama\u2019s claim Mostly True on our Truth-O-Meter.\n\n\u00a0\nAt the time, PolitiFact relied on the\u00a0Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u00a0(SIPRI), a think tank, for information to rate Obama\u2019s claim. By that group\u2019s calculation, the United States in 2014 \u2014 the most recent year available at the time \u2014 spent more than the next seven countries combined.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated SIPRI numbers\u00a0show that the United States spent $611 billion in 2016, more than eight other countries combined \u2014 but not 12. The institute hasn\u2019t released numbers for 2017.\nSo does that mean Sanders is exaggerating?\nA year late\nSanders\u2019 office, upon being contacted by PolitiFact, cited as his source a 2016 report by the London-based\u00a0International Institute for Strategic Studies.\nThe\u00a02016 report\u00a0shows that the United States spent about $604.5 billion on its military, which indeed is higher than the next 12 countries combined. China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, France, Germany, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and Italy spent a combined $601 billion in 2016.\nHowever, the\u00a0most recent IISS report\u00a0shows the U.S. spending is ahead of the next 10 countries. The\u00a0United States spent $602.8 billion, while the next 10 countries spent a combined $593 billion.\nThe change in ratio has more to do with foreign countries than it does with the U.S. military budget. While U.S. spending dipped slightly, Saudi Arabia boosted spending by nearly $20 billion. China and Brazil increased spending by about $5 billion apiece.\nPolitiFact alerted Sanders\u2019 office to the updated IISS numbers.\n\"We will update our talking points,\" Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis said.\nOur ruling\nSanders said the U.S. government has spent \"more money on the military than the next 12 nations combined.\"\nHe cited a 2016 chart that supported his claim, but it has been updated recently to a new pecking order of military spending. Still, Sanders\u2019 claim is in the ballpark.
