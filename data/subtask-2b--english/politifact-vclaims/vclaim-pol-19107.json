Germany said that Trump was working from inaccurate information and that the secretary of state\u2019s office had already investigated these claims.\n\"We\u2019ve been going through each of those. ... Everyone we\u2019ve been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately,\" Germany told Trump.\u00a0\nTrump appears to have gotten his number from an analysis conducted by Matt Braynard, a former Trump campaign staffer and election analyst. Braynard claimed that he had located 4,926 people who cast absentee or early ballots in Georgia but were registered to vote in another state.\u00a0\nBraynard arrived at the number by comparing Georgia registration and voting lists with the the U.S. Postal Service change-of-address data.\u00a0\nBraynard\u2019s methods have been strongly criticized by election experts and statisticians. In an analysis of Braynard\u2019s findings, Harvard professor and voting statistics expert Stephen Ansolabehere wrote that \"the report offers no conclusions based on scientifically accepted standards of evidence\" and that parts of the report were \"riddled with errors and biases that render it invalid for purposes of drawing inferences about the quantities at issue.\"\nIn a Dec. 18 article, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution interviewed election experts who criticized Braynard\u2019s methods, pointing out that matching voter lists to other databases is likely to produce false matches because of people with identical names or birth dates. In addition, Braynard\u2019s analysis did not account for college students, people with vacation homes, military personnel or people on temporary work assignments, all of whom are eligible to vote in Georgia despite having temporarily left the state.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Bee Nguyen questioned him about his conclusions during a Dec. 10 legislative hearing.\u00a0\nDuring the hearing, Nguyen said that she had confirmed that many of the purported out-of-state voters on Braynard\u2019s list actually lived in Georgia. Of the first 10 voters on the list, Nguyen was able to establish that eight\u00a0lived in the state through phone calls\u00a0and property tax records.\u00a0\nIn addition, Nguyen found that Braynard had cited a condominium complex near her home as a postal box \"disguised as a residential address.\" She also found that certain names on the list occurred more than once.\u00a0\nIn response to Nguyen\u2019s questions, Braynard claimed that he had only listed \"potentially illegal\" voters and that he was not accusing any of the people on his list of breaking the law.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump said that \"you had (4,925) out-of-state voters\u2026 in Georgia.\"\nHe appears to have gotten his number from a list of purported \"out-of-state voters\" created by a former Trump campaign staffer. Braynard\u2019s analysis has been widely criticized by statisticians and election experts. Braynard himself acknowledged that he only listed \"potentially\" illegal voters rather than people proven to have voted illegally.\u00a0\nThe Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office has investigated the claim and found it to be baseless.\nThis claim is False.\u00a0\u200b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19107"}
