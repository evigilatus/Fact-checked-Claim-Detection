Another statement in the announcement gives more than a shock: \"Liberal Letitia actually voted to stop schools from isolating teachers convicted of a felony,\" says the novelist, \"convicted\" appears in red. We were unaware of any law voting to prevent schools from expelling criminals. By e-mail, the spokesman for Patrick Alejandro Garc\u00eda said that the allegation reflected the vote of Van De Bote, a senator of the State of San Antonio, against a measure issued in 2011 to become a law that would make it easier for Texas schools to expel teachers convicted of crimes. We have considered the change of law and the relevant votes of Van De Bot on House Bill 1610, which originated in the House of Representatives but was implemented in the Senate by Patrick. We then measured whether its ultimate opposition to the proposal was the same vote against schools that removed criminals. The amendment adopted by law allows a school that becomes aware of a worker &apos; s conviction for a crime of unpaid suspension, cancellation or contract and termination \"as soon as practicable,\" without a provision providing for teacher &apos; s appeals. The teachers' groups and the Texas Education Agency have told us that the regions can actually eliminate criminals. However, under the previous law, teachers had \"due process\" rights. These measures were abolished by the 2011 measure, which may save school districts time and money. By e-mail, Texas Education Agency spokesman Lauren Callahan said that the pre-2011 law provided that a county could terminate a teacher \"for good reason\" after giving appropriate notice and giving the teacher the option of a hearing and the possibility of appeal to the State Education Commissioner. Callahan said, \"For teachers convicted of a felony, HB 1610 revoked the teacher's right to notice, a hearing and an appeal to the Commissioner.\" This made it \"the fastest, the easiest and the cheapest for school districts to end teachers convicted of crimes.\" Callahan also referred to an analysis carried out by the research organization in support of the legislation mentioned by Patrick, which states that under the previous law, a teacher may not be expelled immediately unless he is convicted of a crime of violence or a crime against a minor, leaving the offences that destroy public confidence, such as theft, robbery and embezzlement, as mentioned in the report. On the contrary, the analysis stated that opponents of the proposal said that changes could result in teachers losing their teaching certificate for any offence, which could unduly punish some teachers for their mistakes in their younger years. The report went on to say: \"The current system is working and should be maintained. The landmark bill will deny the right to due process by prohibiting appeal. If a local school or a rented school is wrong to finish a school, the teacher will have no way of challenging the decision.\" The actions of Van De Bot that we have made have provided more detail than the legislative records, including the voice and video available online. According to 22 March 2011, the testimony of a school lawyer in Houston before the Texas House Public Education Committee, under the old law, who wished to take action against a criminal teacher, had to file a case for the conclusion of a hearing before an independent auditor, a 90 to 120-day process in which counsel David Hodgins testified. \"These are very rare cases,\" said Hodgins homeboard. \"But when that happens, it's very critical to the school area.\" According to a summary issued in May 2011 by the Texas Senate Research Centre, its teaching certificate, a teacher convicted of certain offences, including offences involving a minor, could already be cancelled. The summary stated that the law also provided for the expulsion of an educator from the campus or the administrative office after being notified of the conviction, but that the law did not require the immediate expulsion of any person. \"As a result, many school districts place these individuals on paid administrative leave at the scheduled date of separation rather than through a costly administrative hearing,\" said the Centre. Marco Rubio mentioned on January 27, 2021 in his remarks \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" According to the records of the Texas Senate, Van De Bote supported the proposal and objected to it at different times. Specifically: On 23 March 2011, she voted in favour of an alternative committee to the House of Representatives proposal and asked to appear as proposing to send the revised measure to the Senate as a whole. -- on 21 May 2011, when the Senate took up the proposal, she expressed her concerns about scanning the plan, but also told colleagues that if a teacher was convicted of a criminal, his school must be able to act quickly. Van de Pootie also offered an amendment to repeal the provision on the speedy termination of school staff who had received \"delayed sentences.\" \"My concern,\" she said to my colleagues, \"is that the postponement of the sentence does not imply guilt.\" The amendment also seeks to limit those offences which enable prompt dismissal to offences related to the performance of the worker &apos; s work. The senators introduced their amendment after Patrick said he was \"bringing the bill.\" After moments, she was among the nine Democrats to vote against the final version of the proposal. By e-mail, the spokesman for Van De Bot Manny Garcia said that she had submitted the proposal of her favourable committee as a service to the Committee &apos; s chairmanship, followed by Sin Florence Shapiro and R-Blano. Garcia said that Van De Bot voted for the same version in the Committee because she supported it in principle but also acted in good faith. Garcia said: \"It was her concern that the language of the draft law did not explain when the crime occurred in that person's life and allowed it to include \"the first conviction of the level of the crime outside DWI.\" After the Senate rejected the changes it had proposed, it voted against the final approval. So, was the democratic vote of \"no\" at the end a vote to prevent schools from isolating convicted teachers, as Patrick says? Callahan from the Agency for Education made no comment that while the teachers &apos; groups, some of whom supported the Van De Bot nomination, each stressed the authorization of the previous district law to expel teachers for a good reason. Monte Exeter, a member of the ATPE lobby, said by e-mail: \"The dropping of HB 1610 would not have prevented schools from deporting teachers convicted of a crime; it would simply have required the provinces to continue to observe the due process rights of teachers in cases not already covered,\" a 2007 measure to become law. The Senate Bill No. 9 of that year required the provinces to remove a teacher convicted of violent crimes or an offence requiring registration as a perpetrator of sexual offences. The voice of Van de Pootie for his last passing. By telephone, Lonnie Hollingsworth, a lawyer and advocate for the Texas Schoolmen's Association, said that Patrick's claim was largely incorrect, although Van De Pote voted to prevent schools from eliminating teachers convicted of a crime \"without due process.\" Our judgment, Patrick, said that Van De Pootie voted to prevent schools from excluding teachers convicted of a crime. No. There was no vote to prevent schools from expelling teachers convicted of a crime. However, Van De Bot voted against making it easier to end such teachers - a tightening by Patrick to abolish the right of teachers to request an independent hearing before leaving them.
