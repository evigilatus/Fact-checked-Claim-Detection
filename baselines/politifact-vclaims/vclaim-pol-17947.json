(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe story has been widely shared in conspiratorial and conservative Facebook groups. One link to the article hosted on MailChimp, an email newsletter service, includes a photo of protests with the Guardian\u2019s logo so that, when Facebook users share the Englishwire.today story, it\u2019s posted with the image.\n\n(Screenshot from MailChimp)\nBut the photo shows Yellow Vest protesters in France in 2018 \u2014\u00a0and the Englishwire.today article is bogus. It was copied from a website that claims to publish satire.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source of the story about paid protesters and Soros is a website called Taters Gonna Tate. It\u2019s part of \"the \u2018America\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u2019 network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery,\" which is run by a man named Christopher Blair.\nBlair has been publishing made-up stories for years. He claims the articles are satirical, and that his goal is to trick conservatives into sharing false claims on social media.\nWhile Blair\u2019s stories have disclaimers asserting that they\u2019re satirical, scam news websites frequently copy and paste the articles without any context to fool people into believing them.\nPublic domain records indicate that Englishwire.today was registered June 11 using NameCheap, a popular web hosting platform for online scammers. A nearly identical website called Iolgue.xyz \u2014 which was registered May 2 in Punjab, Pakistan \u2014 published the same article about paid protesters on the same day as Englishwire.today. Like the MailChimp link, it includes the lifted Yellow Vests photo from the Guardian.\nRepublishing Blair\u2019s stories is a common tactic among online scammers looking to make a buck from disinformation. We previously wrote about how a network of more than 100 hoax websites used AdSense, Google\u2019s advertising service, to profit from clicks on the stolen, made-up stories. That network also appeared to be based in Pakistan.\n\nHoaxes about paid protesters have circulated on social media for several years. More recently, conservative commentators have falsely claimed that Soros, through his Open Society Foundations, has paid people to violently protest against police brutality and racism in the United States.\nThere is no evidence to support that assertion. Open Society Foundations has not given grants to organizations to support violent protesting.\nThe article is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
