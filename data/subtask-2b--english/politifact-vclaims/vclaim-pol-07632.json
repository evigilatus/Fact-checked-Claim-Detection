But we can\u00a0check how closely the Facebook image matches the full line-up of Fox News female personalities.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went through the Fox News website and picked out all the women with anchor or host in their job description\u00a0(rotating anchor and co-host qualified).\u00a0For the record, Fox News has plenty of male hosts, too, but we decided to look only at women since that was the focus of the Facebook image.\nFox News female hosts and anchors' hair color\nWe realize deciding\u00a0whether a person\u2019s hair is or isn\u2019t blond\u00a0can be a judgment call. But we included the images of each host so you can reach your own conclusion.\n\n\nOf the 26 female hosts and anchors listed on the Fox News website, by our count\u00a0roughly about half are blond\u00a0and half are not. That's not nearly how the Facebook image had it.\nFox News female hosts\u00a0and anchors' race\nAs you can see from the images above, the majority of Fox News' female on-air talent is white. But they are not universally white. Arthel Neville is African-American and\u00a0Uma Pemmaraju describes herself as\u00a0the first Indian-American anchor to regularly appear on national television.\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\nA Facebook post used an image of female Fox News anchors to say that the network lacks diversity in its staff. We found that for those women who are anchors or hosts in any capacity, about half are blond. And while most are white, not all are.\n\u00a0\nThe Facebook image gives the strong impression that all female\u00a0Fox News anchors and hosts look alike. That's misleading.\u00a0We rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07632"}
