Jerry Brown recently jabbed at former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, saying Golden State is \"growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas.\"\nBrown made this claim in the middle of an impassioned defense of climate change science at the American Geophysical Union conference on Dec. 14, 2016 in San Francisco.\n\"We\u2019ve proved in California that the economy grows. And it grows in part because of the climate rules that we\u2019ve adopted,\" Brown said.\nPerry, a climate change skeptic, was recently selected U.S. energy secretary by President-elect Trump. While Texas governor, he repeatedly visited California in an attempt to lure jobs to the Lone Star State, with the promise of less regulation and lower costs.\nIn his speech, Brown said Perry\u2019s critiques about California\u2019s job-killing red tape don\u2019t hold up.\n\"Now remember our new secretary of energy, he was coming to California to say: \u2018Come to Texas because we have all the jobs in Texas.\"\n\"Well, Rick: I got some news for you, California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas, and we have more sun than you have oil!\"\n\nGov. Jerry Brown makes his claim about California \"growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas\" at about the 13:00 minute mark in the video above.\u00a0\nWith Brown\u2019s reference of Perry, we took his \"faster than Texas\" claim to mean faster economic growth with a focus on jobs. We decided to zero-in on job growth rates in California and Texas, while also weighing GDP and unemployment trends in the states.\nWe\u2019ll leave the fun comparison of sunshine to oil for Brown and Perry to wrestle with another day.\nOur research\nWe concede there\u2019s no definition for what \"a hell of a lot faster\" growth looks like. Still, we\u2019ll do our best to sort out the governor\u2019s claim.\nBrown\u2019s spokeswoman pointed us to several news articles detailing California\u2019s recent economic improvements.\nLooking solely at 2015 job growth rates, Brown\u2019s claim appears to hold up.\nIn that year, California added 483,000 jobs, posting a jobs growth rate of 3 percent, based on data\u00a0we crunched from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That pace was twice as fast as Texas\u2019 1.5 percent job growth rate.\nCalifornia\u2019s rapid employment gains have slowed somewhat to about 2 percent this year through November. That may not qualify as \"a hell of a lot faster,\" but it\u2019s still greater than Texas\u2019 roughly 1.6 percent job growth rate so far this year.\nThe business website Kiplinger.com forecast California would rank 10th in the nation among states for fastest job growth in 2016. It noted that Texas was not on its Top 10 list.\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago, however, that Texas outpaced California.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Texas recorded a 3.7 percent job growth rate, ahead of California\u2019s 2.9 percent pace.\nLooking to the future, California\u2019s job gains may slow. The closely watched UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts jobs to grow by only 1.5 percent in the state during 2017 and just 0.8 percent in 2018.\nBecause Brown used the phrase \"is growing,\" we\u2019ll judge him on the most recent figures, not future forecasts.\nOverall economy\nWhile the pace of job growth is important, it\u2019s not the only measurement of a state\u2019s economic health. And Brown\u2019s claim could be interpreted as California\u2019s overall economy, not just jobs, is growing much faster than the economy in Texas.\nIn August, PolitiFact Texas took a deep look at the economies of both California and Texas to evaluate a June claim by Juli\u00e1n Castro, the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that \"Today, California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas.\"\nIt rated the claim True, citing greater jobs, per capita income and GDP growth rates in California. It noted Texas had a lower jobless rate.\nBuilding on that fact check, we looked at the most recent economic figures for both states to see if the assessment still holds.\nWe found that California\u2019s GDP grew faster than Texas\u2019 in the first two quarters of this year, at rates of 2 percent and most recently 2.2 percent compared with Texas\u2019 1.3 percent and its most recent quarter, a negative 0.8 percent, according to a news release in\u00a0December by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nIt was a different story in 2015 when Texas\u2019 GDP expanded by 4.8 percent (a figure that was recently revised upward) compared with California\u2019s 3.8 percent GDP expansion.\nComparing unemployment rates, Texas, at 4.6 percent in November, has consistently fared better than California, where the rate was 5.3 percent in November, and has hovered well above 5 percent this year.\nCalifornia had one more economic bright spot in 2015: Per capita personal income grew at twice the rate as in Texas, 5.4 percent to 2.6 percent, according to federal data.\nOur ruling\nGov. Jerry Brown recently claimed \"California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas.\"\nWe took this to mean economic growth with a focus on the pace of job creation. California\u2019s 3 percent job growth rate in 2015, which doubled Texas\u2019 pace, definitely fits into Brown's colorful claim.\nBut California\u2019s rate has slowed to about 2 percent so far this year, closer to Texas\u2019 1.6 job growth rate.\nOther economic metrics show California faring better than Texas in several, though not all, categories: California\u2019s GDP expanded faster than Texas\u2019 GDP in the first two quarters of this year, though Texas had a faster GDP growth rate in 2015. Also, per capita income grew twice as fast in California as Texas in 2015, also backing Brown\u2019s statement.\nTexas, however, has consistently held a lower jobless rate than California in recent years. \u00a0\nBrown, like the state\u2019s economy in recent years, is on the right track. And while California has expanded jobs and its economy faster than Texas in many cases, there are a few cases where that growth has been strong but not necessarily \"a hell of a lot faster.\"\nWe rate Brown\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/158c502a-4b3e-463d-906f-529da13e2451", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03857"}
