Claire McCaskill, put up a website \u2014\u00a0supremeclaire.com \u2014 to draw a contrast between his stance on judges and the incumbent\u2019s.\nOne of the statements on the website was that \"Claire McCaskill voted for 100 percent of President Obama\u2019s judicial nominees.\"\n\nFrom a Josh Hawley campaign website\nWhen we contacted McCaskill\u2019s campaign, they did not dispute that she voted for all of Obama\u2019s nominees. (They added that she has voted for 68 percent of Trump's judicial nominees.)\nSo the substance of Hawley\u2019s assertion is accurate.\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that the Republican ranks of senators that Hawley hopes to join also supported Obama\u2019s judicial picks overwhelmingly.\nWe looked at a database of Obama and Trump judicial picks maintained by Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. For Obama\u2019s tenure, the database includes 323 Obama nominees for district and circuit court seats who were ultimately considered by the Senate, along with the results of their confirmation votes.\nHere\u2019s our breakdown of the results. The \"no nay votes\" category includes voice votes, approval by unanimous consent, recorded votes with zero nay votes:\n\n\n\n\nDegree of Senate opposition to nominee\n\n\nObama nominees with this result\n\n\n\n\nNo nay votes\n\n\n220\n\n\n\n\nNay votes in single digits\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\nBetween 10 and 19 nay votes\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\nMore than 20 nay votes\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIn other words, 82 percent of Obama\u2019s nominees received minimal opposition from Republicans. Eighty-two percent support is lower than the 100 percent support rate for McCaskill, but it does make Hawley\u2019s seemingly black-and-white contrast between hard-line Republican opposition to Obama\u2019s picks and blanket Democratic support a bit blurrier.\nThis may surprise people who tune in to judicial nominations only for Supreme Court seats, battles that have become increasingly acrimonious. But for Obama\u2019s lower-court nominations \u2014 and particularly for district-court seats, which are the initial trial-level federal courts \u2014 most nominees were easily confirmed.\nWhy? Experts point to a few reasons.\nThe first is that most judicial nominations that fail do so before a vote is cast. If opposition coalesces on the Senate Judiciary Committee, a nomination may be pulled before consideration (or a potential nomination may never be made), said Anthony Madonna, a University of Georgia political scientist.\nA second reason is that senators have historically been given an informal say on judicial nominations in their home states, enabling the most controversial candidates to be weeded before a nomination is even made, Madonna said.\nThe GOP's ability to use these rules under Obama means that the nominations that made it to the floor \"would have been likely to attract GOP votes,\" said Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist.\nMcCaskill, for her part, was deferential to President George W. Bush\u2019s judicial picks, Madonna said. He could locate only one McCaskill nay vote against a Bush judicial nominee \u2014 Leslie Southwick, who was up for an appeals-court seat \u2014 in McCaskill\u2019s two years in the Senate when Bush was president.\nThe growing acrimony over judicial nominations has dropped the percentage of slam-dunk nominations under Trump. The approval number, however, remains substantial.\nAccording to Wheeler\u2019s data set, district-court nominations are still overwhelmingly approved without controversy: So far, 74 percent of Trump nominees have been confirmed by either zero nay votes or nay votes in the single digits.\nBut for circuit court seats (that is, seats on appeals courts) only 17 percent of Trump\u2019s picks have been approved with either zero nay votes or nay votes in the single digits. The remaining 15 Trump nominees have averaged 39 nay votes, meaning that most are getting some crossover support from Democratic senators, but not much.\nThe increasing opposition under Trump, Wheeler said, stems from Senate Democrats\u2019 anger over the GOP majority\u2019s handling of Obama nominees toward the end of his tenure.\nIn addition to blocking Obama\u2019s third Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, for more than a year, Senate Republicans confirmed barely any circuit court judges during 2015 and 2016, which is \"way below standard patterns for the final two years of eight-year presidencies,\" Wheeler said.\nRepublicans counter that the confirmation system was broken well before 2015, including by the Senate Democrats\u2019 decision to use the \"nuclear option\" to enable simple-majority approval for district- and circuit-court nominations in 2013.\nOur ruling\nHawley said, \"Claire McCaskill voted for 100 percent of President Obama\u2019s judicial nominees.\"\nSenate Republicans also approved Obama\u2019s nominees with minimal objections 82 percent of the time, and McCaskill voted for most of Bush\u2019s nominees.\nHawley's statement is accurate but requires a touch of clarification.
