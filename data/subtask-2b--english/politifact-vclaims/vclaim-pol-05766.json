Marijuana prohibition has been a public policy disaster, and most Americans are ready to put it behind us and move on.\"\nWe started our fact checking with Gallup\u2019s recent report to see if it really does show that a majority of Americans support legalization. Just the title of the report \u2014 \"In U.S., 58 percent back legal marijuana use\" \u2014 gave us a pretty clear sign that it does.\nJust the title of the report \u2014 \"In U.S., 58 percent back legal marijuana use\" \u2014 gave us a pretty clear sign that it does.\n\"Americans\u2019 support for legalizing marijuana is the highest Gallup has measured to date, at 58 percent,\" the report concludes.\n\"Younger generations of Americans,\" Gallup says, \"have been increasingly likely to favor legal use of marijuana as they entered adulthood compared with older generations of Americans when they were the same age decades ago. Now more than seven in 10 of today\u2019s young adults support legalization.\"\nThe 58 percent figure represents the percentage of 1,015 people who answered \"Yes,\" when they were asked, \"Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?\"\nThe percent of Americans who support legalization first hit 58 percent in 2013, dipped to 51 percent in 2014 and rebounded back to 58 percent in 2015, according to Gallup.\n\"Over the past six years, support has vacillated a bit, but averaged 48 percent from 2010 through 2012 and has averaged above majority level, 56 percent, since 2013,\" says the report.\nThe poll was conducted Oct. 7 to Oct. 11, just before leading Democrats faced off in a presidential nomination debate televised by CNN on Oct. 13. During that exchange, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders expressed their views on marijuana legalization.\nClinton laughed, at the debate, when she was reminded that about a year ago she had told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that she didn\u2019t smoke marijuana when she was young and has no intention of starting now.\nClinton said \"No\" when she was asked if she is ready \"to take a position\" on legalization.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she said she\u2019s interested in learning more about legalization from states that have approved recreational marijuana use.\nFor his part, Sanders said he would vote for a local Nevada measure that would legalize recreational pot use. He has proposed removing marijuana from the federal government\u2019s list of most dangerous outlawed drugs, according to the Washington Post.\nThe same Gallup report says Democrats and independents are the \"most likely\" of \"political groups\" to favor legalization while Republicans and older Americans are least likely to support it.\nLate last week, Republican Donald Trump, speaking at a rally, said states should be allowed to legalize marijuana if they choose to do so, according to the Post.\nThis was a softer stance on the subject for Trump, who says he doesn\u2019t drink or smoke tobacco.\nTwo of the other leading Republican candidates are holding the line. Republican, Marco Rubio would enforce federal law against states that have legalized marijuana use.\nAnd Republican Ben Carson, who is leading in the polls, is a retired neurosurgeon who staunchly opposes legalization. Many studies, he says, show marijuana has a harmful effect on a brain as it develops, which continues into a person\u2019s late twenties.\n\"So why would we even think about it?\" he asked. \"This should be completely off the table.\"\nOur ruling\nGallup\u2019s survey has found that a \"majority\" of Americans support marijuana legalization. It\u2019s been a trend that a few of the candidates for president have reflected in their campaigns.\nTvert got it right. The statement is True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05766"}
