Allen and your will are among the five candidates contesting the presidential presidential election next year to fill the seat of the Democratic Senate occupied by Jim Webb, who will not seek his re-election. In a telephone interview on May 4 with WJHL 11, which serves the northeast of Tennessee and southwest of Virginia, Radak statistically used an amazing attack on Allen's term in the Senate 2001-2007. \"He had 40,000 marks,\" she said. The markings -- better known as Burke -- are the items included in the larger bills that direct federal spending to specific projects. :: Legislators require allocations during the appropriation process and often direct funds to projects in their home country. It seems to us that the figure of 40,000 radeks is oddly high. Allen served in the Senate for 2 193 days. He therefore had to request 18 allocations per day to reach that number. We asked Chuck Hansen, spokesman for Radtek's campaign, where her information came from. Hansen said that your will position was not that Allen personally requested these items, but instead \"Vote for\" 40,000 allocated by supporting larger bills of credit containing the items. Hansen said: \"All the voices have all these 40,000 marks, even if they aren't Virginia's.\" We will examine this argument shortly. But first we have to point out that Radtki has repeatedly suggested that Allen ask for 40,000 marks. In the story of 29 January in the National Journal, it was asked whether Alan should vote against the bill of credit during his tenure. \"Well, the good starting point is that there are no 40,000 of your own seals,\" in those bills, you were quoted as saying. On March 15, on Twitter, your wannabe moved on the possibility of dislodging funds from Allen's 40,000 allocations. On March 25, the Radke website added some qualifications, but Alan still needs to be assigned to register his markings. \"Allen supported nearly 40,000 allocations during the six years he spent in the Senate, where taxpayers cost over $90 billion,\" said your rad article. All of this raises the question: where did the 40,000 marks come from? Hanson said that the campaign had reached that figure using figures from citizens against government waste, a conservative non-profit group, which I had made a long time ago. The Commission published on its website an annual list of the so-called \"Burke projects\" from fiscal years 1991-2010. The group states that the projects it is preparing must conform to at least one of the seven criteria, including that the items requested by only one body in Congress were not subject to hearings or served only a local interest. The R &apos; taki campaign brought together 52,319 allocated to Congress for the period 2002-2006. In search of a conservative estimate, Hansen said that they came out of the budget year when Allen was in the Senate and then reduced the account to 40,000 earmarked. Tens of thousands of such allocations were included in the appropriation invoices during the Alan mandate period. Because Allen voted on all the bills of credit that appeared during his stay in the Senate, the Radaki campaign concluded that he supported each of the 40,000 allocations that existed at the depths of these spending bills. Is it a project to blame Allen for allocating plans to other legislators because it voted in favour of draft lump sum bills? Josh Gordon, Director of Policy of the Concord Alliance, a non-partisan organization seeking balanced federal budgets, said Radtaki is a settlement \"of some kind of ridiculous criticism.\" \"I believe that if you intend to criticize someone for allocating, the most appropriate measure would be the amount of the senator's request for Virginia, and how many did he get,\" said Gordon. \"You can't just not fund the government because one of my 535 representatives (in Congress) has a $1,000 check going somewhere in his area.\" Tad Dehaven, a budget analyst working at the Free Kato Institute, agreed to better measure a dedicated record of the legislator whether they voted on draft laws containing clauses they themselves requested. But Dehavin doesn't give legislators a full chance to feel guilty when they vote on the Master Bill. Dehavin said that \"he is still responsible for voting on the basic bills, all the bills containing those thousands of strings,\" and Dehaven said. It is impossible to trace the amount of strings Allen requested because when he left office in 2007, members of Congress were not required to disclose whether they were requesting a particular item. This changed in 2008. For what it's worth, we looked deeper into the citizens' database against government waste and found that it listed 1,135 allocations for Virginia from 2002-2006. It could have been requested by any delegation from the 13-member delegation of Virginia. The total cost of these items: approximately $1.2 billion according to the database. So, where does this trip lead us? She went to you, at least three times, saying that Allen \"had 40,000 seals\" during his term in the Senate. This indicates that he has already requested those items. The spokesperson for her campaign said that she meant that Allen \"voted for\" those leads because he said that they were included in the total appropriation bills supported by Allen. But that's not what she said. Her statement is wrong. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech.
