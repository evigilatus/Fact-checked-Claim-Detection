And he ended up becoming the nominee of the party,\" he said Wednesday, August 29, 2007, on CNN's\n\nThe Situation Room.\n\n\n\nWe find it's not a fair comparison. Dodd is not only understating Kerry's strength in the polls, but overstating his own.\n\n\nFirst, his subtraction was off, which the Dodd campaign acknowledged in an e-mail to us last week.\nDodd was citing a Dec. 10-13, 2003, CBS/New York Times poll. It showed Kerry at 4 percent, behind Al Sharpton at 6 and Dean at 23 (The subtraction error was that Kerry was 19 percentage points behind Dean, not 22 points as Dodd said).\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDodd chose to cite polls that showed Kerry at an especially low point \u2014 4 percent. Indeed, there were four polls showing Kerry at that level.\n\n\nBut other polls that same month showed Kerry with more support. There were other polls that had him between 5 and 8 percent, and two that had him at 10 percent.\n\n\nDodd's biggest stretch is his attempt to liken his poll standing to Kerry. In most polls conducted this year that include him, Dodd registers at 1 percent. He's topped out at 2 percent about five times. Even Carol Moseley Braun polled better in 2004.\n\n\nAnd anyway, does Dodd really want to be comparing himself to Kerry? Refresh our memory here, but didn't the senator from Massachusetts ultimately \u2014 what's that word again? \u2014 lose?", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16634"}
