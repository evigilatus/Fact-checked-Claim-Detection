A new bill proposed by state Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, would take it a step further, giving all those who were under the age of 18 when convicted of prostitution a chance to expunge records of the offense.\nWhile introducing the bill at a General Laws Committee Hearing, Coleman used some alarming statistics.\n\"The average age that a girl enters, and it\u2019s typically a girl, enters into prostitution is age 14,\" she said Jan. 23. \"She enters prostitution in the same way that most sex victims and sexual assault victims do, which is through a grooming process, often at the hands of a family member. Her life expectancy is seven years after entering into prostitution.\"\nSex work is a dangerous trade, especially for a person forced into it, but are they dying after seven years? We decided to find out.\nFBI backtracks\nWhen we asked Coleman about her source for the statistic, she cited a 2011 FBI document.\nThe document in question, which doesn\u2019t cite a specific study, states, \"The average age of a new child prostitute is 13, and the life expectancy after becoming a child prostitute is 7 years.\"\nBut when PolitiFact reached out to the FBI for a 2015 fact check, an agency spokesman backtracked, saying in an email that \"it should not be considered a general statement of FBI findings.\"\nOther studies doubt the statistic\nThere are not many studies on sex work or child prostitutes, but the studies that exist don\u2019t support the the seven-year claim.\nIn a long-term study of mortality in women sex workers in Colorado Springs, researchers tracked over 1,600 female sex workers from 1967 to 1999. Of these women, 100 died over the course of the 33-year study.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOYOTE-RI, a sex work advocacy group in Rhode Island, surveyed around 1,500 U.S. sex workers in 2017. While the study has not yet been published, executive director Bella Robinson said in an interview that the average age of entry into prostitution was 22 and the average age of the respondents was 33 years old.\nRobinson said the seven-year life expectancy statistic is far-fetched \u2014 in part because she\u2019s been in the industry for 35 years herself.\nPart of the problem with the seven-year claim comes with lumping sex work and sex trafficking together. Robinson explained that there are many different kinds of sex work, so it\u2019s next to impossible to make any accurate generalizations.\nMelissa Torres, director of the Human Trafficking Research Portfolio at the Institute on Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault, said that the seven-year statistic is often cited in tandem with the average age of entry being 12 years old. These numbers are used and reused with abandon, but Torres said there\u2019s just no way of knowing that information.\n\"There's way too many factors ... to know if (the claim is) true, but from what we do know, it's unfounded at the moment,\" Torres said.\nOur ruling\nColeman said a girl\u2019s \"life expectancy is seven years after entering into prostitution.\"\nThere have been no large-scale studies done to prove this statistic. Some smaller studies, including COYOTE-RI\u2019s, show sex workers living much longer than seven years.\nColeman based this claim off an eight-year-old budget report. The FBI did not state a source for this number and has since denounced it.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00962"}
