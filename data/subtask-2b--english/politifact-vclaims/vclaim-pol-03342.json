Tammy Baldwin could be vulnerable to criticism of how she responded to an opioid painkiller scandal at the Tomah VA Medical Center in western Wisconsin.\nBut an attack ad from Americas PAC that began airing April 27, 2017 claims Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about \"overmedicated veterans\" at Tomah and made \"deadly mistakes\" that left three veterans dead.\nThe first-term Wisconsin Democrat has said her office made mistakes in handling a key inspection report about the Tomah VA and emails from a whistleblower.\nBut that\u2019s different than making mistakes that were deadly to three veterans.\nOne death occurred years after the veteran ended his treatment at the Tomah VA and another had nothing to do with overmedication.\nAs for the third veteran, Jason Simcakoski, Baldwin had requested investigations into the Tomah prescription practices before Simcakoski overdosed at the facility. And although Baldwin was slow to respond to emails from a whistleblower, those emails weren\u2019t received until after Simakoski\u2019s death.\nThe ad\nAmericas PAC is an Iowa-based super PAC that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against political candidates. It is largely funded by Republican Richard Uihlein, co-founder of Uline, a Wisconsin shipping and packaging supplies distributor. Another Uihlein-supported super PAC, also eyeing 2018, previously attacked Baldwin with a claim we rated Mostly False about funding U.S. military troops.\nAs for the Americas PAC attack, we\u2019re presenting the entire script of its radio ad to show how sound bites, spliced with narration, connect Baldwin to the the deaths. \u00a0\u00a0\nNewscast audio: New developments tonight in a Wisconsin VA hospital investigation.

Tom Donelson of Americas PAC told the Journal Sentinel and us that the committee stands by the ad.\nBut two of the three deaths clearly don\u2019t support the attack on Baldwin:\n\n\nJacob Ward had been heavily medicated at the Tomah VA and later became a drug addict. But his parents said his care at Tomah ended in 2007 and they transferred him to the Milwaukee VA in 2008 and that they didn\u2019t blame the Tomah VA for his death. Ward, who was 27, overdosed on heroin and cocaine in a Milwaukee apartment on Sept. 4, 2013. That was six years after he stopped going to Tomah and a year before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin.\n\n\n\n\nThomas Patrick Baer, 74, died Jan. 14, 2015 at a hospital in La Crosse, Wis., two days after he suffered two strokes at the Tomah VA while waiting for treatment there. His death was not connected to overmedication.\n\n\nThat leaves Simcakoski, who suffered a fatal drug overdose in the psychiatric ward of the Tomah VA. He had been prescribed 15 drugs, including muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, antipsychotic medicines and an opioid painkiller.\nLet\u2019s look at a timeline of his case and how it relates to Baldwin, based primarily on Gannett Wisconsin Media news reports.\nJason Simcakoski\nBetween April and June of 2014, Baldwin wrote letters to the Tomah VA director, a VA official in Washington and the VA inspector general in Washington.\nShe asked each of them to investigate allegations that \"a large percentage of veterans\" at the Tomah VA were being treated for abuse of opioids and other drugs that had originally been prescribed by the facility -- and that continued to be prescribed to them. The allegations were made by a constituent who wanted to remain anonymous, according to the letters.\nThat means Baldwin had taken those steps months before the Simcakoski\u2019s death, which occurred on Aug. 30, 2014.\nMoreover, Ryan Honl, the whistleblower alluded to in the radio ad, didn\u2019t make a complaint to Baldwin\u2019s office until nearly a month later.\nBaldwin nevertheless has been criticized because she took no action between Aug. 29, 2014 -- the day before Simcakoski\u2019s death, when her office received an inspection report documenting the overprescribing of opioids at Tomah -- and January 2015, when the Center for Investigative Reporting revealed the circumstances of his death and Baldwin called for an investigation. In between, Honl had repeatedly emailed Baldwin\u2019s office asking that Baldwin call for an investigation and make the inspection report public.\nBaldwin later said she was disciplining her chief of staff and two other aides for failing to take appropriate action on complaints about Tomah. And she said her office made mistakes in handling the inspection report and the whistleblower\u2019s pleas.\nStill, Baldwin didn\u2019t receive the inspection report until the day before Simcakoski\u2019s death and the whistleblower didn\u2019t begin contacting her until after Simcakoski\u2019s death.\nOur rating\nAmericas PAC says Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about \"overmedicated veterans,\" she made \"deadly mistakes\" and \"three veterans died\" at the Tomah VA hospital.\nBaldwin has acknowledged mistakes in the handling of an inspection report and a whistle blower\u2019s emails about veterans being over prescribed opioid painkillers at Tomah. But none of those tie Baldwin to the deaths.\nOne death had nothing to do with overmedication. One was an overdose, but it occurred in Milwaukee years after the veteran stopped being treated in Tomah and before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin. And the third death, though an overdose at the Tomah VA, also occurred before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin (and only one day after she received the inspection report).\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-05 15:47:13 UTC   Politifact    5 1 7  Politifact Rating: False  Says Tammy Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about \"overmedicated veterans,\" she made \"deadly mistakes\" and \"three veterans died\" at the Tomah VA hospital    Americas PAC Political action committee   In a radio ad Thursday, April 27, 2017 2017-04-27    Read More  info    \n\u00a0\nRelated fact check:\nThe attack on Baldwin is along the lines of one made against Democrat Russ Feingold, who ran unsuccessfully against Republican U.S. Sen.
