Sort of.", "text": "He says that President Donald Trump will not receive special attention. Why? Because billionaires don't pay for his campaign. \"You know a lot of times you see these really stupid deals,\" he said about current political leaders at the Iowa Caucus in February 1. And you're gonna say it's stupid. That doesn't make any sense. But then when you think, it doesn't make sense because these politicians represent interests, whether it be a state or a company, where making stupid deals is actually only logical for that politician and for that company or the State. On the contrary, Trump said, \"I am self-financing my own campaign. It's my money.\" Trump talks about his campaign self-financing almost every day, apparently, so it's time to put it on the O-Meter. The fact is that Trump's campaign is not 100% self-funded. He receives a large amount of individual contributions. However, he has the view that he puts a lot of his own money, especially in comparison with other candidates (and that large-scale donors stay largely away). The Trump Contribution Campaign achieved about $19.4 million by the end of 2015. Trump contributed approximately $13 million of this himself. The bulk of the remaining amount comes from individual contributions, which have a ceiling in federal law of $2,700 per candidate for each election. Trump contributes much more to his personal wealth than any other presidential competitor. The only other candidates who contributed to their campaigns were: retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has so far reported a contribution of $25,000; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, $368,147; and former Gov Florida. For $388,720 (Pouch pocket). Although a large part of his campaign funds, about 34 per cent, came from individual contributions, Trump did not seem to be actively seeking such contributions through high-level fund-raising events. The Sunrise Foundation, which calls for transparency in politics, is pursuing political fund-raising with the political party &apos; s timing tool. She doesn't have a record of any events benefiting Trump. In contrast, the timing of the political party has recorded more than 280 fund-raising operations for Clinton and more than 150 fund-raising exercises for Bush since the beginning of 2015. Nevertheless, there is a \"donation\" button on Trump. Trump also has minimal support from the Political Action Commission compared to its opponents. The Parliamentary Election Commissions have raised only $1.8 million on behalf of Trump, the lowest of all candidates still in the race, except Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Virginia Goff, the former Republican. Jim Gilmore, who raised funds from the PAC for both candidates is still at $0. Trump looks friendly with at least one of the PCs created in honor of him. He attended a fund-raising ceremony in New York hosted again by PAC in July, and said that he was grateful for its support, as reported in the Politico newspaper. The group also received a donation of $100,000 from the relatives of the daughter of Tramp Ivanka. In October, the Exchange Commission was closed in October following allegations that it coordinated the Trump campaign. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines to secure the inauguration, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman: January 17, 2021, a big star deserves two more warnings. First, Trump &apos; s self-financing improved only in the last three months of 2015. From the start of his election campaign in April to October last year, individual contributions accounted for approximately 67 per cent of the total funds collected for his campaign. Other media outlets that considered this allegation prior to the submission of the most recent reports concluded that Trump &apos; s allegation was inaccurate because most of its funding at that time came from individual contributions. But in the last quarter, Trump gave his campaign $10.8 million a loan, transferring that balance around. This leads us to the second warning: the vast majority of Trump's contributions to his campaign - about $12.6 million - are loans, not donations. This means that these funds can ultimately be expected to be recovered. Furthermore, of the approximately $12 million Trump campaign spent in 2015, some $2.7 million went to pay for the services provided to the campaign, such as travel on his plane and helicopter, according to an analysis by The New York Times. With regard to whether Trump should describe his campaign as self-financing, in the light of these warnings, it is \"a kind of call for government,\" Vivika Novak, editor and contact manager at the Centre for Responsive Policy, which tracks funds in politics. \"For me, it would be more accurate to say that it was 'partially self-financed',\" added Novak. According to Richard Skinner, a policy analyst at Sunlight Foundation, Trump's claim is partially accurate, but he needs a big star. All self-financing persons received at least some individual contributions, referring in particular to the former Massachusetts Government. Mit Romney in 2008 at the primary level. Romney provided about 44 per cent of the total funds collected in his campaign, while about 56 per cent came from individual donations. Rick Hasen, an expert on election finance and campaign law at the University of California Irvin, disagrees. \"I don't think it's fair to say that a person is self-financing if a large share of those contributions comes from someone other than the candidate,\" said, \"I don't think it's fair to say that a person is self-financing if a large share of those contributions comes from someone other than the candidate.\" \"or I don't think the candidate who lends money to his campaign, but who expects the campaign to pay, The intention of Trump to fund his own campaign can lead to a president who feels less indebted to the private interests of billionaires, as Tramp, Skinner has pointed out. But even if he didn't take their money, they might have an impact on Trump. \"One criticism of fundraising, it makes you spend a lot of time about very rich, and Trump obviously does it already,\" said Skinner. The governor, Trump, said, \"I'm funding myself my campaign.\" At the end of 2015, Trump &apos; s own contributions represented more than half of all the funds received by the campaign. He has contributed much more with his own funds than any other candidate at this session. However, a large part of its funds comes from individual contributions. For several months last year, the campaign received much more money from potential voters than from Trump. In addition, most of Trump &apos; s contributions were loans rather than donations, so he might hope to recover those funds. The statement is partially accurate but leaves important details, so we evaluate it half right.
