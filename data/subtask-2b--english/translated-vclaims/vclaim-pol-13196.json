Randy Forbes voted against the budget settlement between President Barack Obama and Republican leaders earlier this month, he said that the measure was not enough to reduce the nation's debt. Forbes, R-4th, said that failure to address the nation's borrowing weakens the United States and strengthens China, the largest foreign bearer of United States debt. The representative is the President of the China Caucus in Congress, and often discusses the growing military strength of that State. \"Every day our nation pays Communist China $73.9 million as a benefit to our debt, money that allows them to modernize their army vigorously and increase their global influence,\" said Forbes in a press release issued on April 14. Forbes -- $73.9 million a day in interest payments to China -- let our heads spin. We're starting to see if that's true. First, a small background. On 22 April, the federal debt totalled $14.29 trillion. Of this amount, about $9.65 trillion is called public debt, which refers to all federal securities held by foundations and individuals outside the United States Government. This includes China and other foreign States. The remaining debt - about $4.64 trillion - is maintained by the Federal Finance Bank, United States Government trust funds and other federal funds and accounts. The largest trust fund is the one that grants social security. Our discussion and calculations to verify this fact, as well as the Forbes accounts, are based on public debt. China buys United States Treasury bonds in public auctions, in the same way as other countries and investment companies buy our debt. The Treasury said that as of February 2011, China, together with Chinese companies and investment groups, had $1.15 trillion in American debt. Japan was the second largest foreign carrier, with $890.3 billion, while Great Britain's third share was $295.5 billion. In total, about $3.16 trillion of the United States public debt, or 33 per cent, is held abroad. The rest is owned by Americans. Because American debt has long been considered one of the safest investments in the world, the government can borrow money at very low costs, paying less than 2% of the average annual interest on its debt over the past decade. In fiscal year 2010, which ended on 30 September, the Federal Government spent $197 billion on interest payments on public debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If we divide this by 365 days, we reach an average daily interest of $539,726,027. Because Treasury does not make payments on weekends or holidays, and because debt payments vary depending on the date of issuance of the Treasury Memorandum, the actual daily figure may never have been this precise. On September 30, 2010, China seized about 12.8 percent of the public debt of the United States. If we assumed that China had received 12.8 per cent of our interest payments, it would have received approximately $68.9 million a day during fiscal year 2010. Forbes based his comments on the 2011 financial budget, in which community-based organizations estimated that the Government would spend $225 billion, or $616,438,356 per day, on interest payments. China held 12.1 per cent of public debt at the end of February. Therefore, if the 2011 estimates remain the same and China maintains the same proportion of debt throughout the year, it will receive some $74.4 million a day. Forbes made his calculations with the figures of the 16 March public debt. That explains the difference between his account and ours for $500,000. We do not know the exact mix of debt that China holds. If the debts held there were primarily short-term bonds, interest rates would be lower. If China often has bonds for 10 or 30 years, it will receive higher payments. Our calculations, and those of Forbes, assume that China's holdings of debt reflect the larger pool of United States debt. Let's review: Randy Forbes says the United States pays $73.9 million a day for China. His statistics were based on the percentage of United States debt held by China and the estimates by community-based organizations of how much we would spend on interest payments during fiscal year 2011. We have looked into the figures and discovered that, based on the data of civil society organizations and the Treasury, China is likely to have received approximately $68.9 million a day during fiscal year 2010. Based on the country &apos; s holdings in February and community organization data, China should receive approximately $74.4 million per day in payments during the current fiscal year. Forbes got the right numbers. We're assessing his statement right. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13196"}
