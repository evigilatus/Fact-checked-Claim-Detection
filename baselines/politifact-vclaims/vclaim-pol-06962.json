To make his point, he compared the city to what he referred to as the nation\u2019s poorest state.\n\"Our median income here in Providence is the same as the median income in Mississippi,\" he said.\nElorza noted that \u00a0Providence \"is a very poor city\" that lacks an adequate tax base to provide the services people want and need.\nWe wondered whether the mayor-elect got his facts right..\nWe asked Elorza spokeswoman Marisa O\u2019Gara where Elorza got his information.\nWhile waiting for her response, we plumbed U.S. Census Bureau data to see what we could find on our own. There, we learned that that the 2008-2012 American Community Survey five-year estimates placed the median household income in Providence at $38,243 and the median household income in Mississippi slightly higher, at $38,882.\nWe also reached out to Rhode Island Kids Count and its Mississippi counterpart. The two nonprofit research groups confirmed the figures. But researchers at both agencies urged us to further differentiate between median household income and median family income. (Elorza didn\u2019t say whether he was talking about household or family income.)\nThe Census Bureau defines family as a group of two or more people who are related. A household, meanwhile, is defined as all the people occupying a housing unit, including family members as well as those who are unrelated.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same \u00a0American Community Survey reported that the median family income in Providence was $43,378. \u00a0In Mississippi, it was substantially higher, \u00a0at $48,300.\nWe also asked the state Department of Labor and Training to weigh in. Spokesman Michael Healey provided figures from its labor market information division based on Census data for 2010 through 2013.\nThose figures also showed the median family income in Mississippi eclipsing that in Providence for each given year. In 2013, for example, the median family income in Mississippi was $47,615, compared to $45,122 in Providence.\nKids Count researchers cautioned that the five-year estimates were more reliable.\nOur ruling\nJorge Elorza said that the median income in Providence \"is the same as the median income in Mississippi.\" He made the comparison to illustrate how poor the capital city really is.\nIn fact, Providence\u2019s median income, both for households and for families, is actually lower than Mississippi\u2019s, not equal to it. While Elorza\u2019s comparison is slightly off, it supports his overall point.\nWe rule his claim Mostly True.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06962"}
