It includes transcripts of its interviews with the candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat appeared to be an excerpt of that interview soon showed up on Facebook.\u00a0\nThe post is a screenshot of a tweet that appears to show a portion of the New York Times transcript of one of Biden\u2019s answers. It reads:\u00a0\n\"By the way, and that\u2019s what some of those Bernie people don\u2019t get. You have to get the center, too. It\u2019s, I was eating a corn dog the other day, this is like a corn dog, with some mustard. When you get to the middle, it\u2019s hard and tough and dry [CHUCKLES], but you have to eat that, too. You have to eat that to finish it.
