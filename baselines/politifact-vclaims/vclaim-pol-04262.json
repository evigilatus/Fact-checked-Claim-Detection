You said it\u2019s the finest deal you\u2019ve ever seen.\"\nFor her part, Clinton rebutted that she at one time thought it could be the gold standard of trade deals before it was finished negotiated, but became disenchanted once it was finalized.\n\"I did say I hoped it would be a good deal,\" she said.\nShe similarly defended herself on this point during her primary campaign against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\nSo what did Clinton say about TPP?\nBack in 2012 when she was leading the State Department, Clinton was pretty effusive in her support of the deal. While in Australia, Clinton delivered remarks on the general topic of the U.S.-Australia relationship. Here\u2019s everything she said about the TPP in that address, with the \"gold standard\" comment in bold.\n\"So it's fair to say that our economies are entwined, and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner. This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\"\nAt that point, it seems clear Clinton is saying the TPP sets the gold standard. She didn\u2019t say she \"hoped\" it would.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung pointed to this statement in Australia to defend his candidate\u2019s statement.\nOther comments around the same time echoed similar assuredness that the TPP would meet that high bar. In November 2012 remarks in Singapore, she encouraged all nations \"willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP\" to join the deal.\n\"The so-called TPP will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment,\" she said, adding that it would result in better jobs with better wages and working conditions.\nShe did not say it was \"the finest deal\" she\u2019d ever seen. But here are some of the other words Clinton used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: \"exciting,\" \"innovative,\" \"ambitious,\" \"groundbreaking,\" \"cutting-edge,\" \"high-quality\" and \"high standard.\"\nNow, at that point, the deal was still being negotiated. And even before it was finalized, she started to temper her expectations for the deal as the campaign drew near.\nClinton spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to this passage in\u00a0her 2014 memoir Hard Choices:\n\"Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It\u2019s safe to say the TPP won\u2019t be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers.\"\nMore recently, after the deal was finalized last year and presented for Congress to approve, Clinton changed her position and now says she opposes it.\nIn the past when asked about her wording, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill noted that the \"gold standard\" comment was made during negotiations and because they were conducted in secret, we don\u2019t know if the final deal is dramatically different than it was in 2012. It\u2019s worth pointing out, too, that as secretary of state, she spoke as a representative of the Obama administration, which was and remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the \"gold standard\" of trade deals. Clinton did use that language in 2012 when discussing TPP in Australia. And unlike her rebuttal, she didn\u2019t couch it by saying she \"hoped\" it would be the gold standard. It\u2019s worth noting that at this point the deal was still under negotiation and because that was done behind closed doors, there\u2019s no way to know how much it changed. Before the final version came out, she advocated more of a wait-and-see approach.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/90008ff2-1952-4383-8676-be3604594811", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04262"}
