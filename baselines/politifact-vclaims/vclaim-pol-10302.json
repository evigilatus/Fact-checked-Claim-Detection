The evidence? That Obama supports adoption by same-sex couples and extended benefits to same-sex domestic partners of federal employees.\n\nBut that didn't come close to proving the claim. The links don\u2019t address: a) doctors b) surrogacy c) buying babies.\n\nNor do they address whether Obama would be interested in such an action. And a group that lobbies for equal treatment of gays and lesbians hasn\u2019t seen any such evidence.\n\n\"We cannot find any remotely related action or statement by the president or his administration that would lead anyone to such an outrageous conclusion,\" said Brian Moulton, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nExperts in surrogacy from a medical perspective had a similar reaction.\n\n\"We have no idea what this claim is based on,\" said Eleanor Nicoll, public affairs manager for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.\n\nBut even if Obama were interested, he would find a nearly impossible task (short of, say, suspending the rule of law).\n\nWhether surrogacy is legal is a matter of state law, not federal. In the District of Columbia, for example, attorneys could serve jail time for helping write a contract between prospective parents and a woman who wants to carry their child. In other states, surrogacy varies from perfectly legal to functionally impossible, according to a summary of state regulation from Maryland law firm Creative Family Connections.\n\nMichael Tanner, an expert in health care policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed out that even if the Obama administration managed to require non-discriminatory coverage for artificial reproductive technology in its health care law, doctors don\u2019t have to accept insurance, and they don\u2019t have to perform procedures.\n\n\"They can't supersede the surrogacy laws. They can't force physicians,\" he said. \"... That has got to be the most bizarre claim I have ever seen in my life.\"\n\nHe called it \"a fevered dream.\"\n\nJonathan Rauch, author of Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America, and a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution told us, \"Even a sane version of this claim is imaginary.\"\n\n Our ruling\n\nA newspaper ad claimed that \"Barack Hussein Obama will \u2026 force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies.\" There\u2019s no evidence Obama is interested in such a requirement. But even if he were, surrogacy laws vary by state and there\u2019s no mechanism to force doctors to perform a procedure. Experts found this claim \"outrageous,\" \"imaginary,\" and a \"fevered dream.\" We find it Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
