0001	John Dickerson	Mr. President, you and the administration said to North Korea, "Don't test a missile."
0002	John Dickerson	They have tested a missile.
0003	John Dickerson	Is the pressure not working?
0004	Donald Trump	Well, I didn't say, "Don't test a missile."
0005	Donald Trump	He's going to have to do what he has to do.
0006	Donald Trump	But he understands we're not going to be very happy.
0007	Donald Trump	And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect, the president of China, President Xi, I believe, has been putting pressure on him also.
0008	Donald Trump	But so far, perhaps nothing's happened and perhaps it has.
0009	Donald Trump	This was a small missile.
0010	Donald Trump	This was not a big missile.
0011	Donald Trump	This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago.
0012	Donald Trump	We'll see what happens.
0013	John Dickerson	You say, "Not happy."
0014	John Dickerson	What does that mean?
0015	Donald Trump	I would not be happy.
0016	Donald Trump	If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy.
0017	Donald Trump	And I can tell you also, I don't believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.
0018	John Dickerson	Not happy mean military action?
0019	Donald Trump	I don't know.
0020	Donald Trump	I mean, we'll see.
0021	John Dickerson	The Chinese, our allies, have been allies with North Korea.
0022	John Dickerson	How are you sure that they're not using this as a way to test you?
0023	Donald Trump	You can never be sure of anything, can you?
0024	Donald Trump	But I developed a very good relationship.
0025	Donald Trump	I don't think they want to see a destabilized North Korea.
0026	Donald Trump	I don't think they want to see it.
0027	Donald Trump	They certainly don't want to see nuclear on  from their neighbor.
0028	Donald Trump	They haven't liked it for a long time.
0029	Donald Trump	But we'll have to see what happens.
0030	Donald Trump	The relationship I have with China, it's been already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we've ever had.
0031	Donald Trump	But again, you know, we'll find out whether or not President Xi is able to affect change.
0032	John Dickerson	Why do
0033	Donald Trump	I hope he is.
0034	John Dickerson	Why do these missiles keep blowing up?
0035	Donald Trump	Well, I'd rather not discuss it.
0036	Donald Trump	But perhaps they're just not very good missiles.
0037	Donald Trump	But eventually, he'll have good missiles.
0038	John Dickerson	You don't want to discuss it because maybe we have something to do with it?
0039	Donald Trump	I just don't want to discuss it.
0040	Donald Trump	And I think you know me very well, where you've asked me many times over the last couple of years about military.
0041	Donald Trump	I said, "We shouldn't be announcing we're going into Mosul."
0042	Donald Trump	I said, "We shouldn't be announcing all our moves."
0043	Donald Trump	It is a chess game.
0044	Donald Trump	I just don't want people to know what my thinking is.
0045	Donald Trump	So eventually, he will have a better delivery system.
0046	Donald Trump	And if that happens, we can't allow it to happen.
0047	John Dickerson	What do you make of the North Korean leader?
0048	Donald Trump	I have  I really, you know, have no comment on him.
0049	Donald Trump	People are saying, "Is he sane?"
0050	Donald Trump	I have no idea.
0051	Donald Trump	I can tell you this, and a lot of people don't like when I say it, but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died.
0052	Donald Trump	He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others.
0053	Donald Trump	And at a very young age, he was able to assume power.
0054	Donald Trump	A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else.
0055	Donald Trump	And he was able to do it.
0056	Donald Trump	So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie.
0057	Donald Trump	But we have a situation that we just cannot let  we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue.
0058	Donald Trump	And frankly, this should've been done and taken care of by the Obama administration.
0059	Donald Trump	Should've been taken care of by the Bush administration.
0060	Donald Trump	Should've been taken care of by Clinton.
0061	John Dickerson	Let me ask you a question about the presidency.
0062	John Dickerson	George W. Bush said this about being president.
0063	John Dickerson	He said, "You think one thing going in, and then the pressures of the job or the realities of the world are different than you thought."
0064	John Dickerson	Do you agree?
0065	Donald Trump	I think I can agree with that.
0066	Donald Trump	I love doing it.
0067	Donald Trump	I'm, you know, thoroughly enjoying it.
0068	Donald Trump	It's always a challenge, like life itself is a challenge.
0069	Donald Trump	But it's something that I really love and I think I've done a very good job at it.
0070	John Dickerson	You said in an interview with Reuters that you thought it would be easier.
0071	John Dickerson	Why?
0072	Donald Trump	Well, it's a tough job.
0073	Donald Trump	But I've had a lot of tough jobs.
0074	Donald Trump	I've had things that were tougher, although I'll let you know that better at the end of eight years.
0075	Donald Trump	Perhaps eight years.
0076	Donald Trump	Hopefully, eight years.
0077	Donald Trump	But I'll let you know later on.
0078	Donald Trump	I think we've done very well with foreign policy.
0079	Donald Trump	I think we've done very, very well with relationships with other leaders.
0080	Donald Trump	I think we're doing great on trade deals.
0081	Donald Trump	It's set.
0082	Donald Trump	And I think we're doing well.
0083	Donald Trump	I mean, our country is being outtraded at every single point.
0084	Donald Trump	We're losing tremendous amounts of money on trade.
0085	Donald Trump	And I think actually, I've been very consistent.
0086	Donald Trump	You know, it's very funny when the fake media goes out, you know, which we call the mainstream media which sometimes, I must say, is you.
0087	John Dickerson	You mean me personally or?
0088	Donald Trump	Well, your show.
0089	Donald Trump	I love your show.
0090	Donald Trump	I call it Deface the Nation.
0091	Donald Trump	But, you know, your show is sometimes not exactly correct.
0092	Donald Trump	But when they talk about currency manipulation, and I did say I would call China, if they were, a currency manipulator, early in my tenure.
0093	Donald Trump	And then I get there.
0094	Donald Trump	Number one, they  as soon as I got elected, they stopped.
0095	Donald Trump	They're not  it's not going down anymore, their currency.
0096	John Dickerson	But that had been true before.
0097	John Dickerson	That had been true
0098	Donald Trump	No.
0099	John Dickerson	during the campaign, sir.
0100	Donald Trump	No, not true to the extent that we're talking about.
0101	Donald Trump	Much more important than that, as to when, but, you know, it did stop.
0102	Donald Trump	And I was talking about it all during the campaign.
0103	Donald Trump	And I would say that I was the one that got them to stop.
0104	Donald Trump	But forget that.
0105	John Dickerson	You were the one who got China
0106	Donald Trump	He is working with us
0107	John Dickerson	to stop manipulating their currency?
0108	Donald Trump	I think so, during the campaign I talked about.
0109	John Dickerson	Even if they were doing it before?
0110	Donald Trump	No, they were doing it before.
0111	Donald Trump	I mean, there was no question.
0112	Donald Trump	I mean, they were absolute currency manipulators before.
0113	Donald Trump	But somebody said, "Oh, you didn't call him a currency manipulator."
0114	Donald Trump	Now, you and I are just talking about how he's working  I believe that President Xi is working to try and resolve a very big problem, for China also.
0115	Donald Trump	And that's North Korea.
0116	Donald Trump	Can you imagine if I say, "Hey, by the way, how are you doing with North Korea?
0117	Donald Trump	Also, we're going to announce that you're a currency manipulator tomorrow."
0118	Donald Trump	So the mainstream media never talks about that.
0119	Donald Trump	They never say that.
0120	Donald Trump	And that's, you know, unfortunate.
0121	Donald Trump	It's just
0122	John Dickerson	Let me
0123	Donald Trump	it's just one of many things, John.
0124	John Dickerson	You're a negotiator.
0125	John Dickerson	If you need something from somebody, you need China to help you with North Korea, doesn't that send a message to China, "We're not going to bug you about human rights, about intellectual property.
0126	John Dickerson	In the South China Sea we're not going to put too much heat on you"?
0127	John Dickerson	Aren't you breaking one of your own negotiating rules?
0128	Donald Trump	No.
0129	Donald Trump	I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade.
0130	Donald Trump	Trade is very important.
0131	Donald Trump	But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed?
0132	Donald Trump	That, as we would say, trumps trade.
0133	John Dickerson	Let me ask you
0134	Donald Trump	Okay?
0135	Donald Trump	You understand what I'm saying.
0136	Donald Trump	And if I can use trade as a method to get China, because I happen to think that China does have reasonably good powers over North Korea.
0137	Donald Trump	Now, maybe not, you know, ultimate, but pretty good powers.
0138	Donald Trump	Now, if China can help us with North Korea and can solve that problem
0139	John Dickerson	Let me ask
0140	Donald Trump	that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the United States, excuse me, right?
0141	John Dickerson	What do you know now on day 100 that you wish you knew on day one of the presidency?
0142	Donald Trump	Well, one of the things that I've learned is how dishonest the media is, really.
0143	Donald Trump	I've done things that are I think very good.
0144	Donald Trump	I've set great foundations with foreign leaders.
0145	Donald Trump	We have you know  NAFTA, as you know, I was going to terminate it, but I got a very nice call from a man I like, the president of Mexico.
0146	Donald Trump	I got a very nice call from Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada.
0147	Donald Trump	And they said please would you rather than terminating NAFTA  I was all set to do it.
0148	Donald Trump	In fact, I was going to do it today.
0149	Donald Trump	I was going to do as we're sitting here.
0150	Donald Trump	I would've had to delay you.
0151	Donald Trump	I was going to do it today.
0152	Donald Trump	I was going to terminate NAFTA.
0153	Donald Trump	But they called up and they said, "Would you negotiate?"
0154	Donald Trump	And I said, "Yes, I will negotiate."
0155	John Dickerson	That's all you've learned, about the media?
0156	John Dickerson	You knew from the campaign about the media.
0157	John Dickerson	You said it all the time 
0158	Donald Trump	No, no, but the media didn't cover it that way.
0159	Donald Trump	The media said, oh, I didn't terminate NAFTA.
0160	John Dickerson	So
0161	Donald Trump	First of all, if you look at my statements, I said
0162	John Dickerson	No, no, I meant
0163	Donald Trump	If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, I will terminate NAFTA.
0164	Donald Trump	Well, I'll make that statement right now.
0165	John Dickerson	Here's a question.
0166	Donald Trump	If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, we will terminate NAFTA.
0167	John Dickerson	Let's step back a minute.
0168	Donald Trump	Okay.
0169	John Dickerson	Presidents have to learn how to adapt.
0170	John Dickerson	Every president comes into the job, it's different than they expect, they must adapt.
0171	John Dickerson	Surely, you've learned something else other than that the media is dishonest.
0172	Donald Trump	No, no, I'm just saying
0173	John Dickerson	And how do you adapt?
0174	Donald Trump	it was one of my disappointments.
0175	John Dickerson	Give me another thing you learned that you're going to adapt and change because all presidents have to at this stage.
0176	Donald Trump	Well, I think things generally tend to go a little bit slower than you'd like them to go.
0177	John Dickerson	Why?
0178	Donald Trump	Just a system.
0179	Donald Trump	It's just a very, very bureaucratic system.
0180	Donald Trump	I think the rules in Congress and in particular the rules in the Senate are unbelievably archaic and slow moving.
0181	Donald Trump	And in many cases, unfair.
0182	Donald Trump	In many cases, you're forced to make deals that are not the deal you'd make.
0183	Donald Trump	You'd make a much different kind of a deal.
0184	Donald Trump	You're forced into situations that you hate to be forced into.
0185	Donald Trump	I also learned, and this is very sad, because we have a country that we have to take care of.
0186	Donald Trump	The Democrats have been totally obstructionist.
0187	Donald Trump	Chuck Schumer has turned out to be a bad leader.
0188	Donald Trump	He's a bad leader for the country.
0189	Donald Trump	And the Democrats are extremely obstructionist.
0190	Donald Trump	All they do is obstruct.
0191	Donald Trump	All they do is delay.
0192	Donald Trump	Even our Supreme Court justice, as you know, who I think is going to be outstanding, Justice Gorsuch.
0193	Donald Trump	I think that it was disgraceful the way they handled that.
0194	Donald Trump	But, you know, I still have people, I'm waiting for them to be approved.
0195	Donald Trump	Our chief trade negotiator.
0196	Donald Trump	We can't get these people through.
0197	John Dickerson	I want to get to
0198	Donald Trump	They are obstructionists.
0199	Donald Trump	And you know what that's hurting?
0200	Donald Trump	It's hurting the country.
0201	John Dickerson	Let me ask you about health care  Tucker Carlson interviewed you about six weeks ago when you were in the middle of health care negotiations.
0202	John Dickerson	And you agreed with him that the health care bill wasn't going to help your supporters.
0203	John Dickerson	That those who lived in rural areas, the older, were going to get hurt by that bill.
0204	John Dickerson	And you told him
0205	Donald Trump	Excuse me, the health care bill is going to help my supporters.
0206	John Dickerson	Well, hold on.
0207	John Dickerson	Let me just finish the question, if I may, sir
0208	Donald Trump	Otherwise, I'm not going to sign it.
0209	Donald Trump	I'm not going to do it.
0210	John Dickerson	Well, this is why I wanted to ask you.
0211	John Dickerson	You said to Tucker, "We will take care of our people, or I am not signing it."
0212	John Dickerson	You said you were going to negotiate.
0213	Donald Trump	Well, that's what I just said.
0214	John Dickerson	So tell me what in the bill you've been negotiating to get
0215	Donald Trump	But let me
0216	John Dickerson	in that helps your supporters.
0217	John Dickerson	I'm just trying to get the details of how your people
0218	Donald Trump	Let me just tell you.
0219	John Dickerson	will be helped.
0220	Donald Trump	Preexisting conditions are in the bill.
0221	Donald Trump	And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, "Preexisting is not covered."
0222	Donald Trump	Preexisting conditions are in the bill.
0223	Donald Trump	And I mandate it.
0224	Donald Trump	I said, "Has to be."
0225	John Dickerson	So
0226	Donald Trump	We have, we're going to have lower premiums.
0227	Donald Trump	And before you start there, let me just tell you something.
0228	Donald Trump	Obamacare is dead.
0229	Donald Trump	Obamacare right now, all the insurance companies are fleeing.
0230	Donald Trump	Places like Tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies.
0231	Donald Trump	They're all going.
0232	Donald Trump	Obamacare, John, is dead.
0233	Donald Trump	Okay, because we're being  we're being compared to Obamacare.
0234	Donald Trump	Just, so.
0235	Donald Trump	Obamacare doesn't work
0236	John Dickerson	I just want to compare you to your own.
0237	Donald Trump	One thing.
0238	Donald Trump	No, no, it's important.
0239	Donald Trump	I've got to compare it.
0240	John Dickerson	No, no, but I want
0241	Donald Trump	But you were saying about Obamacare.
0242	John Dickerson	No, but I'm not.
0243	John Dickerson	I'm asking what
0244	Donald Trump	With Obamacare
0245	John Dickerson	you're going to do.
0246	Donald Trump	the premiums are too high.
0247	Donald Trump	The deductibles are through the roof, so you never get to use it.
0248	Donald Trump	But more importantly, it's dead.
0249	John Dickerson	So but in the bill, as it was analyzed, there were two problems.
0250	John Dickerson	One, and you talked about this with Congressman Robert Aderholt, who brought you the example of the 64yearold who under Obamacare the premiums
0251	Donald Trump	But that was a long time ago, John.
0252	John Dickerson	But has that been fixed?
0253	Donald Trump	Totally fixed.
0254	John Dickerson	How?
0255	Donald Trump	How?
0256	Donald Trump	We've made many changes to the bill.
0257	Donald Trump	You know, this bill is
0258	John Dickerson	What kind though?
0259	Donald Trump	very much different than it was three weeks ago.
0260	John Dickerson	Help us explain because there are people
0261	Donald Trump	The bill
0262	John Dickerson	out there wondering what kind of changes.
0263	Donald Trump	Let me explain.
0264	Donald Trump	Let me explain it to you.
0265	John Dickerson	Okay.
0266	Donald Trump	This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay?
0267	Donald Trump	This bill has evolved.
0268	Donald Trump	And we didn't have a failure on the bill.
0269	Donald Trump	You know, it was reported like a failure.
0270	Donald Trump	Now, the one thing I wouldn't have done again is put a timeline.
0271	Donald Trump	That's why on the second iteration, I didn't put a timeline.
0272	Donald Trump	But we have now preexisting conditions in the bill.
0273	Donald Trump	We have  we've set up a pool for the preexisting conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall.
0274	Donald Trump	We're taking across all of the borders or the lines so that insurance companies can compete
0275	John Dickerson	But that's not in
0276	Donald Trump	nationwide.
0277	John Dickerson	this bill.
0278	John Dickerson	The borders are not in
0279	Donald Trump	Of course, it's in.
0280	John Dickerson	this bill.
0281	John Dickerson	It's in that third bill, right, because
0282	Donald Trump	It's in the second phase.
0283	John Dickerson	Okay.
0284	Donald Trump	It's called phase one, phase two.
0285	Donald Trump	And that's, in effect, second phase, which will get approved, which will quickly get approved.
0286	John Dickerson	Let me
0287	Donald Trump	But let me just explain something.
0288	Donald Trump	There will be such competition.
0289	Donald Trump	Right now, there's no competition.
0290	Donald Trump	There will be such competition by insurance companies so that they can get health care and the people taking care of health care.
0291	John Dickerson	So
0292	Donald Trump	The other thing we're going to have is groups.
0293	Donald Trump	Groups of people can negotiate.
0294	Donald Trump	What's going to happen is the competition is going to drive down the premiums.
0295	Donald Trump	In my opinion, much, much more than people understand.
0296	John Dickerson	So what you've just described is the bill that you previously had said you worried wouldn't help your people.
0297	John Dickerson	And here's why I ask.
0298	John Dickerson	You said, "Preexisting conditions."
0299	Donald Trump	No, there were things in the other bill, the first version, which were not as good.
0300	John Dickerson	Okay.
0301	Donald Trump	But when I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don't cover preexisting conditions, we cover it beautifully.
0302	John Dickerson	Although
0303	Donald Trump	I'll tell you who doesn't cover preexisting conditions.
0304	Donald Trump	Obamacare.
0305	Donald Trump	You know why?
0306	Donald Trump	It's dead.
0307	John Dickerson	In one of the fixes that was
0308	Donald Trump	It's not going to be here.
0309	John Dickerson	In one of the fixes it was discussed preexisting was optional for the states
0310	Donald Trump	Sure, in one of the fixes.
0311	Donald Trump	And they're changing it
0312	John Dickerson	oh, okay.
0313	John Dickerson	So it'll
0314	Donald Trump	and changing.
0315	John Dickerson	be permanent?
0316	Donald Trump	Of course.
0317	John Dickerson	Okay.
0318	John Dickerson	Well, that's a development, sir.
0319	John Dickerson	So you're saying it's going to be preexisting to everybody?
0320	Donald Trump	John, this has evolved over a period of three or four weeks.
0321	Donald Trump	Now, we really have a good bill.
0322	Donald Trump	I think they could have voted on Friday.
0323	Donald Trump	I said, "Just relax.
0324	Donald Trump	Don't worry about this phony 100 day thing.
0325	Donald Trump	Just relax.
0326	Donald Trump	Take it easy.
0327	Donald Trump	Take your time.
0328	Donald Trump	Get the good vote and make it perfect."
0329	John Dickerson	Just to
0330	Donald Trump	Most importantly, we're going to drive down premiums.
0331	Donald Trump	We're going to drive down deductibles because right now, deductibles are so high, you never  unless you're going to die a long, hard death, you never can get to use your health care
0332	John Dickerson	Let me ask you something
0333	Donald Trump	because the deductibles are so high.
0334	John Dickerson	Okay.
0335	John Dickerson	So what I hear you saying is preexisting is going to be in there for everybody, it's not going to be up to the states?
0336	Donald Trump	Preexisting is going to be in there and we're also
0337	John Dickerson	And it's not up to the states?
0338	Donald Trump	going to create pools.
0339	John Dickerson	Okay.
0340	Donald Trump	And pools are going to take care of the preexisting.
0341	John Dickerson	But on that crucial question, it's not going to be left up to the states?
0342	John Dickerson	Everybody gets preexisting, no matter where they live?
0343	Donald Trump	No, but the states
0344	John Dickerson	Guaranteed?
0345	Donald Trump	are also going to have a lot to do with it because we ultimately want to get it back down to the states.
0346	John Dickerson	Okay.
0347	John Dickerson	Is it a guarantee?
0348	Donald Trump	Look, because if you hurt your knee, honestly, I'd rather have the federal government focused on North Korea, focused on other things, than your knee, okay?
0349	Donald Trump	Or than your back, as important as your back is.
0350	Donald Trump	I would much rather see the federal government focused on other things
0351	John Dickerson	Let me.
0352	Donald Trump	bigger things.
0353	Donald Trump	Now, the state is going to be in a much better position to take care, because it's smaller.
0354	John Dickerson	People out there with preexisting conditions, they are worried.
0355	John Dickerson	Are they going to have the guarantee of coverage if they have a preexisting condition or if they live in a state where the governor decides that's not a part of the health care, or that the prices are going to go up?
0356	John Dickerson	That's the worry.
0357	John Dickerson	The American Medical Association says
0358	Donald Trump	We actually
0359	John Dickerson	it could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable for people.
0360	Donald Trump	we actually have, well, forget about unaffordable.
0361	Donald Trump	What's unaffordable is Obamacare, John.
0362	John Dickerson	So I'm not hearing you, Mr. President, say there's a guarantee of preexisting conditions.
0363	Donald Trump	We actually have  we actually have a clause that guarantees.
0364	John Dickerson	Okay, excellent.
0365	John Dickerson	We got there.
0366	Donald Trump	We have a specific clause
0367	John Dickerson	Let me ask you
0368	Donald Trump	that guarantees.
0369	John Dickerson	about your tax plan.
0370	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0371	John Dickerson	Tax plan came out this week.
0372	John Dickerson	It's got some big deficit numbers.
0373	John Dickerson	You've said that's going to be made up by growth.
0374	John Dickerson	Congressional
0375	Donald Trump	Well, not only growth.
0376	Donald Trump	It's going to be made up by better trade deals.
0377	Donald Trump	It's going to be made up
0378	John Dickerson	Let me.
0379	Donald Trump	by many different, reciprocal tax.
0380	Donald Trump	As an example, we have countries where if we make a product and we send it to that country, they charge us 100% tax.
0381	Donald Trump	If they make the same product and send it to us, we charge them nothing.
0382	Donald Trump	You think that's smart?
0383	Donald Trump	It's not.
0384	John Dickerson	Look
0385	Donald Trump	We're going to come up with reciprocal taxes and lots of other things on those countries.
0386	Donald Trump	But I view that more in trade.
0387	Donald Trump	We're also going to fix all of our trade deals.
0388	Donald Trump	We're going to have a very wealthy country again.
0389	John Dickerson	Let me ask you this, Mr. President.
0390	John Dickerson	Congress may not go along with
0391	Donald Trump	Always.
0392	John Dickerson	so they're going to try and find some spending.
0393	John Dickerson	Let me ask you about the question of Medicare.
0394	John Dickerson	They're going to want, in Congress, to make up on the spending side, to change Medicare.
0395	John Dickerson	Will you allow that?
0396	Donald Trump	You're not going to have to do it.
0397	John Dickerson	But, sir, will you allow it?
0398	Donald Trump	You're not going to have to do it.
0399	Donald Trump	I'm just telling you we are
0400	John Dickerson	Does President Donald Trump want them not to do that?
0401	Donald Trump	I would much prefer them not to do that, that's right.
0402	John Dickerson	It sounds as if, having covered you in the campaign, it sounds like you're leaving the door open.
0403	John Dickerson	On the campaign, you were quite clear.
0404	John Dickerson	You said, "I'm the guy who's not going to touch Medicare."
0405	Donald Trump	Okay, then let me more clear.
0406	Donald Trump	I'm not going to touch it, because I said it.
0407	Donald Trump	Now, waste, fraud and abuse, I'm going to touch.
0408	Donald Trump	If there's something in Medicare that's been abused, I will touch that.
0409	Donald Trump	There are certain things, as you know, that have been absolutely abused.
0410	Donald Trump	There are certain provisions in Medicare that are horrible and abusive and there's been terrible things happening.
0411	Donald Trump	So that kind of stuff, I will absolutely touch.
0412	John Dickerson	So if I
0413	Donald Trump	But the concept of Medicare, I'm not touching.
0414	John Dickerson	For me, if I have it now, or if I'm going to have it in the future, it's not getting cut?
0415	Donald Trump	Waste, fraud and abuse.
0416	John Dickerson	And that's it?
0417	Donald Trump	And if there are things within Medicare that are being abused, I will touch that also.
0418	John Dickerson	Other than that, it's tightened up?
0419	Donald Trump	That's right.
0420	Donald Trump	That's what it is.
0421	Donald Trump	But here's what we do.
0422	Donald Trump	We're going to grow.
0423	Donald Trump	The numbers just came out for Obama's last year.
0424	Donald Trump	1.6 GDP.
0425	Donald Trump	That means nothing.
0426	Donald Trump	That's, like, 1% GDP.
0427	Donald Trump	So I have gotten to know as you know, I really get along with a lot of other countries.
0428	Donald Trump	So I talk to the heads of countries.
0429	Donald Trump	How are you doing?
0430	Donald Trump	Not well, not well.
0431	Donald Trump	Why?
0432	Donald Trump	GDP is 8%.
0433	Donald Trump	GDP is 9%.
0434	Donald Trump	We are doing poorly.
0435	Donald Trump	GDP  Our GDP is, like, 1%.
0436	John Dickerson	Let me ask you about your tax returns, sir.
0437	John Dickerson	When your Treasury secretary was asked about whether you were going to release them, Secretary Mnuchin said, "The president has no intention."
0438	John Dickerson	Is that right?
0439	Donald Trump	Well, I never spoke to him about it.
0440	Donald Trump	Honestly, he's never asked me about it.
0441	Donald Trump	I said, number one, I'm under audit.
0442	Donald Trump	Right now, I'm under audit.
0443	Donald Trump	After the audit is complete.
0444	Donald Trump	It's a routine audit, but I have a very big tax return.
0445	Donald Trump	You've seen the pictures.
0446	Donald Trump	My tax return is probably higher than that from the floor.
0447	Donald Trump	When you look at other people's tax return, even other wealthy people, their tax return is this big.
0448	Donald Trump	My tax return is this high.
0449	John Dickerson	I just wanted to make sure
0450	Donald Trump	I'm under routine
0451	John Dickerson	you weren't changing.
0452	Donald Trump	audit.
0453	Donald Trump	And I think it's a very unfair thing because I have been under audit almost, like, since I became famous, okay?
0454	John Dickerson	Have you
0455	Donald Trump	Not just political.
0456	Donald Trump	I mean, I have been under audit, I'll bet you 12 or 13 or 14 years in a row.
0457	Donald Trump	Now, I have friends that are wealthy people.
0458	John Dickerson	Let me ask you
0459	Donald Trump	They've never been audited.
0460	John Dickerson	You
0461	Donald Trump	And I think it's very unfair.
0462	John Dickerson	You first said that you were under audit, were going to wait till that was done, about 14 months ago.
0463	John Dickerson	That seems like a long time.
0464	John Dickerson	When do you think this might happen?
0465	John Dickerson	Are you asking them?
0466	Donald Trump	It could happen soon.
0467	Donald Trump	I don't know.
0468	Donald Trump	I mean, I think
0469	John Dickerson	When?
0470	John Dickerson	Give me a sense of
0471	Donald Trump	it's pretty routine, to be honest with you.
0472	Donald Trump	But then I'll make a decision.
0473	John Dickerson	A member of Congress suggested that a condition for getting tax reform would be releasing your tax returns.
0474	John Dickerson	What do you think about that?
0475	Donald Trump	Oh, I don't know who did that.
0476	Donald Trump	I mean, I don't care who did that.
0477	Donald Trump	These are the people, you know, the great obstructionists.
0478	John Dickerson	So you're not buying that deal.
0479	Donald Trump	Look where they are.
0480	Donald Trump	Look where the Democrats have ended up.
0481	Donald Trump	Hey, John, they had everything going.
0482	Donald Trump	Now they don't have the presidency, they don't have the House, they don't have the Senate, and Schumer's going around making a fool out of himself.
0483	John Dickerson	You said yesterday on Fox that Russia is a phony story.
0484	John Dickerson	Which part of it is phony?
0485	Donald Trump	The concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story.
0486	John Dickerson	Meaning the Trump campaign?
0487	Donald Trump	Of course, it's a total phony story.
0488	Donald Trump	In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration.
0489	John Dickerson	But you don't mean
0490	Donald Trump	Excuse me.
0491	Donald Trump	I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015 and he was on the Obama clearance.
0492	Donald Trump	When General Flynn came to us, as you now know, he already had the highest clearance you can have.
0493	Donald Trump	I think the same clearance as the president of the United States would have.
0494	Donald Trump	He had this really high clearance.
0495	Donald Trump	And, by the way, they're so devastated because this only came up two days ago.
0496	John Dickerson	Let me ask you this, sir.
0497	Donald Trump	Why wasn't this reported months ago?
0498	John Dickerson	I
0499	Donald Trump	But I watched one of your other competitors, and they were devastated
0500	John Dickerson	Look
0501	Donald Trump	by this news, because you know what?
0502	Donald Trump	That kills them.
0503	Donald Trump	That's the end of that subject.
0504	John Dickerson	You don't think it's phony that they, the Russians, tried to meddle in the election?
0505	John Dickerson	You believe that?
0506	Donald Trump	That, I don't know.
0507	Donald Trump	I don't know.
0508	John Dickerson	That you don't know or you do know?
0509	Donald Trump	Well, I have a problem.
0510	Donald Trump	You have Podesta, who, by the way, I understand has a company with his brother in Russia.
0511	Donald Trump	Hillary's husband makes speeches in Russia.
0512	Donald Trump	Hillary did a uranium deal with Russia.
0513	Donald Trump	Nobody ever talks about that.
0514	Donald Trump	But I don't know
0515	John Dickerson	You don't
0516	Donald Trump	because the FBI was not allowed by Podesta to go in and check all of the records on their servers and everything else that you would normally have to check.
0517	Donald Trump	That's number one.
0518	Donald Trump	Number two, knowing something about hacking, if you don't catch a hacker, okay, in the act, it's very hard to say who did the hacking.
0519	Donald Trump	With that being said, I'll go along with Russia.
0520	Donald Trump	Could've been China, could've been a lot of different groups.
0521	John Dickerson	So President Donald Trump is ambivalent
0522	Donald Trump	But it could've
0523	John Dickerson	about or not ambivalent, you're not just not sure?
0524	Donald Trump	No.
0525	Donald Trump	We have to find out what happened.
0526	Donald Trump	I'd love to find out what happened.
0527	John Dickerson	But you don't think it's the Russians
0528	Donald Trump	I can tell you one thing.
0529	Donald Trump	Had nothing to do with us.
0530	Donald Trump	Had nothing to do with this, and everyone knows it.
0531	Donald Trump	And by the way, even my enemies on your show said, "We haven't found anything that the Trump campaign did wrong."
0532	John Dickerson	But
0533	Donald Trump	Do you agree with that?
0534	John Dickerson	But there is agreement in the intelligence communities and other places and investigative communities on the Hill that Russia was
0535	Donald Trump	I'm okay with it.
0536	John Dickerson	involved in the election.
0537	Donald Trump	Honestly, John, I'm okay.
0538	Donald Trump	But why didn't Podesta and the Democrats, why didn't they allow the FBI to eject the server?
0539	Donald Trump	They hired some company who somebody said some pretty bad things about, to go and check their server and give the information.
0540	Donald Trump	So they were hacked.
0541	Donald Trump	Why didn't they  the Democrats allow the FBI?
0542	Donald Trump	They told the FBI, "We are not going to allow you to do it."
0543	Donald Trump	Why did they do that?
0544	Donald Trump	Why did they do that, John?
0545	Donald Trump	Why wouldn't they let the FBI go in and check?
0546	Donald Trump	And by the way, why didn't the FBI complain about it?
0547	John Dickerson	Mr. President, I think we're going to have to end it there.
0548	Donald Trump	Thank you.
