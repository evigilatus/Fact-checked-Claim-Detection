Critics of the Clintons speculated that the Clintons had killed Foster. Dan Burton, then a Republican congressman from Indiana, \"famously shot a melon in his backyard to \u2018prove\u2019 that Foster couldn\u2019t have killed himself,\" an Esquire story says. An autopsy concluded that he committed suicide, according to the story, but Foster\u2019s death still drew the attention of, among others, Brett Kavanaugh before he was a Supreme Court justice.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack then, Kavanaugh was on independent counsel Ken Starr\u2019s team when it looked into whether Foster was murdered. In early 1995, Kavanaugh offered Starr \"the legal rationale for expanding his investigation of the Arkansas financial dealings of President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, to include the Foster death,\" the Washington Post reported. \"Kavanaugh, then 30, argued that unsupported allegations that Foster may have been murdered gave Starr the right to probe the matter more deeply. Foster\u2019s death had already been the focus of two investigations, both concluding that Foster committed suicide.\"\nOne investigation by then-special counsel Robert Fiske involved four lawyers, five physicians, seven FBI agents, approximately 125 witnesses, and DNA tests, the Washington Post reported in 1994. \"According to Fiske,\" the paper said, \"Foster\u2019s death was a personal collapse, not a White House scandal.\"\nHe complained to his physician in Little Rock, Ark., about depression and anxiety, and his symptoms worsened when he got to Washington to work in the White House. After he bore some of the political fallout from an incident that became known as \"Travelgate,\" in which seven White House travel office employees were \"fired amid hints of financial shenanigans,\" he became \"increasingly obsessed\" with the affair and the possibility of a congressional hearing, the Washington Post said.\u00a0\n\"Though he was confident he and the White House had done nothing wrong,\" the paper wrote, \"he told his friend Webster L. Hubbell that \u2018in Washington you are assumed to have done something wrong even if you have not.\u2019\"\nAfter a series of critical editorials in the Wall Street Journal, he became more distraught, Fiske found. \"His anxiety over the congressional hearings deepened,\" according to the Post. He told his sister he was depressed. He ultimately shot himself once in the mouth with a gun.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nKavanaugh eventually affirmed the suicide finding and, in October 1997, Starr issued a report on Foster\u2019s death and concluded that Foster killed himself. But today, conspiracies continue to flourish. In 2016, for example, President Donald Trump called Foster\u2019s death \"very fishy.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16757"}
