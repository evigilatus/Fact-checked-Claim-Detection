Not much.", "text": "The editor's note: There's an earlier version of this story that wrongly refers to the time of Fox News's contact at Eastern Time. Fox called Wisconsin for Trump at 10:30 middle time. This does not affect the valuation of this claim. Wisconsin was a front and centre on the national scene on election day 2016. More specifically, on election night. Wisconsin, a major swinging state, was a point of contact for many networks as it tracked Donald Trump's journey to an unexpected victory. It was therefore surprising to hear Trump's reference to that timetable in his recent visit to our state on the battlefield. Trump said on July 12, 2019, during his address in Darko Aerospace, where he abandoned the agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. \"We didn't win it this late in the evening -- a little early in the evening, actually, and it's better.\" Let's redo the clock and see how the Trump novel matches reality. In nine of the polls, any type of \"early\" appeal to Wisconsin is difficult from the outset, given the number of states in the east. In those elections, polls in 27 states were more than half closed before the Wisconsin election at 8 p.m. Central Time, according to MSNBC. Fourteen other states were closed at the same time as Wisconsin, many of which related to them relatively early. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2012, the Associated Press Agency, which has been expecting races since 1848, was announced by news organizations throughout the country, and received a winner in nine of the 14 states within two hours of the conclusion of the polls. Contact Wisconsin didn't call Wisconsin until hours later. This is not surprising given the recent margin here was over 22,748 votes, with Trump outstripping Hillary Clinton by 47.2% to 46.5%, according to the Election Commission in Wisconsin. On 1:29 a.m., the People &apos; s Party called the State of Trump, while issuing a bulletin saying that Trump exceeded 270 votes and was elected President. CNN had contacted Wisconsin one minute earlier, although their expectations at that time were still 13 fewer electoral votes than the presidency. The Fox News, which called for the Trump race, was at 10:30 p.m. on election day, three and a half hours after the closing of the ballot box. Other networks did not follow suit. Even if you were using the record 10:30 p.m., Wisconsin was not among the \"former\" states. At that stage, the People &apos; s Parliament had already expected winners in 38 other states and in the province of Colombia. Our referee Trump said he won Wisconsin in \"A Little Early In the Evening\" in 2016. Fox News offered to win Trump here by 10:30 p.m., but it was weird. The AP and CNN were only calling for Trump at around 1:30 a.m. The early Fox News show was an extension anyway, as about 80% of the states had been invited by that point. We appreciate Trump's claim that it was wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00432"}
