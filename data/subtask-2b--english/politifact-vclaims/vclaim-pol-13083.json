They asked about Georgia\u2019s new immigration legislation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s response to recent, historic tornadoes that devastated towns across the Southeast.\n\nOne raised the touchiest -- literally -- of all of topics: getting patted down at the airport.\n\n\"Will we go past the grope-and-grab phase?\" a luncheon attendee asked Napolitano. \"The machines that scan the bodies and so forth? Are there better ways of doing it?\"\n\n\"Well, actually, very, very, very few people get a pat-down,\" Napolitano replied. \"It\u2019s only under very limited circumstances. They do, however, get -- those who are patted down -- tend to get on YouTube.\" she quipped.\n\n\"And look, look, no one wants to see a 6-year-old patted down. Even if it\u2019s done according to procedural protocol,\" she said. In April, a video was posted on YouTube.com of a 6-year-old girl being patted down at the New Orleans airport.\n\nJust this week, images of a baby getting frisked at Kansas City International Airport made headlines as well.\n\n\"Very, very, very\" few people? we wondered. That\u2019s a lot of \"very\"s.\n\nGiven the public outcry, Napolitano\u2019s estimate sent PolitiFact Georgia scribes scrambling.\n\nWe asked the Transportation Security Administration for more details. The TSA is part of the Department of Homeland Security and protects the nation\u2019s transportation systems.\n\nLast fall, the TSA began to use special scanners that showed images of passengers including what was underneath their clothing. Critics called it a \"virtual strip search\" and said it was too invasive.\n\nThe TSA offered pat-downs as an alternative, but these also frustrated critics. In October, the agency announced that officers would implement \"enhanced\" pat-down procedures. Previously, screeners used the backs of their hands to inspect sensitive areas. Now they use the front of their hands and conduct a more thorough search.\n\nAdults can also receive pat-downs on a random basis. Children receive \"modified\" pat-downs if they require extra screening.\n\nAs the busy Thanksgiving travel week approached, passengers complained about having their genitals and breasts touched. A video appeared on YouTube.com of a toddler crying during the pat-down and shouting for a screener to stop. Parents were outraged. Travelers threatened they would stop flying, and some predicted long airport security lines.\n\nThe expected chaos never materialized. For the most part, passengers went through the screening process without a fuss.\n\n\"All in all, people wanted to get to their destinations,\" said Christopher Bidwell, a security expert with the industry group Airports Council International.\n\nWe asked the TSA how many pat-downs it conducts at the nation\u2019s airports.\n\nAtlanta TSA spokesman Jon Allen told us that during March, 3 percent of air passengers were subject to a pat-down. The TSA collects this data by monitoring \"data from select airports throughout the year,\" he wrote in an email. That number is \"consistent with that of previous time periods.\"\n\nPolitiFact Georgia looked for other pat-down data to see whether other groups have verified TSA numbers. Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union and passenger rights groups did not. Neither did industry groups we contacted. \u00a0\n\nWe did find a Gallup poll conducted Nov. 19-21 that said 15 percent of adults who have flown two or more times in the past year received a full-body pat-down. The survey\u2019s margin of error was 4 percentage points.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 15 percent figure does not contradict the TSA figures. The more often you pass through a security checkpoint, the more chance you\u2019ll receive a pat-down.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia therefore took the TSA figures and did some math. The TSA\u2019s Allen told us that \"on an average day, about 2 million people are screened at TSA checkpoints.\" Three percent of 2 million is 60,000 people.\n\nThat means that over the course of a month, roughly 1.8 million people receive a pat-down. That\u2019s more than four times the population of Atlanta.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like \"very, very, very\" few people to us.\n\nIf Napolitano said that \"a small percentage of passengers\" get patted down each month, she would have been correct. But she talked about \"people.\" In addition, she used the superlative \"very\" three times, even though the TSA\u2019s own figures show that the numbers of passengers who receive a pat-down can top 1 million in a single month.\n\nWe rate her statement Pants On Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13083"}
