Probably not.", "text": "President Donald Trump sought to place migration at the centre of the final days of the 2018 midterm elections. One of its greatest objectives was the cities of refuge - a rather vague term that refers to locations that limit their cooperation with federal immigration law enforcement authorities. We've already evaluated Pants on fire on a permit from Trump at a campaign rally. He said that in California, \"they're a riot now\" on the cities of refuge. Officials said that there was no evidence of that allegation. But are Californians unhappy with the cities of refuge, not really rioting? Trump had claimed to have done so at a gathering in Willing, and... \"If you want to secure our borders, if you want to stop the cities of refuge, which are even in California now, they don't want to be the cities of refuge anymore,\" said Trump. \"They want out. You see that. They're rebelling! In California, of all the places they rebel.\" We have found that the views of Californians about the cities of refuge present a more complex picture. California became the so-called sanctuary state in October 2017 when democratic rule took place. Jerry Brown signed a law limiting cooperation between local law enforcement and federal authorities in immigration cases. On the one hand, the newspaper San Jos\u00e9 Mercury News published in April that \"at least 14 cities in Southern California and two provinces have passed laws and, in some cases, brought lawsuits\" against the State-wide Shelter Act. However, these sites are home to a small part of Californian population, and public opinion data show that the general population supports the laws of refuge, as we mentioned earlier. \u2022 In November 2017, a survey conducted by the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times found that 53 percent of them were preferred and 29 percent opposed the legislation of the state of California. \u2022 A survey conducted by the Institute of State Studies at the University of California in Berkeley in March 2017 found that 56 per cent of the population supported communities and opposed \"communities declaring themselves a haven for cities and instructing local police and government officials not to automatically hand over migrants to federal immigration officers when they were found illegally in the country.\" Support was weaker when the question was asked differently: 53 per cent opposed and 47 per cent supported allowing cities and districts the right to disregard the federal authorities &apos; requests to detain illegal immigrants who had been arrested and were about to be released. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 The California Institute of Public Policy in May 2017 specifically inquired about the legislation of the state of the asylum in California. 48 percent of adults were found in his favor and 42 percent were opposed. \u2022 A survey conducted by the California Institute of Public Policy in January 2017 showed that 58 per cent of potential voters are \"the best government of the state of California and local governments that formulate their own policies and take action - separate from the federal government - to protect the rights of undocumented migrants living in the state.\" Only 39% said they were opposed. \u2022 The recent poll, released in April 2018 by the University of California Berkeley Institute of Government Studies, revealed 56 per cent support for California law and 41 per cent opposition. The views are strong in favour of or against: 38 per cent said that they strongly supported him and 32 per cent said that they strongly opposed him. Mark Decamillo, IGS Survey Manager, said earlier this year that views on asylum policies \"dance according to how to frame the case.\" Californians preferred to allow cities to declare themselves a haven and to allow them to choose not to automatically hand over migrants to federal authorities. But he added: \"Only ignoring a federal request is not popular. It's very divisive.\" He said: \"There are differences between things in my opinion that affect public opinion and how they are measured.\" The experts added that the increasing definition of Trump himself as opposed to the cities of refuge had made the issue more polarized on a party basis. In California, a generally strong democratic State, this helped to guide public opinion against Trump's attitude. Our Governor Trump said, \"So in California now, they don't want to be cities of refuge anymore. They want out.\" A number of Californian cities have moved to challenge the state asylum law. However, the majority of residents who express support for the law are more widely reflected in public opinion. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.
