A former Democratic senator from North Dakota says warning signs from farm country don\u2019t bode well for him.\nOn ABC\u2019s This Week, Heidi Heitkamp said the economy is starting to show weak spots.\n\"One of the leading indicators in the economy is agriculture,\" she said. \"We have record bankruptcies in farming country.\"\nAre there really \"record bankruptcies in farming country\"?\nWe found that the farm bankruptcy rate is exceeding historical norms in the upper Midwest, which includes Heitkamp\u2019s home state of North Dakota. But experts told us the term \"farming country\" has no official definition, making the national picture the most relevant measurement.\nAnd nationally, the farm bankruptcy rate has been fairly steady, and in fact sits well below the highs of just a few years ago.\nWhat are farm bankruptcies?\nFarmers can actually file under four possible chapters of the bankruptcy code, said Robert Dinterman, a researcher with Ohio State University\u2019s Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics. They are chapters 7, 11, 12, and 13.\nEach variety of bankruptcy has its own parameters and requirements (here\u2019s a breakdown from the trade publication AgWeek), but the chapter most commonly used to keep track of farm bankruptcies is chapter 12. That\u2019s because it\u2019s the only one that is exclusively reserved for farmers and fishermen. Court data does not distinguish between farm filings and non-farm filings under the other chapters, so it\u2019s far more difficult to track the number of farm-specific bankruptcies under those chapters.\nChapter 12 bankruptcy was created in 1986 as a response to the worst farm crisis since the Great Depression, which had been caused by a mix of factors, including low commodity prices, high debt levels, high inflation, high gas prices, and a grain embargo against the Soviet Union.\nHeitkamp\u2019s evidence\nHeitkamp\u2019s office pointed us to a Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis report from Nov. 14, 2018, and a Wall Street Journal article from Feb. 6, 2019.\nThe Fed report found that over the 12 months ending in June 2018, the states comprising most of the bank\u2019s region -- Minnesota, Montana, North and South Dakota plus parts of Wisconsin -- accounted for 84 farm bankruptcies under chapter 12, more than twice the level seen in June 2014 and a high going back to at least 2007. Here\u2019s a chart from the report:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal article, meanwhile, found that bankruptcies in three judicial districts had hit 10-year highs -- the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin), the Eighth Circuit (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas), and the Tenth Circuit (Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma). Those circuits accounted for nearly half of all U.S. farm sales, the Journal reported.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The region stretching from North Dakota to Oklahoma, and from Utah to Indiana, may be facing higher levels of farm bankruptcies than at any point in the past decade or so. But these states are still just a portion of U.S. \"farming country\" -- for instance, two of the top three states in cash receipts for all commodities in 2017 were California and Texas, both of which are outside the region highlighted by these reports.\nAnd the farm bankruptcy picture is different if you look at the nation as a whole.\nNational figures\nCourt data compiled by the American Farm Bureau Federation, a trade group, found that chapter 12 filings nationwide actually fell by about 1 percent in 2018, and that the 2018 level was below the 10-year average.\n\"Bankruptcies are not at record levels,\" John Newton, the Farm Bureau\u2019s chief economist, told PolitiFact.\nLonger-term statistics concur.\nCourt data compiled by Dinterman and Ani Katchova of Ohio State found that chapter 12 filings were higher for several years after the Great Recession than they are now, and were higher still around 2003.\n\nAn even longer-term look published by Dinterman and Katchova shows that the bankruptcy rate was vastly higher during the 1980s farm crisis, although that peak is not directly comparable because it occurred before the advent of chapter 12. (In fact, the high rates of that era were the reason the law was passed in the first place.)\n\nDespite the regional variations, the national farm bankruptcy rate is generally \"stable,\" Dinterman told PolitiFact. \"Nationally, we saw higher farm bankruptcies in the 2009 to 2012 period,\" he said.\nThere are other problems facing farmers beyond the bankruptcy numbers, according to the Farm Bureau, including heavier-than-normal debt loads. And Heitkamp\u2019s office cited projections of declining farm profits made by the Agriculture Department in November 2018, which would put profits near their lowest level since 2002.\nSo there are certainly warning signs for farm country. But Heitkamp\u2019s statement on This Week is overly broad.\nOur ruling\nHeitkamp said, \"We have record bankruptcies in farming country.\"\nIn her backyard, the upper Midwest, farm bankruptcies have indeed reached their highest level in at least a decade. But nationally, farm bankruptcies are holding steady, perhaps even falling slightly, and they sit below the levels seen as recently as 2009 to 2012.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2019-02-26 17:10:57 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"We have record bankruptcies in farming country.\"    Heidi Heitkamp former U.S. Senator, D-N.D. https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-24-19-rep-adam-schiff-andrew/story?id=61272409   a roundtable on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday, February 24, 2019 2019-02-24    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00973"}
