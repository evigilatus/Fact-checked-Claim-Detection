Ojeda, II (@VoteOjeda2020) October 4, 2019 \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that cannabis-based products can help ease the side effects of chemotherapy and muscle spasms from multiple sclerosis.\u00a0\nA 2015 article in the journal Substance Abuse reviewed prior studies and expressed some optimism about CBD\u2019s usefulness in combating some addictions, though it found less evidence for alcohol specifically. A second article from 2019 in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research found, based on rodent trials, that \"CBD appears to have promise\" for treating alcohol use disorder, but the authors cautioned that more research needs to be done to confirm this effect in human subjects.\nToo little is known about the effects of CBD on alcohol abuse for us to address that part of Ojeda\u2019s tweet.\nBut what about Ojeda\u2019s statistic, that \"one in eight American adults, or 12.7% of the U.S population, now meets diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder\"?\nWe found significant uncertainty when it comes to measuring how many Americans have issues with alcohol. (Ojeda did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\nWhat is alcohol use disorder?\nThe National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a part of the National Institutes of Health, defines alcohol use disorder as uncontrolled and problematic drinking. The institute considers alcohol use disorder to be synonymous with the more commonly used term \"alcoholism.\"\nThere are different ways to measure the extent of alcohol abuse.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 25.1% of adults age 18 or older have had at least one heavy drinking day during the past year. This comes from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey, which defined a heavy drinking day as five or more drinks consumed (for men) and four or more (for women).\nMeanwhile, a different federally sponsored survey, the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, used another definition -- people reporting that they engaged in heavy alcohol use in the past month. The survey defined heavy alcohol use as having at least five drinks (for men) or four drinks (for women) on at least five days in the past month.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the survey found that 6.7% of respondents reported that they had engaged in heavy alcohol use during the past month. Drinking to this level on a very frequent basis can be indicative of a problem, although there is not a clear consensus on exactly how often -- and this by itself does not constitute an alcohol use disorder.\nOfficially, the same survey found that 14.1 million adults -- 9 million men and 5.1 million women -- have alcohol use disorder. That works out to 5.7% of the adult population.\u00a0\nThe JAMA Psychiatry article\nThis 5.7% figure is smaller than Ojeda\u2019s 12.7%. So where did that come from?\nIt appears to have come from a study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry in 2017. In fact, Ojeda\u2019s wording is taken straight from a Washington Post article describing the study.\nThe study was based on data from the federally sponsored National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Its headline finding was that the prevalence of alcohol use disorder has spiked, rising by 49% in the first decade of the 2000s.\nSpecifically, the percentage of adults meeting the criteria for alcohol use disorder rose from 8.5% in 2001-02 to 12.7% in 2012-13.\nAnother review of alcohol use disorder was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2018 said the percentage could be even higher. Alcohol abuse disorder \"is present in up to 14% of US adults during a 1-year period,\" the authors wrote.\nWhy the variation in statistics?\nThe differences between the dueling federal studies have been striking enough that researchers published a paper about it in 2007 in the journal Addiction. They suggested a variety of reasons may be causing the variations, notably the divergent policies on anonymity for respondents. Technical factors like data weighting, question wording, and response format may be making a difference as well.\nOjeda would not have needed to dig up the 2007 study to understand this background -- the Washington Post article that his assertion originally came from included a section noting this caveat.\n\"While the study's findings are alarming, a different federal survey, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, has shown that alcohol use disorder rates are lower and falling, rather than rising, since 2002,\" the article said. It quoted the JAMA Psychiatry study's lead author, National Institutes of Health researcher Bridget Grant, saying she isn\u2019t sure what is behind the discrepancies.\nKenneth Leonard, director of the Clinical and Research Institute on Addictions at the University of Buffalo, told PolitiFact that he agreed with this description of the two surveys.\nOur ruling\nOjeda tweeted, \"One in eight American adults, or 12.7% of the U.S population, now meets diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder.\"\nThis statistic comes from a peer-reviewed study that was based on federal survey data. However, by citing only this study, Ojeda glosses over the reality that a different federal study showed rates about half as high. Researchers have suggested that the dueling studies may be reporting divergent numbers due to differences in their methodologies. At this point, it\u2019s impossible to say whether the 12.7% statistic is accurate or if it\u2019s actually half that. There is valid evidence for both numbers, and researchers can\u2019t fully account for the difference.\u00a0\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16801"}
