But a viral post floating around social media suggests the same charges should be thrown in Trump\u2019s direction.\nThe picture, a spin-off of a 2016 cartoon showing Trump hoarding bags of cash, tags Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, her husband Jared Kushner, and the children of Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr as benefactors of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\"Trump\u2019s daughter works at the White House,\" the text says. \"Her husband works at the White House.

Trump\u2019s daughter is getting Chinese patents and Saudi grants. But sure, let\u2019s talk about Hunter Biden.\"\nThe image has been circulating on Facebook and Twitter since at least early December, when the House was moving toward impeaching Trump after a whistleblower complaint sounded alarms about Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to announce an investigation into the Bidens.\u00a0\nOne post from Occupy Democrats, a liberal advocacy group, received over 22,000 likes and more than 23,000 shares on Facebook. Actor John Leguizamo also shared the image.\nThe posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe decided to break down the family claims one by one.\nFamily ties in the White House, U.S. government\nTrump, Barr and Giuliani all have family members working in top positions at the White House and other government agencies, according to LinkedIn, news reports and the White House\u2019s latest annual report to Congress on its personnel. Here\u2019s what we found:\n\u2022 Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, works as an adviser to the president and makes no salary.\n\u2022 Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband, works as an assistant and senior adviser to the president. He also takes no salary.\n\u2022 Andrew Giuliani, Giuliani\u2019s son, works as a special assistant to the president and associate director of the office of public liaison. He\u2019s paid $95,000 per year.\u00a0\n\u2022 Tyler McGaughey, Barr\u2019s son-in-law, works as an associate in the White House counsel\u2019s office with an annual salary of $125,792.\n\u2022 Mary Daly, Barr\u2019s daughter, works as a senior adviser to the director of the Treasury Department\u2019s financial crimes unit, according to news reports and her LinkedIn profile.\nIvanka Trump and Kushner have had White House roles since the early months of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, with Ivanka Trump formally occupying her position in March 2017 and Kushner swearing in just days after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u00a0\nKushner\u2019s appointment came after the Justice Department wrote a memo concluding that the White House was exempt from violating federal anti-nepotism laws.\nAndrew Giuliani, a former Trump campaign volunteer, was first appointed in March 2017, with a starting salary of $77,000, per the White House\u2019s 2017 report.\n\nAndrew Giuliani and his former girlfriend, Olympic figure skater Sarah Hughes, at the world premiere of 'The Other Guys' in New York on Monday, Aug. 2, 2010.

(AP/Ceneta)\nOther administrations, including under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have seen relatives of high-ranking party leaders and administration officials in government positions.\u00a0\nForeign business and patents\nThe image also takes aim at Eric and Donald Trump Jr. for their management of the Trump Organization, as well as at Ivanka Trump for her own business interests.\nIn October 2019, Eric Trump said, \"When my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business.\" We rated that claim Pants on Fire.\nWhen Donald Trump became president, he transferred ownership of the Trump Organization to his sons and pledged that \"no new deals\" would be done during his time in office.\nBut as we\u2019ve documented, the Trump sons have put almost no stops to their overseas business dealings. They have traveled the globe, managing properties and moving on deals they insist were signed or in-the-works before their father moved into the White House.\u00a0\nMultiple news outlets and accountability groups have kept track of their international activities, and in some cases, the Trump children have publicly celebrated their endeavors.\nCongratulations to our extraordinary @TrumpScotland team! Minutes ago, we received full & total approval for a new phase of development to include 500 homes, 50 cottages, sports center, retail & more. We also received approval to build a 2nd golf course! Very proud of them! pic.twitter.com/odVxomGdmf\u2014 Eric Trump (@EricTrump) September 26, 2019 \nAs for Ivanka Trump, it\u2019s misleading to say she\u2019s \"getting Chinese patents and Saudi grants.\"\nThe president\u2019s daughter kept her international fashion business going for 18 months after her father\u2019s election before shutting it down. Amid trade talks with China in 2018, she received a number of trademarks from the country related to her products. She added more in 2019, as well.\nTrademarks are slightly different from patents. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, a trademark protects a symbol, logo, design, name or word meant to identify the person or company behind a product, while a patent protects a person or company\u2019s new invention.\nIn May 2017, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced their pledge to contribute $100 million to a World Bank fund meant to help women entrepreneurs and small-business owners around the world, according to reports. The fund was Ivanka Trump\u2019s idea.\nBut as Snopes noted, she does not have a hands-on role with the project, nor is she lining her pockets because of it.\nOur ruling\nA viral image said: \"Trump\u2019s daughter works at the White House. Her husband works at the White House. Rudy\u2019s son works at the White House. Barr\u2019s son-in-law works at the White House. Barr\u2019s daughter works at Treasury. Trump\u2019s sons do foreign business. Trump\u2019s daughter is getting Chinese patents and Saudi grants.\"\nThe post gets the White House and government positions right, as well as the fact that the Trump sons are still conducting business internationally.\nWhere it errs is in its portrait of the Saudi grants delivered to the World Bank for a project Ivanka Trump proposed. She does not stand to benefit from them financially.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17376"}
