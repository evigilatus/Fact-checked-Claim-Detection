Bush proposed limiting guaranteed admissions to spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens.\n\n\nBy 2011, of the one million immigrants granted permanent legal residence, \"nearly 65 percent -- almost two-thirds -- of all new permanent residents obtained that status by virtue of their family status.\"\n\n\nWe wanted to check Bush\u2019s numbers: Are almost two-thirds of new legal permanent residents here based on their family status?\n\n\nThe numbers\n\n\nBush obtained information from a January 2011 policy brief from the Brookings Institution. The author, Brookings vice president Darrell West, called for immigration reform that in the short term would allow employers to hire workers with scientific and technological skills.\n\n\nWest\u2019s number drew from a group known as legal permanent residents, commonly referred to as green card holders. In 2011, about one million people became legal permanent residents, according to the federal government\u2019s yearbook of immigration statistics. Those who entered based on family ties accounted for about 65 percent.\n\n\nThat included about 235,000 who were family-sponsored preferences and about 453,000 who were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.\n\n\nImmediate relatives include spouses, children under the age of 21 or parents of U.S. citizens. If approved, the U.S. government immediately grants those visas for relatives, and there isn\u2019t a quota.\n\n\nFamily sponsored immigrants includes spouses and children of legal permanent residents as well as other relatives of citizens such as siblings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government grants up to 226,000 family sponsored visas per year, and 140,000 employment-based visas per year. In addition, there are limits to the percentage of visas that can be allotted to each country.\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Notice that the quota of 226,000 family sponsored visa cap was slightly lower than the 235,000 number of those admitted in 2011. That\u2019s because the quota refers to the number of visas -- valid for six months -- issued in a year, while the immigration statistics yearbook number refers to the actual admissions. So someone can be issued a visa in 2010 but may not travel until 2011.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are a few important exceptions within the different categories, though. Jeffrey Passel, at Pew Research Hispanic Center, said in an email that most immigrants come for work even if they came here under a family or relative category. And not all of the employment-visas are for workers, since the \"employment-based\" category also includes visas for spouses and children of the workers.\n\n\nThe current debate about overhauling the U.S. immigration system pits those who want to protect family reunification against those who say our economy would benefit from a heavier focus on letting in immigrants based on needed job skills.\n\n\nIn his book, Bush argues the focus on family reunification leads to \"crowding out most others, including immigrants who would contribute greatly to economic growth.\" If the U.S. wants to increase work-based immigrants without increasing immigration overall, it will have to narrow the definition of \"family,\" Bush wrote.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nBush said that by 2011, of the one million immigrants granted permanent legal residence, \"nearly 65 percent -- almost two-thirds -- of all new permanent residents obtained that status by virtue of their family status.\"\n\n\nBush correctly cites the numbers, and his broader point is correct, too -- our system favors family reunification.\n\n\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09558"}
