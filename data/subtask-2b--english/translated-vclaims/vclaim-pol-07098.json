On a web page describing its proposal in the November 2014 ballot, the city states that \"road improvement projects are designed to reduce overcrowding, promote mobility and manage traffic in nine \"vessels,\" including among the 35 states. Stop applause, say one group. In a radio announcement, the narrator told citizens against railway taxes that the railway part of the plan would not ease the traffic. And the $400 million that the city is promising us for road projects? The narrator says. \"Guess how much of that money will be used to add new paths to our busy ways. None. Zero.\" Nothing? On the telephone, Jim Scags, the Group's treasurer, indicated that the announcement did not identify any new corridors on the city's \"crowded\" roads. That was a wave, as he said, on the routinely blocked mobak Avenue, I-35 and U.S. 183. Scage said, \"There are some things on the front road\" in the proposal. He said, \"But they don't add any miles to our crowded highways.\" When we asked about the city and Texas transport administration officials, each said that, unlike the allegation, the 400 million dollars mentioned would result in about 15 miles of new or extended corridors or what engineers call corridor miles, an area calculation based on the amount added to the pier, and perhaps not always what a motorist thinks when he perceives a new pier. Specifically, city spokesman Samantha Alexander said that some of the promised expenditure would go to projects related to access to and from I-35 south of Lake Lady Bird, and there would also be projects related to Texas 71 - in addition to one new corridor on part of FM 1826 in South West Austin, for example. The Austin Strategic Mobility Plan 2014, adopted by the Austin City Council in June 2014, contains a chart outlining how to spend $400 million: Source: Austin City, Strategic Mobility Plan 2014 (deleted on 10 October 2014), requesting TXDOT to highlight the details. By e-mail, Kelly Reyna's spokesman provided a breakdown of 10.5 miles of corridors that would be close to I-35 near Riverside Drive, Ulturf Street or William Cannon Drive. At first, we got the impression that most of these projects, costing about $200 million, would simply expand the front roads or corridors designed to facilitate traffic faster than the highway to the streets of the city. By telephone, Steve Miller, consultant to TxDOT on projects I-35, advised otherwise. About seven additional corridors explained by Miller include: -- two additional corridors, one northward and one southward, making it possible for drivers to enter and leave I-35 without facing the riverbank traffic signal; -- an additional corridor, south and northward, between the exit and entry corridors under Ultorf, and the easing of traffic on the highway in both directions, as well as an additional corridor in each direction that makes it easier to reach Ben White Boulevard from and from Ulturf; -- Lanes added the facilitation of the flow of direct traffic between Wyatt, heading south - or flying over - south after William Cannon and another corridor northbound from South Stasney Lane to the plane arriving at Ben White. Also in both directions, corridors will be added to facilitate traffic from exit and entry corridors to and from East Stasny Lin and William Cannon. The TxDOT collapse also indicates about 3.9 miles in the corridors that will be added outside the U.S. 183 and Texas 71 to improve traffic flow east of Austin Airport. Finally, the collapse says that a mile-long corridor will be added to FM 1826 in southwest Austin. According to the American Austin news story of October 4, 2014, this corridor will be added between Slater Lane and 290 Americans. Terry McCoy, Deputy District Engineer TxDOT of Austin's office, said that the final plan was to build four tracks, with a middle corridor or a left-hand corner in the centre, but the city's money might only be sufficient for a temporary version of three tracks. We shared the collapse of TxDOT with Scags, who said that planned projects do not attack crowded main roads. \"It's front and road links, cross paths and links to 71 and 183 at the airport,\" said Scugs by e-mail, \"not traffic priorities.\" From another perspective, we moved to the Transport Policy Research Centre, part of the Texas Transport Institute at the University of Texas A&M. Through e-mail, the director of the Centre, Ginger Gooden, described the traffic lines as a legitimate measure of cumulative improvements before saying that she saw projects that would be funded in the amount of $400 million as additional corridors and the reduction of overcrowding. Godin noted the part of I-35 between the U.S. 290 and Texas 71 ranks No. 2 on the list of states with 100 busier roads. Godin also said that the projects described - including so-called collection methods - distribution, auxiliary corridors and intersecting improvements - were acceptable strategies for reducing overcrowding recognized by the Institute. In general, Godeen called the citizens' manifesto against railway taxes \"mistake.\" Part of the funding will go towards adding the corridors to IH-35, the busiest road in the area, \"Judine said. Our ruling citizens against railway taxes said none of the $400 million the city of Austin proposes to spend on road projects \"will be used to add new corridors to crowded roads.\" There are other ways to say that the I-35 highway will not become a 10-line highway under the $400 million plan. However, the announcement of citizen radio against railway taxes is based on a comprehensive formulation or nothing that ignores the miles of new roads that will be built with money, much of which has been intended to ease overcrowding in areas of notorious unrest.
