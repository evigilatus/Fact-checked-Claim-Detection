But all kidding aside, of all my years in the Senate, I have never in my life seen Washington so broken.\"\n\n\nIt's true that with 35 years, Biden is one of the most senior lawmakers in the Senate, where seniority is based primarily on the length of consecutive Senate service. But Biden's not ranked fifth as he suggests. Rather, he's sixth, just below New Mexico Republican Pete Domenici.\n\n\nThe top-ranking senior senators are Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., with 49 years; Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., with 46 years; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, with 45 years; and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, with 40 years.\n\n\nBiden can perhaps be forgiven the slip, since he and Domenici were sworn in on the same day in 1973 (Biden was 30 years old). Domenici's 35 years are ranked higher, though, because Senate rules break ties by taking other factors into account, such as which state is more populous (a contest New Mexico wins handily over Delaware). Also, Domenici has announced that he won't be seeking re-election when his term expires in January 2009, so Biden soon will assume that No. 5 spot.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also true that Biden, 65, is younger than many of his senatorial peers \u2014 40 to be exact, four less than he stated.\n\n\nRanking above him are: Byrd (90), Stevens (84), Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
