In one of the articles published on October 22, one novel called \"The Total Health\" and more,\" which contains more than 165,000 followers, claimed that the influenza injection could lead to the death of embryos. \"420% increase fetus death from flu release,\" read the picture. The CDC failed to inform pregnant mothers of the increase (as is the case) in abortion and stillbirth opportunities after receiving the vaccine recommended by the CDC. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, Instagram's parent company.) He has over 1700 like, and PolityFact found several copies of the article elsewhere on the Internet. As evidence of its claim, the Comprehensive Health Company is more connected to a site called VacTruth.com, a well-known publisher of misleading anti-immunisation information. The site requires a password to enter, so we couldn't locate the article in question. The Comprehensive Health Organization (WHO) did not respond to further information for a letter requesting further evidence. One study found a rise in \"auto-abortion\" or abortion, among women vaccinated by influenza - but most research found no link between vaccine and infant mortality. More importantly, medical officials continue to recommend that pregnant women obtain influenza shots because they can be more vulnerable to serious influenza-related diseases, as can their children. The article came from us following Instagram's article to enter the vaccine control blog from November 2016. The Code, \"Healthy Freedom,\" is part of a liberal movement that opposes health systems and advocates for non-traditional care. The publication of the Code is linked to a 2013 study published by the Human Toxicology and Experimental Journal. It considered the cases of abortion and stillbirths included in the system for reporting incidents with vaccines, a database on the reported side effects of vaccines maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. Relevant: No, you are not \"activist, live virus walking\" for two weeks after the flu shot. The study found an increase in \"feminine loss reports\" among pregnant women who received the flu dose during two consecutive seasons, from 2008 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2010. (The season usually extends from autumn to spring.) Some 587,600 pregnant women were vaccinated with regular flu shots in 2008-2009 and some 2,236,000 pregnant women were vaccinated with regular influenza shots and/or pig flu vaccine next year. The study noted a jump in foetal loss reports from four in 2008-2009 to 174 in 2009-2010. This is an increase of 4,250 percent - but that doesn't mean you have to explain it like this blogger did. The researchers did not prove that the influenza injection was the cause of the rise. The CDC has several limitations on these data. The reason why it cannot be relied upon is to encourage health-care providers to report any health problems after the introduction of vaccines - even though they do not believe that the vaccine is the cause. The Gateway Pundit on 20 January 2021 states in an article that \"the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes its extreme over-testing of individuals for positive tests for COVID.\" By Noah Y. Kim on 22 January 2021, \"Reports may contain incomplete, inaccurate, accidental, and unverified information,\" as stated in the CDC's list of restrictions. \"The number of reports alone cannot be explained or used to draw conclusions on the existence, severity, frequency or rate of vaccine-related problems.\" The experts agreed to these limitations. \"The study you mention tries to do something with the data of the VAERS that isn't true,\" said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, in an e-mail. \"The results of this study do not contribute to our scientific understanding of the issue.\" The studies cited by Instagram are not the only ones linking influenza injections to abortions. However, most research shows that the vaccine is safe, and the CDC recommends it for all pregnant women to avoid the complications caused by flu injuries. A study published in the magazine Vaccines in September 2017 compared approximately 500 pregnant women who had had an abortion during the 2010/11 and 2012 flu seasons with the same number of women born naturally during the same period. The researchers found that 17 of the women who had had an abortion had given flu shots within a month of malfeasance and had also obtained the vaccine in the previous year. However, the authors cautioned that the results did not indicate a causal link between influenza vaccine and abortion - yet they said that pregnant women should receive influenza injection. The CDC also questions the results of the study on its website. The CDC states that most research supports the idea that influenza injection is safe for pregnant women and that the risk of abortion is low. The report cites several studies that found no increase in the likelihood of abortion as a result of the receipt of influenza injection. \u2022 A study in 2013 published in the magazine Obstetrics and Gynaecology found no increased risk of pregnancy loss within four weeks of receiving the influenza vaccine. \u2022 A study published in Paediatrics magazine in 2014 found that influenza vaccine did not increase the risk of \"early birth\" or decrease among 57,554 vaccinating or non-enriched women. \u2022 A 2017 review of reports submitted to the VAR system between 2010 and 2016 found no evidence of a link between influenza vaccine and pregnancy complications. \u2022 A study conducted in 2017 concluded that even when the influenza vaccine was given during the first three months of pregnancy, the vaccine was not associated with congenital defects. In addition to the Centre for Disease Control, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also recommends that pregnant women receive influenza injection. \"When assessing all available scientific information, there is insufficient information to support a change in the current recommendation to introduce and promote routine influenza vaccination during pregnancy regardless of pregnancy,\" Haywood Brown, former President of the Professional Association, wrote in September 2017. Our Instagram Governor's article claimed that there was a 250.0% increase in foetal deaths due to influenza injection. This allegation can be attributed to a 2013 study that found an increase in foetal mortality among pregnant women between two consecutive flu seasons. However, the CDC and experts say that the method of data collection was problematic. Most of the research shows that there is no link between abortion and the flu shot, and the Center for Disease Control and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend that all pregnant women obtain the vaccine.
