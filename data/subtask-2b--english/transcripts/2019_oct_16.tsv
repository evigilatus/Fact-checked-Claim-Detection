1	Anderson Cooper	It’s the CNN, New York Times Democratic presidential debate.
2	Anderson Cooper	We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and watching around the world, watching us on CNN, CNN International, CNN Espanol, cnn.com, thenewyorktimes.com CNN, CNN’s Facebook page, and listening on the Westworld One Radio Network, Sirius XM satellite radio, NPR, and the American Forces Network.
3	Anderson Cooper	I’m Anderson Cooper moderating tonight’s debate along with CNN’s Erin Burnett and New York Times national editor, Marc Lacey.
4	Anderson Cooper	We are in Ohio tonight because it’s one of the most critical battleground states.
5	Anderson Cooper	Ohio has backed all but two presidential winners in every election since 1896.
6	Erin Burnett	The top 12 democratic presidential candidates are at their positions behind the podiums.
7	Erin Burnett	This is a record number of candidates for a presidential primary debate.
8	Erin Burnett	So to accommodate the large group, there are no opening statements tonight.
9	Marc Lacey	Before we begin a reminder of the ground rules, you’ll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications.
10	Marc Lacey	Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates as that will count against your time.
11	Anderson Cooper	And we remind our audience here in the Rike Center at Otterbein to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and each other.
12	Anderson Cooper	All right, let’s begin.
13	Anderson Cooper	Since the last debate House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.
14	Anderson Cooper	Senator Warren, I want to start with you.
15	Anderson Cooper	You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office.
16	Anderson Cooper	But the question is with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?
17	Senator Warren	Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics.
18	Senator Warren	And I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.
19	Senator Warren	When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment, but when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages.
20	Senator Warren	And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown to a fare thee well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly.
21	Senator Warren	And so at that moment I called for opening an impeachment inquiry.
22	Senator Warren	Now that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result, Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.
23	Senator Warren	You know, we took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law and that includes the President of the United States.
24	Senator Warren	Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences.
25	Senator Warren	This is about Donald Trump, but understand it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country.
26	Senator Warren	The impeachment must go forward.
27	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Senator Warren.
28	Anderson Cooper	You’re all going to get in on this by the way.
29	Anderson Cooper	Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach President Trump?
30	Anderson Cooper	Please respond.
31	Bernie Sanders	No they don’t.
32	Bernie Sanders	In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country.
33	Bernie Sanders	It’s not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller report.
34	Bernie Sanders	I think that the House will find him guilty of worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause.
35	Bernie Sanders	This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that and that is outrageous.
36	Bernie Sanders	And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a President of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension.
37	Bernie Sanders	So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.
38	Anderson Cooper	Vice President Biden, during the Clinton impeachment proceedings you said, and I quote, “The American people don’t think that they’ve made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision.” With the country now split, have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump?
39	Joe Biden	Yes, they have.
40	Joe Biden	I said from the beginning that if in fact Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report.
41	Joe Biden	If they did that, they would have no choice, no choice, but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.
42	Joe Biden	This president and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders, is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history.
43	Joe Biden	And the fact is that this President of United States has gone so far as to say since this latest event that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment.
44	Joe Biden	They have no choice but to move.
45	Anderson Cooper	Senator Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that members of Congress have to be in her words, “fair to the President and give him a chance to exonerate himself.” You’ve already said that based on everything you’ve seen, you would vote to remove him from office.
46	Anderson Cooper	Is that being fair to the President?
47	Kamala Harris	Well, it’s just being observant because he has committed crimes in plain sight.
48	Kamala Harris	I mean, it’s shocking, but he told us who he was.
49	Kamala Harris	Maya Angelou who told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time.
50	Kamala Harris	During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it.
51	Kamala Harris	And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people.
52	Kamala Harris	He’s been selling out working people.
53	Kamala Harris	He’s been selling out our values, he’s been selling out national security and on this issue with Ukraine, he’s been selling out our democracy.
54	Kamala Harris	Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president.
55	Kamala Harris	And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances.
56	Kamala Harris	This is one of those moments.
57	Kamala Harris	And so Congress must ask but the reality of it is that I don’t really think this impeachment process is going to take very long because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it.
58	Kamala Harris	And and he did it in plain sight.
59	Kamala Harris	He has given us the evidence and he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server and there has been a clear consciousness of guilt.
60	Kamala Harris	This will not take very long.
61	Kamala Harris	Donald Trump needs to be held accountable.
62	Kamala Harris	He is indeed the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.
63	Anderson Cooper	Senator Booker, you have said that president Trump’s “moral vandalism disqualifies him from being president.” Can you be fair in an impeachment trial?
64	Anderson Cooper	Please respond.
65	Senator Booker	So first of all, we must be fair.
66	Senator Booker	We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office.
67	Senator Booker	This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship.
68	Senator Booker	Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage.
69	Senator Booker	I understand the outrage that we all feel, but we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn’t rip us apart.
70	Senator Booker	Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus.
71	Senator Booker	That’s what this nation needs in what is a moral moment and not a political one.
72	Senator Booker	So I swore an oath to do my job as a Senator, do my duty.
73	Senator Booker	This president has violated his, I will do mine.
74	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Senator Booker.
75	Anderson Cooper	Senator Klobuchar, what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact people’s day to day lives, healthcare, the economy and could backfire on Democrats.
76	Amy Klobuchar	We can do two things at once, that’s our job.
77	Amy Klobuchar	We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America because this President has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.
78	Amy Klobuchar	He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio.
79	Amy Klobuchar	He’s not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa.
80	Amy Klobuchar	And I take this even a step further.
81	Amy Klobuchar	You know when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he’s digging up dirt on an opponent, that’s illegal conduct.
82	Amy Klobuchar	That’s what he was doing.
83	Amy Klobuchar	He didn’t talk to them about the Russian invasion, he talked to him about that.
84	Amy Klobuchar	So I’m still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again.
85	Amy Klobuchar	I’d like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again.
86	Amy Klobuchar	And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again.
87	Amy Klobuchar	It doesn’t make America great again, it makes Russia great again.
88	Amy Klobuchar	And that is what this President has done.
89	Amy Klobuchar	So whether it is worker’s issues, whether it is farmer’s issue, he has put his own private interests and I will not do that.
90	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
91	Anderson Cooper	Secretary Castro, is impeachment of distraction?
92	Julian Castro	Not at all.
93	Julian Castro	We can walk and chew gum at the same time and all of us are out there every single day talking about what we’re going to do to make sure that more people cross the graduation stage, that more families have great healthcare, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises.
94	Julian Castro	Because Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.
95	Julian Castro	Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller report point out 10 different instances where the President obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is ongoingly, in an ongoing way, violating his oath of office and abusing his power.
96	Julian Castro	We have to impeach this President and the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal, he should be removed.
97	Anderson Cooper	Mayor Buttigieg, you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan.
98	Anderson Cooper	There’s been obviously very little Republican support to date, yet Democrats are proceeding.
99	Anderson Cooper	Is that a mistake?
100	Pete Buttigieg	Well, it’s a mistake on the part of Republicans who enabled a president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share.
101	Pete Buttigieg	Look, the President has left the Congress with no choice and this is not just about holding the President accountable for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television.
102	Pete Buttigieg	It’s also about the presidency itself because a president, 10 years or 100 years from now, will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion, either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.
103	Pete Buttigieg	But everyone on this stage by definition is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency.
104	Pete Buttigieg	Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end.
105	Pete Buttigieg	I want you to picture what it’s going to be like, what it’s actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president.
106	Pete Buttigieg	It starts out feeling like a happy thought.
107	Pete Buttigieg	This particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over, but really think about where we’ll be, vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.
108	Pete Buttigieg	And these big issues, from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process.
109	Pete Buttigieg	I’m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.
110	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Congresswoman Gabbard, you’re the only sitting House member on this stage, how do you respond?
111	Tulsi Gabbard	If impeachment is driven by these hyper-partisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country.
112	Tulsi Gabbard	Unfortunately, this is what we’ve already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election.
113	Tulsi Gabbard	And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016.
114	Tulsi Gabbard	The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House and I think that it should continue to play its course out together.
115	Tulsi Gabbard	All the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward.
116	Tulsi Gabbard	If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.
117	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Congresswoman.
118	Anderson Cooper	Mr. Steyer, you’ve been calling for impeachment for two years, does there need to be bipartisan support?
119	Tom Steyer	Well, Anderson, this is my first time on this stage, so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.
120	Tom Steyer	But I also want to point out that Anderson’s right, two years ago, I started the Need To Impeach movement because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
121	Tom Steyer	That we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency.
122	Tom Steyer	So in fact, impeaching and removing this President is something that the American people are demanding.
123	Tom Steyer	They’re the voice that counts and that’s who I went to, the American people.
124	Anderson Cooper	Mr. Yang, do you think there’s already enough evidence out there to impeach the President?
125	Anderson Cooper	Please respond.
126	Andrew Yang	I support impeachment, but we shouldn’t have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will one be successful or two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016.
127	Andrew Yang	We’re standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state.
128	Andrew Yang	Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points?
129	Andrew Yang	Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns and we’re not stopping there.
130	Andrew Yang	How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio?
131	Andrew Yang	Raise your hands.
132	Andrew Yang	It’s not just you, Amazon alone as closing 30% of America’s stores in malls soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes.
133	Andrew Yang	These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution and that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office.
134	Andrew Yang	The fact is, Donald Trump, when we’re talking about him, we are losing.
135	Andrew Yang	We need to present a new vision and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump.
136	Anderson Cooper	Congressman O’Rourke, on impeachment, please respond.
137	Beto O’Rourke	You know, I think about everyone who’s ever served this country in uniform.
138	Beto O’Rourke	We have two examples here on the stage tonight, Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard.
139	Beto O’Rourke	Those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our constitution.
140	Beto O’Rourke	We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice and we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this President’s criminality and his lawlessness.
141	Beto O’Rourke	The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy.
142	Beto O’Rourke	As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation.
143	Beto O’Rourke	Then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.
144	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Congressman.
145	Beto O’Rourke	If you do not hold them to account, if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment, our constitution and our country, we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line and we cannot do that.
146	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Congressman.
147	Anderson Cooper	The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump’s attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son Hunter.
148	Anderson Cooper	Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine.
149	Anderson Cooper	I want to point out there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you.
150	Anderson Cooper	Having said that on Sunday, you announced that if you’re president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses.
151	Anderson Cooper	My question is, if it’s not okay for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president, Vice President Biden?
152	Joe Biden	Look, my son did nothing wrong.
153	Joe Biden	I did nothing wrong.
154	Joe Biden	I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.
155	Joe Biden	And that’s what we should be focusing on.
156	Joe Biden	And what I wanted to make a point about and my son’s statement speaks for itself, he spoke about it today.
157	Joe Biden	My son’s statement speaks for itself.
158	Joe Biden	What I think is important is we focus on why it’s so important to remove this man from office.
159	Joe Biden	On the 17th … look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president, that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections.
160	Joe Biden	It was the greatest threat to America.
161	Joe Biden	This president on three occasions, three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections.
162	Joe Biden	The fact is that it is outrageous.
163	Joe Biden	Rudy Giuliani, the President and his thugs have already proven that they in fact are flat lying.
164	Joe Biden	What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump.
165	Joe Biden	He doesn’t want me to be the candidate.
166	Joe Biden	He’s going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.
167	Anderson Cooper	Hold on, I’m sorry.
168	Anderson Cooper	I just want follow up.
169	Anderson Cooper	Mr. Vice President, as you’ve said to your son, Hunter today gave an interview.
170	Anderson Cooper	He admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgment by serving on that board in Ukraine.
171	Anderson Cooper	Did you make a mistake by letting him, you were the point person on Ukraine at the time?
172	Anderson Cooper	If you can answer.
173	Joe Biden	Look, my son’s statement speaks for itself.
174	Joe Biden	I did my job, I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine.
175	Joe Biden	No one has indicated I have.
176	Joe Biden	We’ve always kept everything separate.
177	Joe Biden	Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed any, so there’d be no potential conflict.
178	Joe Biden	My son made a judgment.
179	Joe Biden	I’m proud of the judgment he made.
180	Joe Biden	I’m proud of what he had to say and let’s focus on this, the fact of the matter is that this is about Trump’s corruption.
181	Joe Biden	That’s what we should be focusing on.
182	Anderson Cooper	Senator Sanders, your response.
183	Bernie Sanders	Let me make a point.
184	Bernie Sanders	I think that it is absolutely imperative to go forward with impeachment.
185	Bernie Sanders	I hope that he is impeached.
186	Bernie Sanders	But I think what would be a disaster if the American people believed that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under insured.
187	Bernie Sanders	We’re forgetting about the existential threat of climate change.
188	Bernie Sanders	We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.
189	Bernie Sanders	So what we have got to do is end this corruption set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way.
190	Bernie Sanders	But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.
191	Anderson Cooper	Senator Sanders, thank you, Mark.
192	Marc Lacey	We want to move now now to the economy, Senator Warren, [crosstalk 00:19:22] You’ve proposed some sweeping plans, free public college … [crosstalk 00:19:26] Thank you.
193	Senator Booker	It is wrong to move on.
194	Marc Lacey	Senator Warren, you’ve proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal child care, eliminating most Americans college debt, and you’ve said how you’re going to pay for those plans, but you have not specified how you’re going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for All.
195	Marc Lacey	Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?
196	Senator Warren	So I have made clear what my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hardworking, middle class families, costs will go down.
197	Senator Warren	You know, the way I see this is I have been out all around this country.
198	Senator Warren	I’ve done 140 town halls now.
199	Senator Warren	Been to 27 States and Puerto Rico, shoot, I have done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy.
200	Senator Warren	And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly.
201	Senator Warren	So I’ve talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter’s been diagnosed with cancer.
202	Senator Warren	I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes.
203	Senator Warren	I’ve talked to the young man who has M.S.
204	Senator Warren	And here’s the thing about all of them, they all had great health insurance right at the beginning.
205	Senator Warren	But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.
206	Senator Warren	Look, the way I see this, it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer.
207	Senator Warren	To think about the changes in your family, if your mom’s got diabetes or what it means for your life going forward if you’ve been diagnosed with M.S.
208	Senator Warren	But what you shouldn’t have to worry about is how you’re going to pay for your healthcare after that.
209	Marc Lacey	Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All.
210	Marc Lacey	You’ve endorsed his plan.
211	Marc Lacey	Should you acknowledge it too?
212	Senator Warren	So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle class families are going to face.
213	Senator Warren	So let me be clear on this.
214	Senator Warren	Costs will go up for the wealthy, they will go up for big corporations and for middle class families, they will go down.
215	Senator Warren	I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.
216	Marc Lacey	Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been “evasive” about how she’s going to pay for Medicare for All.
217	Marc Lacey	What’s your response?
218	Pete Buttigieg	Well, we heard it tonight.
219	Pete Buttigieg	A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer.
220	Pete Buttigieg	This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.
221	Pete Buttigieg	Your signature Senator, is to have a plan for everything except this, no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.
222	Pete Buttigieg	And the thing is we really can deliver healthcare for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself.
223	Pete Buttigieg	But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes or no question is Medicare for All who want it.
224	Pete Buttigieg	We take a version of Medicare, we let you access it if you want to.
225	Pete Buttigieg	And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that too.
226	Pete Buttigieg	That is what most Americans want.
227	Pete Buttigieg	Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your healthcare and for your family.
228	Pete Buttigieg	And it can be delivered without [crosstalk 00:23:00]
229	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Mayor.
230	Marc Lacey	Senator, your response.
231	Senator Warren	So let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term Medicare for All who want it, understand what that really means.
232	Senator Warren	It’s Medicare for All who can afford it, and that’s the problem we’ve got.
233	Senator Warren	Medicare for All is the gold standard.
234	Senator Warren	It is the way we get healthcare coverage for every single American, including the family whose child’s been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who’s just gotten an M.S.
235	Senator Warren	diagnosis.
236	Senator Warren	That’s how we make sure that everyone gets healthcare.
237	Senator Warren	We can pay for this, I’ve laid out the basic principles.
238	Senator Warren	Costs are going to go up for the wealthy, they’re going to go up for big corporations.
239	Senator Warren	They will not go up for middle class families and I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs because costs are what people care about.
240	Senator Warren	I’ve been studying this for the biggest part of my life, why people go bankrupt.
241	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator, can the mayor respond?
242	Senator Warren	Sure.
243	Pete Buttigieg	I don’t think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice and the choice of Medicare for All who want it, which is affordable for everyone because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that healthcare.
244	Pete Buttigieg	It’s just better than Medicare for All whether you want it or not.
245	Pete Buttigieg	And I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years, when we could achieve that same big bold goal.
246	Pete Buttigieg	And once again, we’re competing to be president for the day after Trump.
247	Pete Buttigieg	Our country will be horrifyingly polarized even more than now.
248	Pete Buttigieg	After everything we’ve been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided.
249	Pete Buttigieg	Why unnecessarily divide this country over healthcare when there’s a better way to deliver coverage for all.
250	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Mayor, Senator Sanders.
251	Senator Warren	I’d like to be able to respond-
252	Bernie Sanders	As somebody who wrote the damn bill as I said.
253	Bernie Sanders	Let’s be clear on the Medicare for All bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone.
254	Bernie Sanders	All out of pocket expenses are gone.
255	Bernie Sanders	We’re going to do better than the Canadian’s doing, that is what they have managed to do.
256	Bernie Sanders	At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their healthcare bills.
257	Bernie Sanders	But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.
258	Bernie Sanders	They’re going to go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less, substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out of pocket expenses.
259	Marc Lacey	[crosstalk 00:25:42] Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the Senator just said about taxes going up?
260	Senator Warren	My view on this and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking middle class families.
261	Senator Warren	I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for All who can afford it, that will leave behind millions of people who cannot.
262	Senator Warren	And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, “Sorry, we’re not covering your expensive cancer treatments.
263	Senator Warren	We’re not covering your expensive treatments for M.S.
264	Senator Warren	We’re not covering what covering what you need.”
265	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
266	Marc Lacey	Senator Klobuchar.
267	Amy Klobuchar	At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up and I’m sorry Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.
268	Amy Klobuchar	I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and that’s have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies.
269	Amy Klobuchar	That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in four years.
270	Amy Klobuchar	And I’m tired of hearing whenever I say these things, “Oh, it’s Republican talking points.” You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that’s going to do that.
271	Amy Klobuchar	I think there is a better way that is bold that will cover more people and it’s the one we should get behind.
272	Marc Lacey	Senator Warren.
273	Senator Warren	Yeah, I didn’t spend most of my time in Washington.
274	Senator Warren	I spent most of my time studying one basic question and that is why hardworking people go broke.
275	Senator Warren	And one of the principle reasons for that is the cost of healthcare.
276	Senator Warren	And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance.
277	Senator Warren	The problem we’ve got right now is the overall cost of healthcare.
278	Senator Warren	And look, you can try to spin this any way you want.
279	Senator Warren	I’ve spent my entire life on working on how America’s middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back.
280	Senator Warren	I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works.
281	Senator Warren	And a part of that is we’ve got stop Americans from going bankrupt over healthcare costs.
282	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
283	Marc Lacey	Senator Klobuchar, do you want to respond?
284	Amy Klobuchar	Yes I do and I appreciate Elizabeth’s work.
285	Amy Klobuchar	But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done and we can get this public option done and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices.
286	Amy Klobuchar	But what really bothers me about this discussion, which we’ve had so many times, is that we don’t talk about the things that I’m hearing about from regular Americans that is longterm care.
287	Amy Klobuchar	We are seeing, I once called it a silver tsunami, the aging, and then someone told me that was too negative.
288	Amy Klobuchar	So I call it the silver surge, the aging of the population.
289	Amy Klobuchar	We need to make it easier to get longterm care insurance and strengthen Medicaid.
290	Amy Klobuchar	In this state, the state of Ohio that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed.
291	Amy Klobuchar	Those are the issues that I hear about when I’m in Toledo [crosstalk 00:29:07]
292	Marc Lacey	Let me bring you in here, Vice President, for your response.
293	Marc Lacey	Are Senators Warren and Sanders being realistic about the difficulty of enacting their plans?
294	Joe Biden	First of all, the plan we’re hearing discussed is the Biden plan, the one I put forward, build on Obamacare, at public option.
295	Joe Biden	We can go into that, I can talk about that if you’d like.
296	Joe Biden	But here’s the deal, on the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it’s awfully important to be straightforward with them.
297	Joe Biden	The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years.
298	Joe Biden	That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how we’re going to pay for it.
299	Joe Biden	The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs, but for people making between $50 and $75,000 year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is they’ll pay more in new taxes, 7.4% plus or 5% plus a 4% income tax.
300	Joe Biden	If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making 100,000 bucks a year, their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand.
301	Joe Biden	That is more than they will possibly say on this healthcare plan.
302	Joe Biden	We have a plan put forward that will work.
303	Marc Lacey	Senator Sanders, do you want to respond to that?
304	Bernie Sanders	I get a little bit tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel.
305	Bernie Sanders	87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt.
306	Bernie Sanders	For what reason, they came down with cancer.
307	Bernie Sanders	I will tell you what the issue is here.
308	Bernie Sanders	The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the healthcare industry, which made $100 billion in profit.
309	Bernie Sanders	Whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt price fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
310	Bernie Sanders	And if we don’t have the guts to do that, if all we could do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.
311	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
312	Marc Lacey	Senator Harris, your response.
313	Kamala Harris	This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word with all of these discussions about healthcare on women’s access to reproductive healthcare, which it’s under full on attack in America today, and it’s outrageous.
314	Kamala Harris	There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare.
315	Kamala Harris	And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.
316	Kamala Harris	Women are the majority of the population in this country.
317	Kamala Harris	People need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the-
318	Kamala Harris	… country, people need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.
319	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
320	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
321	Kamala Harris	Let’s talk about that.
322	Kamala Harris	That is a significant healthcare issue in America today.
323	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
324	Erin Burnett	I want to turn now to jobs.
325	Erin Burnett	According to a recent study, about a quarter of American jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years.
326	Erin Burnett	Ohio is one of the states likely to be hardest hit.
327	Erin Burnett	Senator Sanders, you say your federal jobs guarantee is part of the answer to the threat from automation, but tens of millions of Americans could end up losing their jobs.
328	Erin Burnett	Are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those Americans?
329	Bernie Sanders	Damn right, we will, and I’ll tell you why.
330	Bernie Sanders	If you look up what goes on in America today, we have an infrastructure which is collapsing.
331	Bernie Sanders	We can put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, et cetera.
332	Bernie Sanders	Furthermore, and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight, this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change, and the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
333	Bernie Sanders	We need workers to do childcare.
334	Bernie Sanders	We need workers, great teachers to come in to school systems which don’t have the teachers that we need right now.
335	Bernie Sanders	We need more doctors, we need more dentists, we need more carpenters, we need more sheet metal metalworkers.
336	Bernie Sanders	When we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition-free and canceling student debt, we’re going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs.
337	Erin Burnett	Senator Sanders, thank you.
338	Erin Burnett	Mr. Yang, your main solution to job loss from automation is a universal basic income.
339	Erin Burnett	Why is giving people $1,000 a month better than Sanders’ plan guaranteeing them a job?
340	Andrew Yang	I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice.
341	Andrew Yang	What are the jobs?
342	Andrew Yang	Who manages you?
343	Andrew Yang	What if you don’t like your job?
344	Andrew Yang	What if you’re not good at your job?
345	Andrew Yang	The fact is, most Americans do not want to work for the federal government and saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century, to me, is not a vision that most Americans would embrace.
346	Andrew Yang	Also, Senator Sanders’ description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, who’s at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic.
347	Andrew Yang	We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month.
348	Andrew Yang	It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities.
349	Andrew Yang	It helps all Americans transition, because the fact is, and you know this in Ohio, if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.
350	Andrew Yang	When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up.
351	Andrew Yang	It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do.
352	Andrew Yang	This is the sort of positive vision in response to the Fourth Industrial Revolution that we have to embrace as a party.
353	Erin Burnett	Senator Booker, a federal jobs guarantee or $1,000 a month?
354	Erin Burnett	Are those the best solutions there?
355	Erin Burnett	Please respond.
356	Senator Booker	Well, first of all, I’m happy to get in, finally.
357	Senator Booker	I just want to say, as a great New Jerseyan, Yogi Berra, said, “I am having deja vu all over again.” I’m having days of Google all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 2016’s election.
358	Senator Booker	We are literally using Donald Trump’s lies, and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman.
359	Senator Booker	That was so offensive.
360	Senator Booker	He should not have to defend ourselves.
361	Senator Booker	The only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump, seeing that we’re distracting from his malfeasance and the selling out of his office.
362	Senator Booker	I’m having deja vu all over again because we have another healthcare debate and we’re not talking about the clear and existential threat in America that we’re in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close.
363	Senator Booker	We are seeing, all over this country, women’s reproductive rights under attack.
364	Senator Booker	God bless Kamala, but you know what?
365	Senator Booker	Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.
366	Senator Booker	Men-
367	Erin Burnett	Thank you.
368	Senator Booker	-it is not just because women are our daughters-
369	Erin Burnett	Senator.
370	Senator Booker	-and our friends and our wives.
371	Senator Booker	It’s because women are people and people deserve to control their own body.
372	Erin Burnett	Senator, thank you.
373	Erin Burnett	We are going to get to that issue later on tonight.
374	Erin Burnett	Senator Warren, you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is “a good story, except it’s not really true.” Should workers here in Ohio not be worried about losing their jobs to automation?
375	Senator Warren	The data show that we’ve had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principle reason has been bad trade policy.
376	Senator Warren	The principle reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who have been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America.
377	Senator Warren	They have no loyalty to American workers.
378	Senator Warren	They have no loyalty to American consumers.
379	Senator Warren	They have no loyalty to American communities.
380	Senator Warren	They are loyal only to their own bottom line.
381	Senator Warren	I have a plan to fix that, and it’s accountable capitalism.
382	Senator Warren	It says, “You want to have one of the giant corporations in America?
383	Senator Warren	Then, by golly, 40% of your board of directors should be elected by your employees.” That’ll make a difference.
384	Senator Warren	When a corporation decides, “Gee, we can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico,” when there are people on the board in the board room saying, “No.
385	Senator Warren	Do you know what that does to our company?
386	Senator Warren	Do you know what that does to our community, what it does to our workers?” We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate.
387	Senator Warren	We need to restructure strength in this economy and that’s where it starts.
388	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator.
389	Erin Burnett	Secretary Castro.
390	Erin Burnett	What’s your response to Senator Warren’s claim that automation is a good story, except it’s not really true?
391	Julian Castro	Well, I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right?
392	Julian Castro	Yeah, I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation.
393	Julian Castro	I’m even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work, but I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country.
394	Julian Castro	As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest job data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump.
395	Julian Castro	He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest.
396	Julian Castro	I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work.
397	Julian Castro	I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy.
398	Julian Castro	I was in Newton, Iowa a few weeks ago and I visited a place called TPI.
399	Julian Castro	Newton, Iowa had a Maytag washing machine manufacturing facility, and then it closed down.
400	Julian Castro	TPI manufacturers wind turbines.
401	Julian Castro	They’re putting hundreds of people to work at decent paying jobs and creating a better future for those families.
402	Julian Castro	On top of that, let me just say this, we need to support working families.
403	Julian Castro	We need to invest in things like universal childcare-
404	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
405	Julian Castro	-so that people can afford childcare instead of having to pay 20% of their income for it.
406	Andrew Yang	Senator Warren.
407	Andrew Yang	I just need to address this.
408	Andrew Yang	Senator Warren, I’ve been talking-
409	Erin Burnett	Go ahead, Mr. Yang.
410	Andrew Yang	-to Americans around the country about automation, and they’re smart.
411	Andrew Yang	They see what’s happening around them.
412	Andrew Yang	Their Main Street stores are closing.
413	Andrew Yang	They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonald’s, every grocery store, every CVS.
414	Andrew Yang	Driving a truck as the most common job in 29 States, including this one.
415	Andrew Yang	Three and a half million truck drivers in this country, and my friends in California are piloting self driving trucks.
416	Andrew Yang	What does that going to mean for the three and a half million truckers or the seven million Americans who work in truck stops, motels, and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal?
417	Andrew Yang	Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.
418	Erin Burnett	Senator Warren, respond please.
419	Pete Buttigieg	This is exactly what I said.
420	Senator Warren	I understand that what we’re all looking for is how we strengthen America’s middle class.
421	Senator Warren	Actually, I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security.
422	Senator Warren	It’s one of the reasons that I put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now.
423	Senator Warren	That $200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty and it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more.
424	Senator Warren	It also has a provision for your wife, for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors, and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their Social Security.
425	Erin Burnett	Thank you.
426	Senator Warren	So after a lifetime of hard work, people are entitled to retire with dignity.
427	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator Warren.
428	Senator Warren	I see this is an important question, but I want to understand the data on this.
429	Erin Burnett	Senator, thank you very much.
430	Senator Warren	I want to make sure we’re responding to make this work.
431	Erin Burnett	Your time is up.
432	Andrew Yang	I have the data.
433	Erin Burnett	I want to give Congresswoman Gabbard a chance to respond.
434	Tulsi Gabbard	Thank you.
435	Tulsi Gabbard	You know, really what this is about is getting to the heart of the fear that is well founded.
436	Tulsi Gabbard	As people look to this automation revolution, they look to uncertainty.
437	Tulsi Gabbard	They don’t know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives.
438	Tulsi Gabbard	I agree with my friend Andrew Yang.
439	Tulsi Gabbard	I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see.
440	Tulsi Gabbard	This has to do with bad trade deals that we’ve seen in the past, that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families.
441	Tulsi Gabbard	Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people.
442	Tulsi Gabbard	I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that.
443	Tulsi Gabbard	The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have, but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we can’t forget that.
444	Erin Burnett	Thank you very much.
445	Marc Lacey	One of the industries most at risk from a changing economy is the auto industry.
446	Marc Lacey	General Motors used to be the largest employer in Ohio.
447	Marc Lacey	Now it’s 72nd.
448	Marc Lacey	Today, thousands of GM workers here in Ohio and across the country are on strike.
449	Marc Lacey	All of you on the stage have voiced support for these workers.
450	Marc Lacey	Senator Booker, one of the latest impasses in negotiations involves bringing jobs back from Mexico.
451	Marc Lacey	As president, how would you convince GM to return production to the United States?
452	Senator Booker	Well, first of all, the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation, and I hope that my friend Andrew Yang will come out for this… Doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
453	Senator Booker	It would put more money in people’s pockets than giving them $1,000 a month.
454	Senator Booker	We have to start putting the dignity back in work.
455	Senator Booker	Number one, you start having trade deals.
456	Senator Booker	Not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn’t put workers at the center of every trade deal.
457	Senator Booker	We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country, but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed.
458	Senator Booker	But it’s more than that.
459	Senator Booker	I stood with these workers because we’re seeing this trend all over our country.
460	Senator Booker	I stood with unions because right now, unions in America are under attack.
461	Senator Booker	As union membership has gone down, we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country.
462	Senator Booker	So the other thing that I’ll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectorial bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers’ conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country.
463	Marc Lacey	Thank you.
464	Marc Lacey	Senator.
465	Marc Lacey	Congressman O’Rourke, same question for you.
466	Marc Lacey	How would you convince GM to bring production back to the United States from Mexico?
467	Beto O’Rourke	I’ve met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance, paying effectively zero in taxes last year.
468	Beto O’Rourke	The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there, what they want is a shot.
469	Beto O’Rourke	They want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today.
470	Beto O’Rourke	Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today.
471	Beto O’Rourke	Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage.
472	Beto O’Rourke	If we compliment that with investment in world-class pre K through 12 public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country and create more than five million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot.
473	Beto O’Rourke	They don’t want a handout, they don’t want a job guarantee.
474	Beto O’Rourke	They just want a shot, and as president, I will give them that shot.
475	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Congressman.
476	Erin Burnett	Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.
477	Erin Burnett	The top 1% now own more of this nation’s wealth than the bottom 90% combined.
478	Erin Burnett	Senator Sanders, when you introduced your wealth tax, which would tax the assets of the wealthiest Americans, you said, quoting you, Senator, ” Billionaires should not exist.” Is the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence?
479	Bernie Sanders	When you have a half a million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 million people uninsured or under-insured, when you’ve got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt, and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage.
480	Bernie Sanders	The truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality and we cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years.
481	Bernie Sanders	If you are asking me, do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying… the wealthiest, top one-tenth of 1%… start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us?
482	Bernie Sanders	Yes, that’s exactly what I believe.
483	Erin Burnett	Thank you.
484	Erin Burnett	Senator.
485	Erin Burnett	Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.
486	Tom Steyer	Ha.
487	Erin Burnett	What’s your plan for closing the income gap?
488	Tom Steyer	Well, first of all, let me say this.
489	Tom Steyer	Senator Sanders is right.
490	Tom Steyer	There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people, and specifically on organized labor.
491	Tom Steyer	The results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income.
492	Tom Steyer	It’s absolutely wrong.
493	Tom Steyer	It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair.
494	Tom Steyer	I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax.
495	Tom Steyer	I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations.
496	Tom Steyer	But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings.
497	Tom Steyer	As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise.
498	Tom Steyer	90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.
499	Tom Steyer	If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks.
500	Tom Steyer	It’s seven and a quarter.
501	Tom Steyer	If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it’d be over 20 bucks.
502	Tom Steyer	There’s something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government.
503	Tom Steyer	Our government has failed.
504	Tom Steyer	That’s why I’m running for president, because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants… healthcare, education, Green New Deal, or a living wage-
505	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
506	Tom Steyer	-unless we break the power of these corporations.
507	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
508	Erin Burnett	Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people.
509	Erin Burnett	Do you believe that Senator Sanders’ and Senator Warren’s wealth tax plans do that?
510	Joe Biden	No, look.
511	Joe Biden	Demonizing wealthy people.
512	Joe Biden	What I talked about is how you get things done.
513	Joe Biden	The way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now.
514	Joe Biden	We have to start rewarding work, not just wealth.
515	Joe Biden	I would eliminate the capital gains tax that… I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5%.
516	Joe Biden	I would double it, because guess what?
517	Joe Biden	Why in God’s name should someone who’s clipping coupons in the stock market make… in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is… like I said, a school teacher and a firefighter.
518	Joe Biden	It’s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax.
519	Joe Biden	Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are there’s $1 trillion, $640 billion in tax loopholes.
520	Joe Biden	You can’t justify a minimum $600 billion of that.
521	Joe Biden	We can eliminate it all.
522	Joe Biden	I could go into detail, had I the time.
523	Joe Biden	Thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy.
524	Joe Biden	We’re going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not.
525	Joe Biden	This is one of the reasons why these debates kind of crazy.
526	Joe Biden	Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given.
527	Joe Biden	The fact is, everybody’s right about the fact that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is costing jobs.
528	Joe Biden	It is.
529	Joe Biden	The fact is also corporate greed.
530	Joe Biden	If they’re going back, they’re not investing in their employees.
531	Joe Biden	They’re reinvesting and buying back their stock.
532	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
533	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
534	Joe Biden	See, I’m doing the same thing.
535	Erin Burnett	Senator Warren, your response.
536	Senator Warren	I think this is about our values as a country.
537	Senator Warren	Show me your budget, show me your tax plans, and we’ll know what your values are.
538	Senator Warren	Right now in America, the top one tenth of 1% have so much wealth, understand this, that if we put a two-cent tax on their 50,000,001st dollar and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition-free college, put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities-
539	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator Warren.
540	Senator Warren	-and cancel… No, let me finish please… and cancel student loan debt for 95% of the people who have it.
541	Senator Warren	My question is not, “Why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax?” It’s, “Why does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?”
542	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator Warren.
543	Joe Biden	No one is supporting billionaires.
544	Erin Burnett	Mayor Buttigieg.
545	Erin Burnett	Mayor Buttigieg.
546	Erin Burnett	Your response.
547	Pete Buttigieg	I’m all for a wealth tax.
548	Pete Buttigieg	I’m all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers.
549	Pete Buttigieg	Let me tell you, though, how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live.
550	Pete Buttigieg	Washington politicians, congressmen, and senators saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes.
551	Pete Buttigieg	I didn’t even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad’s Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school.
552	Pete Buttigieg	I didn’t know that wasn’t every city until I went away to college.
553	Pete Buttigieg	Now I drive my own Chevy.
554	Pete Buttigieg	It’s a Chevy Cruze.
555	Pete Buttigieg	Used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers.
556	Pete Buttigieg	But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place?
557	Pete Buttigieg	It’s because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything, and while he’s unquestionably made it dramatically worse, this is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things.
558	Pete Buttigieg	We’re paying attention-
559	Erin Burnett	Thank you.
560	Erin Burnett	Mayor.
561	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.
562	Pete Buttigieg	-to who sounded better on a debate stage or in a committee hearing versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done.
563	Erin Burnett	Senator Klobuchar.
564	Erin Burnett	Senator Klobuchar.
565	Amy Klobuchar	I want to give a reality-
566	Erin Burnett	Will a wealth tax work?
567	Amy Klobuchar	It could work.
568	Amy Klobuchar	I am open to it, but I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires.
569	Amy Klobuchar	Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.
570	Amy Klobuchar	We just have different approaches.
571	Amy Klobuchar	Your idea is not the only idea.
572	Amy Klobuchar	When I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, “Guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.” That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth.
573	Amy Klobuchar	We have different ways.
574	Amy Klobuchar	I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that helped the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation.
575	Amy Klobuchar	You add it all up, you got a lot of money that one, helps pay for that childcare, protects that dignity of work, makes sure we have decent retirement and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools.
576	Erin Burnett	Thank you.
577	Amy Klobuchar	It is not one idea that rules here.
578	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
579	Erin Burnett	Senator Warren, please respond.
580	Senator Warren	Understand, taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way tax and wealth does, that the rich are not like you and me.
581	Senator Warren	The really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth and it just keeps growing.
582	Senator Warren	We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation.
583	Senator Warren	Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.
584	Amy Klobuchar	Oh, I would like to respond to that.
585	Erin Burnett	Senator Klobuchar.
586	Erin Burnett	Respond, please.
587	Amy Klobuchar	I think simply because you have different ideas doesn’t mean you’re fighting for regular people.
588	Amy Klobuchar	I wouldn’t even be up on this stage if it wasn’t for unions and the dignity of work.
589	Amy Klobuchar	If my grandpa didn’t have unions protecting him in those mines, he wouldn’t have survived.
590	Amy Klobuchar	If my mom didn’t have unions as a teacher, she wouldn’t have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced.
591	Amy Klobuchar	Just because we have different ideas and get to the same place in terms of beating Donald Trump and taking this on… We are in Ohio, we can win Ohio and the presidency, but only if we unite, if we unite around ideals and don’t go fighting against each other, and instead take the fight to him.
592	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator.
593	Erin Burnett	Senator Harris, you want to give working families a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year to help close the income gap.
594	Kamala Harris	Right.
595	Erin Burnett	Is that a better solution than a wealth tax?
596	Kamala Harris	Well, here’s how I think about it.
597	Kamala Harris	When I was growing up, my mother raised my sister and me.
598	Kamala Harris	We would often come home from school before she came home from work.
599	Kamala Harris	She’d come home, she’d cook dinner, and at some point we’d go to bed and she’d sit up at the kitchen table, trying to figure out how to make it all work.
600	Kamala Harris	When I think about where we are right now in 2020, I do believe justices on the ballot.
601	Kamala Harris	It’s on the ballot in terms of impeachment.
602	Kamala Harris	It’s on the ballot in terms of economic justice, health justice, and so many other issues.
603	Kamala Harris	When I think about this issue, I’m thinking about that dad, who tonight is going to be sitting his kitchen table after everyone’s gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee, trying to figure out how he’s going to make it work.
604	Kamala Harris	He’s probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, he’s going to have to start driving an Uber.
605	Kamala Harris	What does that mean?
606	Kamala Harris	That means that with those two jobs, he’s going to miss his kids’ soccer games.
607	Kamala Harris	That’s the reality for Americans today, which is why yes, when I get elected and and pass this bill, which will give the American family who makes less than $100,000 a year a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year that they can take home at up to $500 a month, that’s going to make a real difference in that man’s life.
608	Kamala Harris	Don’t tell him that’s not a big deal-
609	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator.
610	Kamala Harris	-when he’s trying to get through the end of the month.
611	Erin Burnett	Mr. Yang, your response.
612	Erin Burnett	Would you oppose a wealth tax?
613	Andrew Yang	Senator Warren is 100% right that we’re in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history, and a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle.
614	Andrew Yang	The problem is that it’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all of those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they’d projected.
615	Andrew Yang	If we can’t learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from?
616	Andrew Yang	We should not be looking to other countries’ mistakes.
617	Andrew Yang	Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax.
618	Andrew Yang	If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it.
619	Erin Burnett	Thank you.
620	Erin Burnett	Thank you.
621	Erin Burnett	Congressman O’Rourke, do you think a wealth tax is the best way to address income inequality?
622	Erin Burnett	Your response.
623	Beto O’Rourke	I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up, and sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.
624	Beto O’Rourke	I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada.
625	Beto O’Rourke	She’s working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities.
626	Beto O’Rourke	Any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already.
627	Beto O’Rourke	Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations.
628	Beto O’Rourke	She wants to know how we are going to help her.
629	Beto O’Rourke	How we’re going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs, that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities, that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage.
630	Beto O’Rourke	Senator Warren said, “Show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and you’ll show me your values.” She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person I met would see a tax increase.
631	Beto O’Rourke	Under my administration, if you make less than $250,000 a year as a family, you will not see a tax increase.
632	Beto O’Rourke	That family needs to know that.
633	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Congressman.
634	Tom Steyer	Erin, let me say, this is a-
635	Erin Burnett	I want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.
636	Senator Warren	I’m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I’m punitive.
637	Senator Warren	Look, I don’t have a beef with billionaires.
638	Senator Warren	My problem is, you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you.
639	Senator Warren	But you built that fortune in America, I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate.
640	Senator Warren	You built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for.
641	Senator Warren	You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for.
642	Senator Warren	All I’m saying is, you make it to the top, the top one-tenth of 1%, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.
643	Erin Burnett	Senator, thank you.
644	Erin Burnett	Secretary Castro, your response?
645	Beto O’Rourke	There’s no argument there.
646	Beto O’Rourke	I just want to make sure that we’re lifting up those families who are working and need help through an expanded earned income tax credit-
647	Senator Warren	But that is-
648	Beto O’Rourke	-or child tax credit, which we will do in my administration.
649	Erin Burnett	Go ahead.
650	Erin Burnett	Go ahead, Senator.
651	Senator Warren	That is the point.
652	Senator Warren	This is universal childcare for every baby in this country.
653	Senator Warren	Early educational opportunities for every child.
654	Senator Warren	Universal pre-K, no matter where you live, for every three-year-old and four-year-old.
655	Senator Warren	Raising the wages-
656	Beto O’Rourke	But in addition to that, will they see a tax increase?
657	Senator Warren	No.
658	Senator Warren	Raising the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country.
659	Senator Warren	This is about universal college, about investment in our HBCUs, about making sure that we get rid of the student loan debt burden-
660	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator.
661	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator.
662	Senator Warren	-that is crushing 43 million American-
663	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator.
664	Erin Burnett	Secretary Castro.
665	Beto O’Rourke	On this much, we agree.
666	Beto O’Rourke	I just want to know if working families are going to get a tax increase.
667	Erin Burnett	I want to get Secretary Castro in here, please, Congressman.
668	Erin Burnett	Go ahead, Secretary.
669	Julian Castro	Thanks a lot, Erin.
670	Julian Castro	You see that everybody has their own plans.
671	Julian Castro	Let me just say that the way that I view this is born out of my own experience.
672	Julian Castro	I grew up like I bet a lot of folks in this room grew up, and folks that are watching on TV.
673	Julian Castro	I grew up with my twin brother walking in a single parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom, my grandmother, and we knew what it was like a to wonder whether we’re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month or sometimes have the electricity turned off and when I was a kid to look at the grocery list that seemed to get shorter and shorter and that’s what’s happening to a lot of families these days.
674	Julian Castro	I was in Las Vegas a few months ago and I visited people who are homeless, who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the Las Vegas Strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations.
675	Julian Castro	We can do better than that.
676	Julian Castro	I believe that a wealth inequality tax, as I’ve proposed, is part of the answer, but also I’ve proposed an inheritance tax, raising the top marginal tax rate-
677	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Secretary.
678	Bernie Sanders	Erin.
679	Bernie Sanders	Erin.
680	Bernie Sanders	Erin.
681	Julian Castro	-and investing in things like universal childcare and affordable housing.
682	Erin Burnett	Senator Booker, please respond.
683	Senator Booker	Well, first of all, I just want to respond by… You know, we’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president.
684	Senator Booker	How we talk about each other in this debate actually, really matters.
685	Senator Booker	I’ve had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage, and tearing each other down because we have a different plan, to me, is unacceptable.
686	Senator Booker	I have seen this script before.
687	Senator Booker	It didn’t work in 2016 and it will be disaster for us in 2020.
688	Senator Booker	I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren.
689	Senator Booker	I have a different plan than many people on this stage.
690	Senator Booker	It involves, again, fair taxes for the richest.
691	Senator Booker	We have a lot of work to do there, but we’ve had 20 years of presidential debates and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty.
692	Senator Booker	We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and more persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure a fair taxes are paid by people on the top, but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world.
693	Senator Booker	My plan will focus on that, and these are some of the issues we should be talking about, not defining ourselves just by what we’re against, but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are for.
694	Amy Klobuchar	Amen.
695	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator Booker.
696	A. Cooper	We’ve got to take a quick break.
697	A. Cooper	We’ve got to take a quick break right now.
698	A. Cooper	The CNN/New York times debate, live from Otterbein University in Ohio, will be right back after this.
699	Anderson Cooper	Welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic Presidential Debate, live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.
700	Anderson Cooper	I want to turn now to foreign policy.
701	Anderson Cooper	President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all American forces from Northern Syria, abandoning America’s longtime Kurdish allies.
702	Anderson Cooper	As a result, Turkey has now invaded Syria, ISIS detainees have escaped, and the Kurds have announced a new deal with the government in Damascus, a victory for Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and Russia and Iran.
703	Anderson Cooper	Vice President Biden, we know you would not have withdrawn troops from Northern Syria in this way, but that is already in process.
704	Anderson Cooper	So would you send American troops back into Northern Syria to prevent an ISIS resurgence and protect our Kurdish allies?
705	Joe Biden	I would not have withdrawn the troops, and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad’s people, and the President of the United States saying, “If those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they’re in, they’ll only go to Europe.
706	Joe Biden	It won’t affect us.” It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history, excuse me, in terms of foreign policy.
707	Joe Biden	And the fact of the matter is, I’ve never seen a time, and I spent thousands of hours in the situation room, I’ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what?
708	Joe Biden	Our commanders, across the board, former and present are ashamed of what’s happening here.
709	Joe Biden	What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, he’s going to have a problem because Turkey is the real problem here.
710	Joe Biden	And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan, and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done.
711	Joe Biden	Now, pay that price.
712	Anderson Cooper	Just to clarify, Mr. Vice President, would you want American troops back in Northern Syria?
713	Joe Biden	I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they’re not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what in fact needs to be done, protecting those Kurds.
714	Joe Biden	They lost their lives.
715	Joe Biden	This is shameful, shameful what this man has done.
716	Anderson Cooper	Congresswoman Gabbard, last week, you said that American troops should get out of Syria now.
717	Anderson Cooper	You don’t agree with how the President handled the withdrawal.
718	Anderson Cooper	What would you have done differently?
719	Anderson Cooper	How would you have pulled out troops without the bloodshed we’re seeing now?
720	Tulsi Gabbard	Oh, first of all, we’ve got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we’ve been waging in Syria.
721	Tulsi Gabbard	Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war.
722	Tulsi Gabbard	Not only that, but New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war.
723	Tulsi Gabbard	Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I’m a Russian asset, and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears.
724	Tulsi Gabbard	This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I’m an asset of Russia.
725	Tulsi Gabbard	Completely despicable.
726	Tulsi Gabbard	As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things: ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen that have caused tens and thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve; and I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like Al-Qaeda in Syria who have been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.
727	Tulsi Gabbard	I’d like to ask Senator Warren if she would join me in calling for an end to this regime change war in Syria, finally?
728	Senator Warren	So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East.
729	Senator Warren	I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East.
730	Senator Warren	But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.
731	Senator Warren	What this President has done is that he has sucked up to dictators, he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesn’t understand, he has cut and run on our allies, and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America.
732	Senator Warren	In Syria, he has created a bigger than ever humanitarian crisis, he has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life.
733	Senator Warren	I sit on the Armed Services Committee, I talk with our military leaders about this.
734	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Senator.
735	Senator Warren	I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed.
736	Senator Warren	We need to get out-
737	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
738	Senator Warren	… but we need to do this through a negotiated solution.
739	Anderson Cooper	Yeah, thank you, Senator.
740	Senator Warren	There is no military solution-
741	Anderson Cooper	Mayor Buttigieg-
742	Senator Warren	… in this region.
743	Anderson Cooper	Mayor Buttigieg, like many of your fellow candidates on the stage, you’ve been calling for an end to endless wars.
744	Anderson Cooper	What’s your response on Syria?
745	Pete Buttigieg	Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong.
746	Pete Buttigieg	The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it’s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal, by this President, of American allies and American values.
747	Pete Buttigieg	Look, I didn’t think we should’ve gone to Iraq in the first place, I think we need to get out of Afghanistan, but it’s also the case that a small number of specialized special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we’re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide, and the resurgence of ISIS.
748	Pete Buttigieg	Meanwhile, soldiers in the field are reporting that, for the first time, they feel ashamed, ashamed of what their country has done.
749	Pete Buttigieg	We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership?
750	Pete Buttigieg	And when I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word, and our allies knew it, and our enemies lose that.
751	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Mayor.
752	Pete Buttigieg	You take that away, you are taking away what makes America America.
753	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Mayor.
754	Pete Buttigieg	It makes our troops and the world a much more dangerous place.
755	Anderson Cooper	Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?
756	Tulsi Gabbard	Yeah, absolutely.
757	Tulsi Gabbard	So really what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security, you would continue this policy of the U.S. actually providing arms and support to terrorist groups in Syria, like Al-Qaeda, HTS, Al-Nusra, and others because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war.
758	Tulsi Gabbard	That’s really what you’re saying.
759	Anderson Cooper	Mayor Buttigieg?
760	Pete Buttigieg	No, you can embrace, or you can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump’s policy as you’re doing.
761	Tulsi Gabbard	Will you end the regime change war is the question?
762	Pete Buttigieg	What we are doing-
763	Tulsi Gabbard	What is an endless war, if it’s not yet another regime change war?
764	Anderson Cooper	Allow him to respond.
765	Anderson Cooper	Please allow him to respond.
766	Pete Buttigieg	What we are doing, or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.
767	Pete Buttigieg	Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up too.
768	Pete Buttigieg	When I was deployed, not just the Afghan National Army Forces, but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S.
769	Pete Buttigieg	Forces.
770	Pete Buttigieg	I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there.
771	Pete Buttigieg	And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers.
772	Pete Buttigieg	You take away-
773	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
774	Pete Buttigieg	… the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.
775	Pete Buttigieg	This President has betrayed American values-
776	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
777	Pete Buttigieg	… our credibility is in tatter.
778	Pete Buttigieg	I will restore U.S. credibility before it is finally too late.
779	Anderson Cooper	Senator Sanders, is his Turkey still a U.S. ally?
780	Anderson Cooper	Should they remain in NATO?
781	Bernie Sanders	I’m sorry, say that again?
782	Anderson Cooper	Is Turkey is still a U.S. ally?
783	Anderson Cooper	Should they remain in NATO?
784	Bernie Sanders	No, Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.
785	Bernie Sanders	The crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people … And in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded.
786	Bernie Sanders	And the United States said, “We are with you.
787	Bernie Sanders	We’re standing with you.” And then suddenly one day, after a phone call with Erdogan, announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy.
788	Bernie Sanders	Now you tell me, what country in the world will trust the word of the President of the United States?
789	Bernie Sanders	In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.
790	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Senator-
791	Pete Buttigieg	But this is really important, because what this President has done shows that American leadership shapes the behavior of our allies, or sometimes allies too.
792	Pete Buttigieg	Remember, the problem right now is not just with our competitors.
793	Pete Buttigieg	In for example, a place like China, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy, and don’t get a peep of support from the President.
794	Pete Buttigieg	It’s not just the behavior of adversaries like Russia, but our one-time allies like Saudi Arabia, which the CIA just concluded was responsible, as we all knew, for murdering and dismembering an American resident and journalist, and Turkey, which was an American ally.
795	Pete Buttigieg	That’s the point.
796	Pete Buttigieg	We had leverage, but when we abandoned the international stage, when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation, the consequence is-
797	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Mayor.
798	Pete Buttigieg	… the disappearance of U.S. leadership from the world stage, and that makes this entire world a more dangerous place.
799	Anderson Cooper	Senator Klobuchar, should Turkey remain in NATO?
800	Anderson Cooper	Your response?
801	Amy Klobuchar	We need to work with our allies to work with Turkey and bring them out.
802	Amy Klobuchar	This is an outrageous thing that happened here, and I think we need to talk about this a not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with Turkey, but the fact that our President blew it, and now he’s too proud to say it, and what do we do now?
803	Amy Klobuchar	We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say, “Come back, Turkey, and stop this.” Because what Mayor Pete has just said is true.
804	Amy Klobuchar	Think about our other allies, Israel.
805	Amy Klobuchar	How do they feel right now?
806	Amy Klobuchar	Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Mid-East.
807	Amy Klobuchar	Think about our allies in Europe when he pulls out of the Iranian agreement, and leaves them holding the bag, and gives the power to China and Russia.
808	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Senator.
809	Amy Klobuchar	Think about the nuclear agreement with Russia that he precipitously pulled out of.
810	Amy Klobuchar	This is part of a pattern.
811	Amy Klobuchar	It’s not an isolated incident.
812	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Senator.
813	Anderson Cooper	Senator Harris, given that the U.S. abandoned our Kurdish allies, what would you do as President to convince the rest of the world that we can still be trusted?
814	Kamala Harris	That’s a great question, Anderson, because the Commander in Chief of the United States of America has, as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities, to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland.
815	Kamala Harris	I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
816	Kamala Harris	I have over a period of time received classified information about the threats to our security, and hotspots around the world.
817	Kamala Harris	What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out.
818	Kamala Harris	And in this case, he sold out the Kurds, who, yes, fought with us and thousands died in our fight against ISIS.
819	Kamala Harris	And let’s be clear, what Donald Trump has done because of that phone call with Erdogan is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get out of jail free card.
820	Kamala Harris	And you know who the winner is in this?
821	Kamala Harris	There are four: Russia, Iran, Assad, and ISIS.
822	Kamala Harris	This is a crisis of Donald Trump’s making, and it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trump’s making.
823	Kamala Harris	And that’s why dude got to go, and when I am Commander in Chief, we will stop this madness.
824	Anderson Cooper	Secretary Castro, your response?
825	Julian Castro	Well, I mean you asked the question of how are we going to get people to trust us again?
826	Julian Castro	The first thing is we’ve got to boot Donald Trump out of the Oval Office so that people will trust us again.
827	Julian Castro	You know, I also want people to think, the folks this week that saw those images of ISIS prisoners running free, to think about how absurd it is that this President is caging kids on the border, and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free.
828	Julian Castro	He has made a tremendous mistake, a total disaster there in Syria.
829	Julian Castro	And just to connect the dots for a second, if you’re Kim Jong Un, for instance, why in the world would you believe anything that this President says to contain your nuclear weapons program when he tore up an Iran nuclear agreement that we just signed four years ago, which was the strongest agreement to contain Iran’s nuclear weapons program, and now he’s abandoned the very people that we gave our word to?
830	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
831	Julian Castro	I would make sure that we work with our allies to pressure Syria-
832	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
833	Julian Castro	… to stop the aggression, and I support efforts at stronger sanctions than this president has announced.
834	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
835	Marc Lacey	Senator Booker, the American Intelligence community says that Russia is trying to capitalize on the power vacuums around the world as we’re seeing right now in Northern Syria.
836	Marc Lacey	What specifically would you do as President to check Vladimir Putin’s power on the world stage?
837	Senator Booker	So first of all, understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire.
838	Senator Booker	We literally have great generals, like Mattis, who said on the world stage, “The United States of America.
839	Senator Booker	There can be no better friend than the United States of America, and no greater enemy than the United States of America.” This President has turned that upside down, and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances, and partner with Russia.
840	Senator Booker	And so clearly, to your question, number one, we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow and influence by abandoning the world stage.
841	Senator Booker	We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine, and Latvia, and Lithuania, but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable.
842	Senator Booker	Russia and Putin understand strength, and this President, time and time again, is showing moral weakness.
843	Senator Booker	He makes promises to the American people, that he’s going to protect this nation.
844	Senator Booker	Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS, he’s now given them a foothold again.
845	Senator Booker	This is an American President that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he’s bringing our troops home.
846	Senator Booker	At the same time, he’s increasing true presence with the Saudis while they’re involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen.
847	Senator Booker	This president is making us less safe.
848	Senator Booker	He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron.
849	Senator Booker	As President of the United States, I will stop this and restore American integrity abroad.
850	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
851	Marc Lacey	Vice President?
852	Joe Biden	I think I may be, doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan.
853	Joe Biden	And Erdogan understands that … You talk about should he stay in or out of NATO?
854	Joe Biden	He understands that he’s out of NATO, he’s in real trouble.
855	Joe Biden	But the fact of the matter is we have been one willing in this administration because we have an erratic, crazy President who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy, and operates out of fear for his own reelection.
856	Joe Biden	Think what’s happened.
857	Joe Biden	The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO.
858	Joe Biden	What does the president do?
859	Joe Biden	He says, “I believe Vladimir Putin.
860	Joe Biden	I don’t believe our intelligence community.”
861	Bernie Sanders	Are you suggesting I’m Vladimir Putin?
862	Joe Biden	No, no, I’m not.
863	Joe Biden	No, no, I’m not.
864	Joe Biden	I’m not.
865	Joe Biden	I’m not.
866	Bernie Sanders	I know.
867	Joe Biden	I’m not.
868	Joe Biden	But here, look, but here’s the deal.
869	Joe Biden	Think what that did.
870	Joe Biden	He turns around, and he questions whether or not he’ll keep the sacred commitment of Article 5 for the NATO members.
871	Joe Biden	If he is reelected, I promise you, there will be no NATO.
872	Joe Biden	Our security will be vastly underrated, under … We will be in real trouble.
873	Joe Biden	And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy, we’d change the regime.
874	Joe Biden	It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds and thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border.
875	Joe Biden	And lastly, and I apologize for going up, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to, I mean excuse me, in Afghanistan as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS, it’s going to come here.
876	Joe Biden	They are going to, in fact, damage the United States of America.
877	Joe Biden	That’s why we got involved in the first place, and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians.
878	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
879	Marc Lacey	Congressman O’Rourke, Senate Democrats put out a report last year on Russia’s hostile actions around the world.
880	Marc Lacey	They suggest the next president could fight back by publicly revealing what the U.S. knows about Putin’s corruption, and work with allies to freeze his bank accounts.
881	Marc Lacey	Would you take either of those actions, even in the face of possible retaliation?
882	Beto O’Rourke	Yes, we must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world’s greatest democracy, and being able to do it, thanks to Donald Trump, functionally, with impunity so far, so much so that they are invading this democracy right now, as we speak, still at the invitation of this President.
883	Beto O’Rourke	So if there are not consequences, we will continue to see this problem going forward.
884	Beto O’Rourke	But in addition, [foreign language 01:25:23], to answer the previous question that you asked, how do we stand up to Russia on the global stage?
885	Beto O’Rourke	We do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships.
886	Beto O’Rourke	That is what makes America stronger.
887	Beto O’Rourke	There isn’t enough money in this country, there aren’t enough service members, as brave and courageous as they are, to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world.
888	Beto O’Rourke	And the Kurds are case in point.
889	Beto O’Rourke	In fact, because we turned our backs on them, those Kurds who fought for us in Syria, helped to defeat ISIS, not just for themselves, but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of service members to fight those battles there.
890	Beto O’Rourke	And then lastly, as General Mattis, who was invoked earlier, has said, we have two powers: one of intimidation and one of inspiration.
891	Beto O’Rourke	We need to now focus on that latter power, and make sure that we invest in diplomacy in our State Department, and peacefully and non-violently resolving our foreign policy goals.
892	Beto O’Rourke	Not on the backs of 18, and 19, and 20 year olds anymore.
893	Beto O’Rourke	But making sure that our diplomats are invested in, have the focus necessary by this next president to make sure that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world.
894	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Congressman.
895	Marc Lacey	Mr. Steyer, would you publicly reveal what the U.S. knows about Putin’s corruption or work to freeze his bank accounts?
896	Marc Lacey	Please respond.
897	Tom Steyer	Absolutely.
898	Tom Steyer	As far as I’m concerned, Mr. Trump’s America first program, which involves having no plans, having no process, and having no partners is proved to be a disaster in Syria, it’s proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russia’s attacking our democracy, and more than that, when we look at the problems around the world, the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense.
899	Tom Steyer	Let’s go to the most important international problem that we’re facing, which no one has brought up, which is climate.
900	Tom Steyer	We can’t solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves.
901	Tom Steyer	It’s an international crisis.
902	Tom Steyer	I’ve been working on it for 10 years, taking on the corporations.
903	Tom Steyer	But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world.
904	Tom Steyer	So if you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course he’s been bought by the oil and gas companies.
905	Tom Steyer	But any problem that we’re going to do, but specifically climate, we’re going to have to lead the world morally, we’re going to have to lead it technologically, financially, and commercially.
906	Tom Steyer	This is the proof that this kind of America first, go it alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I’ve ever heard, and I would change it on day one in every single light.
907	Marc Lacey	Mr. Yang, your response to Putin and Russia?
908	Andrew Yang	Of course.
909	Andrew Yang	We have to look at the chain of events.
910	Andrew Yang	How did we get here?
911	Andrew Yang	The fact is, we were falling apart at home, so we voted in Donald Trump, and he’s now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy.
912	Andrew Yang	We have to let Russia know, “Look, we get it.
913	Andrew Yang	We’ve tampered with other elections.
914	Andrew Yang	You’ve tampered with our elections.
915	Andrew Yang	And now it has to stop.
916	Andrew Yang	And if it does not stop, we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people.” I believe most Americans would support me on this.
917	Andrew Yang	But Russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the 21st century threats: artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, climate change, loose nuclear material, military drones and non-state actors.
918	Andrew Yang	These are the threats that are going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology.
919	Andrew Yang	We all know we are decades behind the curve on technology.
920	Andrew Yang	We saw when Mark Zuckerberg testified at Congress, the nature of the questioning.
921	Andrew Yang	As Commander in Chief, I will help pull us forward-
922	Marc Lacey	Thank you.
923	Amy Klobuchar	Marc, I want to respond-
924	Andrew Yang	… and that’s going to be a huge responsibility of the next president.
925	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Mr. Yang.
926	Amy Klobuchar	I want to respond to Mr. Yang.
927	Amy Klobuchar	I don’t see a moral equivalency between our country and Russia.
928	Amy Klobuchar	Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent, and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election.
929	Amy Klobuchar	This wasn’t meddling.
930	Amy Klobuchar	That’s what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she’s doing.
931	Amy Klobuchar	Sorry.
932	Joe Biden	He has no soul.
933	Amy Klobuchar	This was much more serious than that.
934	Amy Klobuchar	This was actually invading our election.
935	Amy Klobuchar	So to protect ourselves in 2020, what we need, one, backup paper ballots in every single state.
936	Amy Klobuchar	That is the bill that I need, and we need to stop Mitch McConnell from stopping that from happening.
937	Amy Klobuchar	And then we need to stop the social media companies from running paid political ads, including ones last time in rubles, without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them.
938	Amy Klobuchar	That’s the Honest Ads Act, that’s a bipartisan bill that I lead.
939	Amy Klobuchar	And we can’t wait to become-
940	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
941	Amy Klobuchar	… president to get that done, we need to get it done now.
942	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
943	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
944	Anderson Cooper	We want to turn back to domestic issues, in the epidemic of gun violence in this country.
945	Anderson Cooper	We’re less than 100 miles from Dayton, Ohio, where two months ago, a gunman killed nine people using an AR-15 style weapon with a high capacity magazine.
946	Anderson Cooper	Congressman O’Rourke, in the last debate you said, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” But when you were asked how you’d enforce a mandatory buyback, you said police wouldn’t be going door to door.
947	Anderson Cooper	So how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons?
948	Anderson Cooper	You don’t even know who has those weapons.
949	Beto O’Rourke	Look, we’re going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans.
950	Beto O’Rourke	I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it’s not right, and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR-15s and AK-47s.
951	Beto O’Rourke	Those are weapons of war.
952	Beto O’Rourke	That they were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield.
953	Beto O’Rourke	You mentioned the massacre in Dayton, nine people killed in under 40 seconds.
954	Beto O’Rourke	In El Paso, Texas, 22 were killed in under three minutes.
955	Beto O’Rourke	And the list goes on throughout the country.
956	Beto O’Rourke	So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they’re also too dangerous to own.
957	Beto O’Rourke	Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror.
958	Beto O’Rourke	Just ask Hispanics in Texas, Univision surveyed them, more than 80% feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican Americans and immigrants, inspired in part by this President’s racism and hatred that he’s directed at communities like mine in El Paso.
959	Anderson Cooper	Congressman-
960	Beto O’Rourke	So I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law, the same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now.
961	Beto O’Rourke	We don’t go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law.
962	Beto O’Rourke	I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, non gun owners alike-
963	Anderson Cooper	Congressman, let me follow up.
964	Beto O’Rourke	… to respect and follow the law.
965	Anderson Cooper	Just to follow up, your expectations aside, your website says you will find people who don’t give up their weapons.
966	Anderson Cooper	That doesn’t take those weapons off the streets.
967	Anderson Cooper	So to be clear, exactly how are you going to take away weapons from people who do not want to give them up, and you don’t know where they are?
968	Beto O’Rourke	If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them.
969	Beto O’Rourke	If they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement.
970	Beto O’Rourke	But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law.
971	Beto O’Rourke	I believe in this country.
972	Beto O’Rourke	I believe in my fellow Americans.
973	Beto O’Rourke	I believe that they will do the right thing.
974	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
975	Anderson Cooper	Mayor Buttigieg, just yesterday you referred to mandatory buybacks as confiscation, and said that Congressman O’Rourke has been picking a fight to try to stay relevant.
976	Anderson Cooper	Your response on guns?
977	Pete Buttigieg	Well, Congressman, you just made it clear that you don’t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets.
978	Pete Buttigieg	If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it, but we can’t wait.
979	Pete Buttigieg	People are dying in the streets right now.
980	Pete Buttigieg	We can’t wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through.
981	Pete Buttigieg	We can’t wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high capacity magazines so we don’t wind up with millions more of these things on the street.
982	Pete Buttigieg	We can’t wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country.
983	Pete Buttigieg	We cannot wait for purity tests.
984	Pete Buttigieg	We have to just get something done.
985	Anderson Cooper	Congressman O’Rourke, your response?
986	Beto O’Rourke	This is not a purity test.
987	Beto O’Rourke	This is a country that loses 40,000 of fellow Americans every year to gun violence.
988	Beto O’Rourke	This is a crisis, and we’ve got to do something about it.
989	Beto O’Rourke	And those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I’m describing.
990	Beto O’Rourke	I want to make sure we have universal background checks, and red flag laws, and that we end the sale of these weapons of war.
991	Beto O’Rourke	But to use the analogy of healthcare, it would be as though we said, “Look, we’re for primary care, but let’s not talk about mental healthcare because that’s a bridge too far.
992	Beto O’Rourke	People need that primary care now, so let’s save that for another day.” No, let’s decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and then let’s bring this country together in order to do that.
993	Beto O’Rourke	Listening to my fellow Americans, to those moms who demand action, to those students who march for our lives, who in fact came up with this extraordinary bold peace plan-
994	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Congressman.
995	Beto O’Rourke	… that calls for mandatory buybacks.
996	Beto O’Rourke	Let’s follow their inspiration and lead, and not be limited by the polls, and the consultants, and the focus groups.
997	Beto O’Rourke	Let’s do what’s right-
998	Anderson Cooper	Mayor Buttigieg, your response?
999	Beto O’Rourke	… while we have time to do what’s right.
1000	Anderson Cooper	Mayor Buttigieg?
1001	Pete Buttigieg	The problem isn’t the polls, the problem is the policy.
1002	Pete Buttigieg	And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.
1003	Pete Buttigieg	Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done.
1004	Pete Buttigieg	Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don’t agree with your particular idea of how to handle this, the problem is the National Rifle Association and their enablers in Congress, and we should be united in taking the fight to them.
1005	Beto O’Rourke	That’s a mischaracterization.
1006	Beto O’Rourke	Anderson, I’ve got answered this.
1007	Beto O’Rourke	Never took you or anyone else on who disagrees with me on this issue.
1008	Beto O’Rourke	But when you, Mayor Buttigieg, described this policy as a shiny object, I don’t care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but to those who have survived gun violence, those who’ve lost a loved one to an AR-15, an AK-47.
1009	Beto O’Rourke	March For Our Lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics, and poll-tested politicians.
1010	Beto O’Rourke	That was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups, and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an AK-47.
1011	Beto O’Rourke	We must buy them back.
1012	Anderson Cooper	Congressman, thank-
1013	Pete Buttigieg	What we owe to those survivors is to actually deliver a solution.
1014	Pete Buttigieg	I’m glad you offered up-
1015	Anderson Cooper	All right.
1016	Pete Buttigieg	… that analogy to healthcare because this is really important.
1017	Pete Buttigieg	We are at the cusp of building a new American majority, to actually do things that congressmen and senators have been talking about with almost no impact for my entire-
1018	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Mayor.
1019	Pete Buttigieg	… adult life.
1020	Pete Buttigieg	No, this is really important, okay?
1021	Pete Buttigieg	On guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban.
1022	Pete Buttigieg	That would be huge.
1023	Pete Buttigieg	… guns.
1024	Pete Buttigieg	We are this close to an assault weapons ban.
1025	Pete Buttigieg	That would be huge and we’re going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether it’s, “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your guns.” We have an opportunity to deliver-
1026	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, [crosstalk 01:36:11]-
1027	Pete Buttigieg	… healthcare to everybody, and someone on this stage was saying, “It doesn’t count?”
1028	Beto O’Rourke	[crosstalk 00:01:36:15].
1029	Anderson Cooper	Senator Buttigieg, I want to give other candidates a chance.
1030	Anderson Cooper	Senator Booker, what’s your response to Mayor Buttigieg?
1031	Senator Booker	Look, I again worry about how we talk to each other and about each other and what this last week has shown.
1032	Senator Booker	There’s a young man in my neighborhood … I watched him grow up, I lived in some high rise projects with him … named Shahad, and he was murdered on my block last year with an assault rifle.
1033	Senator Booker	I’m living with a sense of urgency on this problem, because when I go home to my community, like millions of Americans, we live in communities where these weapons, where these gunshots are real every single day.
1034	Senator Booker	And I know where the American public is.
1035	Senator Booker	This is not about leadership.
1036	Senator Booker	This is why when I talk about things like gun licensing and point out the differences between us, I’m not attacking people or their character or their courage on these issues.
1037	Senator Booker	We all have courage, but it’s frustrating that when the American people, 77% of Americans agree on licensing.
1038	Senator Booker	We don’t need leadership right now.
1039	Senator Booker	We just need folks who are going to stand up and follow where the people already are, because there are millions of Americans where this is a daily nightmare, where we’re surrendering our freedoms-
1040	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
1041	Senator Booker	… to fear in this country.
1042	Senator Booker	This is the first time in American history, this fall, where we have sent our children to school, the strongest nation on the planet Earth, and said to them, “We can’t protect you-
1043	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Senator.
1044	Senator Booker	… so in school we’re going to teach you how to hide.” There are more duck-and-cover drills and shelter-in-place drills in America now than fire drills.
1045	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Senator.
1046	Senator Booker	If I’m President of the United States, I will bring an urgency to this issue and make sure we end the scourge of mass violence.
1047	Anderson Cooper	Senator Klobuchar, Senator Warren supports a voluntary … Excuse me, Senator Klobuchar, you support a voluntary buyback, if I’m correct, right?
1048	Amy Klobuchar	Correct.
1049	Anderson Cooper	What is wrong with a mandatory buyback?
1050	Anderson Cooper	Your response.
1051	Amy Klobuchar	I just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this.
1052	Amy Klobuchar	I’m looking at the Mayor of Dayton.
1053	Amy Klobuchar	I met one of those survivors from that shooting.
1054	Amy Klobuchar	30 seconds, nine people killed.
1055	Amy Klobuchar	The public is with us on this in a big way.
1056	Amy Klobuchar	The majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks right now.
1057	Amy Klobuchar	The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation.
1058	Amy Klobuchar	There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnell’s desk.
1059	Amy Klobuchar	The background check bill.
1060	Amy Klobuchar	My bill to close the boyfriend loophole so domestic abusers don’t get guns.
1061	Amy Klobuchar	The bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun.
1062	Amy Klobuchar	That’s what we should be focusing on.
1063	Amy Klobuchar	And I just don’t want to screw this up.
1064	Amy Klobuchar	When I’m president, I do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and I do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in Dayton, Ohio will never happen again, but let’s not mess this up with this fight.
1065	Anderson Cooper	Senator Warren, you support a voluntary gun buyback of assault style weapons, as well.
1066	Anderson Cooper	Why not a mandatory one?
1067	Senator Warren	Look, I want to get what work’s done.
1068	Senator Warren	I want to use the method we used, for example, with machine guns.
1069	Senator Warren	We registered them.
1070	Senator Warren	We put in a huge penalty if you didn’t register them and a huge tax on them and let people turn them in, and it got machine guns out of the hands of people.
1071	Senator Warren	But the problem here that we need to focus on is first how widespread gun violence is.
1072	Senator Warren	As you’ve rightly identified, it’s not just about mass shootings, it’s what happens in neighborhoods all across this country.
1073	Senator Warren	It is about suicide.
1074	Senator Warren	It is about domestic violence.
1075	Senator Warren	This is not going to be a one and done that we do one thing or two things or three things and then we’re done.
1076	Senator Warren	We have to reduce gun violence overall, and the question we have to ask is why hasn’t it happened?
1077	Senator Warren	You say, we’re so close.
1078	Senator Warren	We have been so close.
1079	Senator Warren	I stood in the United States Senate in 2013 when 54 senators voted in favor of gun legislation-
1080	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Senator.
1081	Senator Warren	… and it didn’t pass because of the filibuster.
1082	Anderson Cooper	Senator-
1083	Senator Warren	We’ve got to attack the corruption and repeal the filibusters-
1084	Anderson Cooper	Senator Harris.
1085	Senator Warren	… or the gun industry will always have a veto over what happens.
1086	Anderson Cooper	Senator Harris, you disagree with Senator Warren.
1087	Anderson Cooper	You think the buyback should be mandatory.
1088	Anderson Cooper	Please respond.
1089	Kamala Harris	Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today.
1090	Kamala Harris	During the course of this debate, eight people will die from gun violence.
1091	Kamala Harris	The leading cause of death of young black men in America is gun violence, more than the top other six reasons totaled.
1092	Kamala Harris	This is a serious matter.
1093	Kamala Harris	I have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you.
1094	Kamala Harris	I have looked at more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you.
1095	Kamala Harris	I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you.
1096	Kamala Harris	I’m done, and we need action, and Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage.
1097	Kamala Harris	When I’m elected, I’ll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature and if they don’t, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country, because it is time to act.
1098	Anderson Cooper	Vice President Biden, your response.
1099	Joe Biden	I’m the only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them, and beat them twice.
1100	Joe Biden	We were able to get assault weapons off the streets and not be able to be sold for 10 years.
1101	Joe Biden	Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred.
1102	Joe Biden	The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that people own is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns.
1103	Joe Biden	You must register that weapon.
1104	Joe Biden	You must register it.
1105	Joe Biden	When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially.
1106	Joe Biden	I’m the only one that moved to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it.
1107	Joe Biden	I’ve done this.
1108	Joe Biden	I know how to get it done.
1109	Joe Biden	If you really want to get it done, go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued.
1110	Joe Biden	That will [crosstalk 01:42:27].
1111	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
1112	Anderson Cooper	Mr. Vice President.
1113	Anderson Cooper	Secretary Castro, the vast majority of homicides committed with a gun in this country are from hand guns, not assault style weapons.
1114	Anderson Cooper	What’s your plan to prevent those deaths?
1115	Julian Castro	Thank you very much for the question.
1116	Julian Castro	You know, I grew up in neighborhoods where it wasn’t uncommon to hear gunshots at night, and I can remember ducking into the back seat of a car when I was a freshman in high school, across the street from my school, my public school, because folks were shooting at each other.
1117	Julian Castro	You know, in the neighborhoods … Let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory.
1118	Julian Castro	There are two problems I have with mandatory buybacks.
1119	Julian Castro	Number one, folks can’t define it, and if you’re not going to door door to door, then it’s not really mandatory.
1120	Julian Castro	But also, in the places that I grew up in, we weren’t exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door.
1121	Julian Castro	And y’all saw a couple of days ago what happened to Tatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth.
1122	Julian Castro	Cops showed up at 2:00 in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew.
1123	Julian Castro	He didn’t even announce himself, and within four seconds he shot her and killed her through her home window.
1124	Julian Castro	She was in her own home.
1125	Julian Castro	And so I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that.
1126	Anderson Cooper	Senator Castro, thank you.
1127	Marc Lacey	Turning to another key issue here in Ohio and around the country, the opioid epidemic.
1128	Marc Lacey	Senator Klobuchar, CNN reached out to Ohio Democratic voters for their most pressing questions.
1129	Marc Lacey	Bri, a teacher in Proctorville asks, ” In rural Ohio, the opioid epidemic has effected our communities and schools.
1130	Marc Lacey	I have many high school students who have lost one or both parents to heroin.
1131	Marc Lacey	Teachers are on the front lines daily witnessing these tragedies.
1132	Marc Lacey	How will you tackle this problem in general, but specifically, what will you offer people in rural communities where rehabilitation is not easily accessed and access to jobs is difficult?”
1133	Amy Klobuchar	Well, I want to thank her for this question.
1134	Amy Klobuchar	This is something that should never have happened to begin with.
1135	Amy Klobuchar	I remember when I was a prosecutor, these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door.
1136	Amy Klobuchar	And it’s gotten worse and worse and we now know why.
1137	Amy Klobuchar	As the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits, probably one of the most horrible things that I saw was the email from one of the pharma executives that actually said, “Keep pumping them out.
1138	Amy Klobuchar	They’re eating them like Doritos.”
1139	Amy Klobuchar	So my first answer to that question, and which is included in my plan, is that the people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment, are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place.
1140	Amy Klobuchar	And that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids.
1141	Amy Klobuchar	That’s the first way.
1142	Amy Klobuchar	You can, with a 2 cents per milligram tax, bring in the money, plus with the federal master settlement, to help in rural areas where they’re so isolated, and also in urban areas where it’s, by the way, not just opioids, there are still meth issues and crack cocaine issues.
1143	Amy Klobuchar	This is personal for me.
1144	Amy Klobuchar	My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life, and by his third DWI they said to him, the prosecutor, “You’ve got to face jail or you’ve got to go to treatment.” He picked treatment and he was pursued by grace.
1145	Amy Klobuchar	He has been sober ever since, and now he’s 91 and in assisted living.
1146	Amy Klobuchar	He said to me last year, “It’s hard to get a drink around here, anyway.” But he still has an AA group that visits him there.
1147	Amy Klobuchar	And so for me, I believe that everyone in this country, including the people in rural America, have that same right to be pursued by grace.
1148	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
1149	Marc Lacey	Mr Steyer, how would you address the opioid epidemic that exists here in Ohio and around the country?
1150	Marc Lacey	Please respond.
1151	Tom Steyer	Well, I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America’s had.
1152	Tom Steyer	72,000 people died of opioid overdoses last year, and that’s not only a tragedy for them, it’s a tragedy for their family and their communities.
1153	Tom Steyer	And so I think we have to treat this as a health crisis.
1154	Tom Steyer	We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people, but I think that Senator Klobuchar makes a good point.
1155	Tom Steyer	The reason I’m running for president is that we have a broken government, and we have a broken government because corporations have bought it.
1156	Tom Steyer	Every single one of these conversations is about that broken government.
1157	Tom Steyer	It’s about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want.
1158	Tom Steyer	It’s about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want.
1159	Tom Steyer	We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government.
1160	Tom Steyer	I’ve put forward actual structural changes, including term limits, a national referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically and make it a lot easier to vote.
1161	Tom Steyer	These corporations have taken over our government, and 72,000 deaths this year are the tragic result.
1162	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
1163	Marc Lacey	Mr. Yang, you want to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of opioids, including heroin.
1164	Marc Lacey	How would that solve the crisis?
1165	Andrew Yang	That’s exactly right, and we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amuck.
1166	Andrew Yang	There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio, and for some reason the federal government thought that was appropriate.
1167	Andrew Yang	They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money until you realize that company made $30 billion.
1168	Andrew Yang	They got a 2% fine and they killed tens of thousands of Americans an hour.
1169	Andrew Yang	So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities so our people have a fighting chance to get well.
1170	Andrew Yang	Even though this is not a money problem, we all know this is a human problem.
1171	Andrew Yang	Part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they’re not going to be referred to a prison cell, they will be referred to treatment and counseling.
1172	Andrew Yang	I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again, because the fact is after you save someone who’s ODing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week.
1173	Andrew Yang	So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use.
1174	Andrew Yang	We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing, this was a systemic government failing, and then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country because they save lives.
1175	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Mr. Yang.
1176	Marc Lacey	Congressman O’Rourke, is decriminalizing opioids part of the solution?
1177	Marc Lacey	Please respond.
1178	Beto O’Rourke	Yes, it is, for many of the reasons that Mr. Yang just described, and also just from some personal experiences I’ve had as a member of Congress where constituents of mine have come forward, in some cases publicly, at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions.
1179	Beto O’Rourke	I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the VA. Now imagine that veteran instead of being prescribed an opioid had been prescribed marijuana, because we made that legal in America, insured the VA could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who have been arrested for possession, and made sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted.
1180	Beto O’Rourke	I also want to agree with Senator Klobuchar.
1181	Beto O’Rourke	Until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, we’re going to continue to have this problem going on again.
1182	Beto O’Rourke	So, that veteran that I met, and anyone with drug addiction today, is not a problem for the criminal justice system.
1183	Beto O’Rourke	They’re an opportunity for our public health system [crosstalk 01:49:50]-
1184	Marc Lacey	Senator Harris, you want to hold the drug manufacturers that fueled the crisis accountable.
1185	Marc Lacey	Are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to jail?
1186	Kamala Harris	I am, and I will tell you as a former prosecutor, I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability, because they are nothing more than some high level dope dealers.
1187	Kamala Harris	They have been engaged … and I’ve seen it happen before.
1188	Kamala Harris	I’ve taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was Attorney General of California and led the second largest Department of Justice.
1189	Kamala Harris	I’ve seen what they do.
1190	Kamala Harris	The eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies, last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic.
1191	Kamala Harris	And they knew what they were doing.
1192	Kamala Harris	They were marketing false advertising.
1193	Kamala Harris	They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks.
1194	Kamala Harris	And yes, they should be held accountable.
1195	Kamala Harris	This is a matter of justice.
1196	Kamala Harris	And so as as President of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department Of Justice understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal, let’s end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs and let’s go after these pharmaceutical companies for what they’ve been doing to destroy our country in States like Ohio.
1197	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator.
1198	Marc Lacey	Secretary Castro, are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to prison?
1199	Marc Lacey	Please respond.
1200	Julian Castro	Yes, I am.
1201	Julian Castro	They need to be held accountable, not only financially, but also criminal penalties.
1202	Julian Castro	You know, you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable, whether it’s these drug manufacturers or Wall Street executives that should have been held accountable a decade and a half ago.
1203	Marc Lacey	Thank you.
1204	Erin Burnett	Now to the issue of candidates and their health.
1205	Erin Burnett	Senator Sanders, I want to start with you.
1206	Erin Burnett	I want to start … We’re moving on, Senator, I’m sorry.
1207	Bernie Sanders	I’m healthy.
1208	Bernie Sanders	I’m feeling great.
1209	Bernie Sanders	But I would like to respond to that question.
1210	Erin Burnett	I want to start by saying …
1211	Senator Booker	And Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana.
1212	Senator Booker	I want to make sure that’s clear, as well.
1213	Bernie Sanders	Thank you.
1214	Erin Burnett	Senator Sanders, this debate does mark your-
1215	Bernie Sanders	I’m not on it tonight.
1216	Bernie Sanders	[crosstalk 01:52:17]-
1217	Erin Burnett	… this debate, sir, does mark your return to the campaign trail.
1218	Erin Burnett	Go ahead and finish your point and then I’ll ask my question, Senator.
1219	Bernie Sanders	I’m more than happy to answer your question, but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Cory and others have said.
1220	Bernie Sanders	Let’s take a deep breath, take a look at this opioid epidemic.
1221	Bernie Sanders	You have the executive CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies making tens of millions of dollars a year, and in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them.
1222	Bernie Sanders	Last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit.
1223	Bernie Sanders	This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country, and it’s not just the drug companies.
1224	Bernie Sanders	Right now, the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world, and they continue to make huge profits.
1225	Erin Burnett	Senator-
1226	Bernie Sanders	That is why we need a political revolution-
1227	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator.
1228	Bernie Sanders	… that says enough is enough to this behavior.
1229	Erin Burnett	Senator, we are all very glad you’re feeling well, as you’ve just said, but there is a question on a lot of people’s minds and I want to address it tonight.
1230	Erin Burnett	You’re 78 years old and you just had a heart attack.
1231	Erin Burnett	How do you reassure Democratic voters that you’re up to the stress of the presidency?
1232	Bernie Sanders	Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we’re having in Queens, New York, berniesanders.com.
1233	Bernie Sanders	We’re going to have a special guest at that event and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country.
1234	Bernie Sanders	That is how I think I can reassure the American people.
1235	Bernie Sanders	But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes.
1236	Bernie Sanders	I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.
1237	Erin Burnett	Vice President Biden, if you’re elected you will turn 80 during your first term.
1238	Erin Burnett	Last month, former President Jimmy Carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old.
1239	Erin Burnett	Why are you so sure that you can?
1240	Joe Biden	Because I’ve watched it, I know what the job is, I’ve been engaged.
1241	Joe Biden	Look, one of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience.
1242	Joe Biden	With it, comes wisdom.
1243	Joe Biden	We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.
1244	Joe Biden	It is required now, more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on day one.
1245	Joe Biden	That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because of I know what has to be done, I’ve done it before, I’ve been there.
1246	Joe Biden	When we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history, I’ve been there.
1247	Joe Biden	And I’ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act which kept us from going into depression.
1248	Joe Biden	I know what has to be done.
1249	Joe Biden	I will not need any on the job training the day I take office, and I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.
1250	Erin Burnett	Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?
1251	Joe Biden	Before the first vote.
1252	Erin Burnett	Before Iowa?
1253	Joe Biden	Yes.
1254	Erin Burnett	Not by the end of this year?
1255	Joe Biden	Before Iowa.
1256	Joe Biden	I mean, look, I’ve released them before.
1257	Joe Biden	I released 55 pages of my … I’m the only guy that’s released anything up here.
1258	Erin Burnett	Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated on a first term.
1259	Erin Burnett	You’ll be 71.
1260	Erin Burnett	40% of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump.
1261	Erin Burnett	What do you say to them?
1262	Senator Warren	Well, I say I will out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.
1263	Senator Warren	Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind.
1264	Senator Warren	Political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that.
1265	Senator Warren	They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy.
1266	Senator Warren	They are wrong.
1267	Senator Warren	If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose.
1268	Senator Warren	Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it, Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people’s lives, things like childcare and healthcare and housing costs, Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.
1269	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Senator warren.
1270	Erin Burnett	Congresswoman Gabbard, you’re 38 years old and you would be the youngest president if elected.
1271	Erin Burnett	Should age matter when choosing a president?
1272	Tulsi Gabbard	I’m glad you asked, because I was going to say it’s not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as president, but not every other one of us.
1273	Tulsi Gabbard	I am grateful to have been trained very well by the army and do my best to stay in shape, but here’s the real question I believe you should be asking, is who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief?
1274	Tulsi Gabbard	This is the most important responsibility that the president has.
1275	Tulsi Gabbard	What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like it.
1276	Tulsi Gabbard	It highlights how critical is that we have a president and commander-in-chief who’s ready on day one, bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security.
1277	Tulsi Gabbard	Bringing the experience that I have both serving in Congress now for nearly seven years, serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, serving on the Armed Services Committee, subcommittee’s related to terrorism and upcoming threats, serving on the Homeland Security Committee.
1278	Tulsi Gabbard	The experience that I have as a soldier, serving for over 16 years in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, being able to serve in different capacities, joint training exercises, training the Kuwait National Guard.
1279	Tulsi Gabbard	I understand the importance of our national security.
1280	Tulsi Gabbard	I am prepared to do this job to fulfill this responsibility as commander-in-chief on day one.
1281	Erin Burnett	Thank you, Congresswoman.
1282	Tulsi Gabbard	I’d like to ask our other candidates this question, I’d like to start with Senator Warren-
1283	Erin Burnett	Sorry, Congresswoman.
1284	Erin Burnett	I’m sorry.
1285	Tulsi Gabbard	… what her experience and background is to serve as commander-in-chief?
1286	Erin Burnett	I’m sorry.
1287	Erin Burnett	Thank you.
1288	Erin Burnett	We’re going to take another break now.
1289	Erin Burnett	The CNN New York Times Debate live from Otterbein University here in Ohio.
1290	Erin Burnett	We’ll be back in just a few moments.
1291	Anderson Cooper	Welcome back to the CNN New York Times Democratic Presidential Debate.
1292	Anderson Cooper	Marc Lacey from the New York Times starts off our questioning.
1293	Anderson Cooper	Marc.
1294	Marc Lacey	Thank you.
1295	Marc Lacey	Let’s turn to the growing concerns over the power of big tech companies.
1296	Marc Lacey	Mr. Yang, Senator Warren is calling for companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google to be broken up.
1297	Marc Lacey	Is she right?
1298	Marc Lacey	Does that need to happen?
1299	Andrew Yang	As usual, Senator Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem.
1300	Andrew Yang	There are absolutely excesses in technology, and in some cases, having them divest parts of their business is the right move, but we also have to be realistic that competition doesn’t solve all of the problems.
1301	Andrew Yang	It’s not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app, that would be like [inaudible 00:29:09].
1302	Andrew Yang	There’s a reason why no one is using Bing today.
1303	Andrew Yang	Sorry, Microsoft, it’s true.
1304	Andrew Yang	So it’s not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive main street businesses around the country.
1305	Andrew Yang	And as the parent of two young children, I’m particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children.
1306	Andrew Yang	Studies clearly show that we’re seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.
1307	Andrew Yang	Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier.
1308	Andrew Yang	What we have to do is we have to home in on the specific problems we’re trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems.
1309	Andrew Yang	Using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work.
1310	Andrew Yang	We need new solutions and a new toolkit.
1311	Marc Lacey	Thank you.
1312	Marc Lacey	Senator Warren, is Mr. Yang wrong?
1313	Marc Lacey	Your response, please.
1314	Senator Warren	Look, I’m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy.
1315	Senator Warren	It’s time to fight back.
1316	Senator Warren	Think about it this way.
1317	Senator Warren	When you talk about how it works in competition, about 8%, 9% of all retail sales happen in bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart.
1318	Senator Warren	About 49% of all sales online happen in one place.
1319	Senator Warren	That’s Amazon.
1320	Senator Warren	It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else.
1321	Senator Warren	It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses.
1322	Senator Warren	Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game or you get to have a team, but you don’t get to do both at the same time.
1323	Senator Warren	We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them.
1324	Marc Lacey	Thank you, Senator Warren.
1325	Marc Lacey	Mr. Steyer, your response.
1326	Tom Steyer	Look, I agree with Senator Warren that in fact monopolies have to be dealt with.
1327	Tom Steyer	They either have to be broken up or regulated, and that’s part of it, but we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy.
1328	Tom Steyer	He’s going to be saying he’s the person who can make it grow.
1329	Tom Steyer	I started a business from scratch, one room, no employers, and built a multi-billion dollar international business.
1330	Tom Steyer	We’re going to have to show the American people that we don’t just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies, but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector.
1331	Tom Steyer	In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump, I think somebody who can go toe to toe with them and show them to be a fraud and a failure as a business person, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy, is going to be necessary.
1332	Tom Steyer	He is one.
1333	Tom Steyer	His tax plan’s a failure.
1334	Tom Steyer	His trade war is a failure.
1335	Tom Steyer	I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show-
1336	Tom Steyer	… I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that in fact he’s failed the American people and he has to go.
1337	Marc Lacey	Thank you Mr. Steyer.
1338	Marc Lacey	Senator Booker how do you respond?
1339	Marc Lacey	Would a President Booker break up big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon?
1340	Senator Booker	Anybody that does not think that we hae a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy.
1341	Senator Booker	We have seen it in the ’16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now.
1342	Senator Booker	We need regulation and reform.
1343	Senator Booker	Antitrust, I mean Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep.
1344	Senator Booker	We have a reality in this country where antitrust, from pharma to farms, is causing trouble.
1345	Senator Booker	We have to deal with this.
1346	Senator Booker	As president of the United States I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws.
1347	Senator Booker	I want to say one last thing, and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage, going back to the fact that we … It’s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.
1348	Marc Lacey	Thank you Senator.
1349	Marc Lacey	Congressman O’Rourke you say you’re not sure if it’s appropriate for a president to designate which companies should be broken up.
1350	Marc Lacey	What’s the proper level of oversight here?
1351	Beto O’Rourke	Yeah.
1352	Beto O’Rourke	We need to set very tough, very clear transparent rules of the road.
1353	Beto O’Rourke	The kind of rules that we do not have today.
1354	Beto O’Rourke	That allow these social media platforms, where we the people have become the product, to abuse that public trust.
1355	Beto O’Rourke	To do so at extraordinary profits.
1356	Beto O’Rourke	Right now we treat them functionally as a utility.
1357	Beto O’Rourke	When in reality they’re more akin to a publisher.
1358	Beto O’Rourke	They curate the content that we see.
1359	Beto O’Rourke	Our pictures and personal information that they share with others.
1360	Beto O’Rourke	We would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing.
1361	Beto O’Rourke	To publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the Vice President.
1362	Beto O’Rourke	Treat them like the publisher that they are.
1363	Beto O’Rourke	That’s what I will do as president.
1364	Beto O’Rourke	We will be unafraid to breakup big businesses if we have to do that.
1365	Beto O’Rourke	But I don’t think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up.
1366	Beto O’Rourke	That’s something that Donald Trump has done.
1367	Beto O’Rourke	In part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power.
1368	Beto O’Rourke	It’s not something that we should do.
1369	Beto O’Rourke	Tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy and data.
1370	Beto O’Rourke	Be fearless in the face of these tech giants.
1371	Marc Lacey	Senator Sanders your response?
1372	Bernie Sanders	When we talk about a rigged economy it’s not just the grotesque level of income in wealth and equality.
1373	Bernie Sanders	It is also the fact that in sector after sector, whether it is Wall Street where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States; whether it is media where you have 10 media companies that control about 90% of what the American people see, hear or read; whether it is agribusiness where we see merger after merger, which is resulting in the decline of family based farming in this country, we need a president who has the guts to appoint an Attorney General who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price fixing which we see every day.
1374	Marc Lacey	Thank you Senator.
1375	Kamala Harris	Marc.
1376	Kamala Harris	Marc.
1377	Marc Lacey	Thank you Senator.
1378	Marc Lacey	Senator Harris to you.
1379	Marc Lacey	Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that splitting up big tech companies will make election interference more likely because the companies won’t be able to work together to fight it.
1380	Marc Lacey	Could breaking up these companies make the spread of disinformation worse?
1381	Kamala Harris	No I don’t agree with that at all.
1382	Kamala Harris	As serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee, working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure, knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again, that’s a ridiculous argument he’s making.
1383	Kamala Harris	But I do want to also say this.
1384	Kamala Harris	What we’re talking about is a grave injustice.
1385	Kamala Harris	When rules apply to some but not equally to all.
1386	Kamala Harris	In particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don’t apply to the powerful.
1387	Kamala Harris	Senator Warren I just want to say that I was surprised to here that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies.
1388	Kamala Harris	When I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump’s account that you did not agree.
1389	Kamala Harris	I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice.
1390	Kamala Harris	He and his account should be taken down.
1391	Kamala Harris	We saw in El Paso that that shooter, in his manifesto, was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform.
1392	Kamala Harris	This is a matter of corporate responsibility.
1393	Kamala Harris	Twitter should be held accountable and shutdown that site.
1394	Kamala Harris	It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.
1395	Marc Lacey	Thank you.
1396	Marc Lacey	Senator Warren you can respond.
1397	Senator Warren	Look I don’t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter.
1398	Senator Warren	I want to push him out of The White House.
1399	Senator Warren	That’s our job.
1400	Senator Warren	But the way-
1401	Kamala Harris	Then join me if you don’t-
1402	Senator Warren	But the way … But let’s figure-
1403	Kamala Harris	Join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.
1404	Senator Warren	No.
1405	Senator Warren	Let’s figure out-
1406	Kamala Harris	No?
1407	Senator Warren	… why it is that we have had laws on the book-
1408	Kamala Harris	Wow.
1409	Senator Warren	… for antitrust for over a century.
1410	Senator Warren	Yet for decades now we’ve all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, Big Ag, how the gun industry, big tech.
1411	Senator Warren	We really need to address the elephant in the room and that is how campaigns are financed.
1412	Kamala Harris	You can’t say you’re for corporate-
1413	Senator Warren	I announced this morning-
1414	Kamala Harris	… responsibility if it doesn’t apply to everyone.
1415	Senator Warren	I announced this morning that I’m not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives.
1416	Senator Warren	We’ve already agreed Bernie and I, we’re not taking any money from big pharma executives.
1417	Senator Warren	You can’t go behind closed doors, and take the money of these executives, and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws.
1418	Senator Warren	We need campaign finance rules and practices-
1419	Marc Lacey	Thank you Senator Warren.
1420	Senator Warren	[crosstalk 02:14:24] … that support us all.
1421	Kamala Harris	It does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people.
1422	Kamala Harris	This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable.
1423	Senator Warren	Yes.
1424	Kamala Harris	Holding big tech accountable because they have an out-sized influence on people’s perceptions about issues.
1425	Kamala Harris	They actually influence behaviors.
1426	Kamala Harris	We all have to agree this is their power, it is immense.
1427	Marc Lacey	[crosstalk 02:14:53] Senator Klobuchar let me bring you in-
1428	Kamala Harris	[crosstalk 02:14:55] I’m not finished.
1429	Kamala Harris	[crosstalk 02:14:57] I’m not finished.
1430	Kamala Harris	What I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.
1431	Senator Warren	Look I think all of the rules should apply across the board.
1432	Senator Warren	I don’t have a problem with that.
1433	Kamala Harris	So you will join me in saying-
1434	Senator Warren	What I do have a problem with-
1435	Kamala Harris	… Twitter should shutdown that account?
1436	Senator Warren	… is that if we’re going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives.
1437	Senator Warren	I we’re going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives.
1438	Senator Warren	If we are going to talk about Wall Street, and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.
1439	Marc Lacey	Thank you.
1440	Senator Warren	So long as that’s-
1441	Marc Lacey	Senator Klobuchar [crosstalk 02:15:49] let’s bring you in here.
1442	Amy Klobuchar	[crosstalk 02:15:49] I would like to have a different take on this.
1443	Amy Klobuchar	I was in the private sector for 14 years.
1444	Amy Klobuchar	Represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom market.
1445	Amy Klobuchar	I had a life before government.
1446	Amy Klobuchar	What I saw was when we got more competition there the prices went down in a big way, in the long-distance market.
1447	Amy Klobuchar	Well right now we have another gilded age going on.
1448	Amy Klobuchar	I am the lead Democrat on the Antitrust Committee.
1449	Amy Klobuchar	I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we’ve been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation.
1450	Amy Klobuchar	Also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they’re so overwhelmed.
1451	Amy Klobuchar	But the issue here is this, start talking about this as a pro competition issue.
1452	Amy Klobuchar	This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue because America, our founding fathers, actually wanted to have less consolidation.
1453	Amy Klobuchar	We were a place of entrepreneurship.
1454	Amy Klobuchar	We are seeing a startup slump in this country-
1455	Marc Lacey	Thank you Senator.
1456	Amy Klobuchar	… and this means-
1457	Marc Lacey	Secretary Castro would you like to-
1458	Amy Klobuchar	… everything from tech on down.
1459	Marc Lacey	… weigh in please respond.
1460	Julian Castro	Yeah.
1461	Julian Castro	I think that we’re on the right track, in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices.
1462	Julian Castro	Setting, as Congressman O’Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today.
1463	Julian Castro	Whether that’s Amazon that is leveraging its size, I think, to help put small businesses out of business.
1464	Julian Castro	Then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers.
1465	Julian Castro	Not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits that they should.
1466	Julian Castro	Or it’s a number of other companies, big tech companies.
1467	Julian Castro	We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices.
1468	Julian Castro	That’s what I would do as president.
1469	Marc Lacey	Thank you Mr. Secretary.
1470	Andrew Yang	[crosstalk 02:17:32] That’s the way we can fight back.
1471	Andrew Yang	[crosstalk 02:17:34] The best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property.
1472	Andrew Yang	Right now our data is worth more than oil.
1473	Andrew Yang	How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail?
1474	Andrew Yang	It got lost.
1475	Andrew Yang	It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google.
1476	Andrew Yang	If we say this is our property and we share in the gains that’s the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies.
1477	Erin Burnett	Thank you Mr. Yang.
1478	Kamala Harris	There’s a bigger issue here.
1479	Erin Burnett	Turning to women’s reproductive rights.
1480	Erin Burnett	Ohio is now one of several states that has banned abortions after as early as six weeks of pregnancy.
1481	Erin Burnett	Many women don’t even know they are pregnant at that time.
1482	Erin Burnett	The Ohio law, like many others, is being challenged in the courts and has not yet taken effect.
1483	Erin Burnett	Senator Harris if states prevail on restricting abortion what’s your plan to stop them?
1484	Kamala Harris	My plan is as follows, for any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution, and in particular Roe v. Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution.
1485	Kamala Harris	If it is not that law will not go into affect.
1486	Kamala Harris	That’s called pre-clearance.
1487	Kamala Harris	Because the reality is that while we still have, as I said earlier, these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be accountability and consequence.
1488	Kamala Harris	But I’ll go further.
1489	Kamala Harris	You may have seen I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
1490	Kamala Harris	Asked him, as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court, could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body?
1491	Kamala Harris	The answer was, “Uh, uh, no.” The reality of it is this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America.
1492	Kamala Harris	Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species.
1493	Kamala Harris	Our bodies were created to do that.
1494	Kamala Harris	It does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body.
1495	Kamala Harris	It is her body, it is her right, it is her decision.
1496	Erin Burnett	Senator Harris thank you.
1497	Erin Burnett	Senator Klobuchar, what would you do to stop states from prevailing?
1498	Erin Burnett	Your response?
1499	Amy Klobuchar	I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land.
1500	Amy Klobuchar	But what I want to do right now is just say what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me?
1501	Amy Klobuchar	You know what I would say to him?
1502	Amy Klobuchar	I’d say, “You know you said you wanted to do this.
1503	Amy Klobuchar	In your race for president you actually said that you wanted to put women in jail.
1504	Amy Klobuchar	Then you tried to dial it back and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail.
1505	Amy Klobuchar	That is exactly what the Alabama law is.
1506	Amy Klobuchar	It put doctors in jail for 99 years.
1507	Amy Klobuchar	You Donald Trump are not on the side of women.
1508	Amy Klobuchar	You are not on the side of people of this country when over 75% of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book.
1509	Amy Klobuchar	When over 90% of people want to make sure we have available contraception.
1510	Amy Klobuchar	You defunded Planned Parenthood.
1511	Amy Klobuchar	I would fund it again.”
1512	Erin Burnett	Senator thank you.
1513	Erin Burnett	Senator Booker, if states prevail on restricting abortion how would you stop them?
1514	Erin Burnett	Please respond.
1515	Senator Booker	Well first of all let’s be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio, they’re not just a tax on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country liberty, the ability to control your own body, but they are particular another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty.
1516	Senator Booker	Because this is disproportionately affecting low income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country.
1517	Senator Booker	It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal, that human beings should control their own body.
1518	Senator Booker	The way, as president of the United States, I’m going to deal with this is first of all elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House level position.
1519	Senator Booker	I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in The White House.
1520	Senator Booker	Make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt, that’s gone on for decades, to undermine Roe v. Wade.
1521	Senator Booker	I will fight to codify it.
1522	Senator Booker	I will also make sure that we fight, as this country, to repeal the Hyde Amendment so that we are leading the planet Earth in defending the global-
1523	Erin Burnett	Thank you Senator.
1524	Senator Booker	… assault we see on women right now.
1525	Erin Burnett	Congresswoman Gabbard your response?
1526	Tulsi Gabbard	This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make.
1527	Tulsi Gabbard	It’s unfortunate to see how, in this country, it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon.
1528	Tulsi Gabbard	I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare I think she’s correct.
1529	Tulsi Gabbard	We see how the consequences of laws that you’re referring to can often lead to a dangerous place.
1530	Tulsi Gabbard	As we’ve seen them, as they’re passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage passed that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point.
1531	Tulsi Gabbard	I do however think that there should be some restrictions in place.
1532	Tulsi Gabbard	I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that during the third trimester abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.
1533	Erin Burnett	Thank you very much.
1534	Erin Burnett	The Supreme Court is currently made up of five Republican appointed justices and four appointed by Democrats.
1535	Erin Burnett	The Court just announced it will hear arguments in a case challenging some abortion rights.
1536	Erin Burnett	Vice President Biden the Constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the Supreme Court.
1537	Erin Burnett	If Roe v. Wade is overturned on your watch, and you can’t pass legislation in Congress, would you seek to add justices to the Supreme Court to protect women’s reproductive rights?
1538	Joe Biden	I would not get in a Court [pecking 02:23:13].
1539	Joe Biden	We had three justices, next time around we lose control they had three justices.
1540	Joe Biden	We began to lose any credibility the Court has at all.
1541	Joe Biden	I want to point out that the justices I’ve supported … When I defeated Robert Bork and I say when I defeated Robert Bork I made sure we guaranteed a woman’s right to chose for a better part of a generation.
1542	Joe Biden	I would make sure that we move and insist that we codify Roe v. Wade.
1543	Joe Biden	The public is already there.
1544	Joe Biden	Things have changed.
1545	Joe Biden	I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, et cetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier.
1546	Joe Biden	Reproductive rights are a constitutional right.
1547	Joe Biden	In fact every woman should have that right.
1548	Joe Biden	I would not pack the Court.
1549	Joe Biden	What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the Court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they in fact support the right of privacy.
1550	Joe Biden	On which the entire notion of a woman’s right to choose is based.
1551	Joe Biden	That’s what I would do.
1552	Joe Biden	No one would get on the Court …
1553	Joe Biden	By the way, if in fact at the end of this … The beginning of next year, if in fact one of the justices steps down, God forbid, in fact I would make sure that we would do exactly what McConnell did last time out.
1554	Joe Biden	We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.
1555	Erin Burnett	Thank you Mr. Vice President.
1556	Erin Burnett	Mayor Buttigieg you have discussed expanding the Court from nine to 15 justices.
1557	Erin Burnett	What’s your response to the Vice President?
1558	Pete Buttigieg	That’s right.
1559	Pete Buttigieg	When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate.
1560	Pete Buttigieg	Now I’m not talking about packing the Court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values.
1561	Pete Buttigieg	For example the idea that women’s reproductive freedom is an American right.
1562	Pete Buttigieg	What I’m talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the Court.
1563	Pete Buttigieg	We can’t go on like this, where every single time there is a vacancy we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next.
1564	Pete Buttigieg	Now one way to fix this would be to have a 15 member Court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10.
1565	Pete Buttigieg	Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal on how this could be done without a constitutional amendment.
1566	Pete Buttigieg	But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis.
1567	Pete Buttigieg	There are other reforms that we could consider.
1568	Pete Buttigieg	From term limits, don’t forget justices used to just retire like everybody else, to a rotation off the appellate bench.
1569	Erin Burnett	Thank you.
1570	Pete Buttigieg	I’m not wedded to a particular solution but I am committed to establishing a commission on day one-
1571	Erin Burnett	Thank you Mayor Buttigieg.
1572	Pete Buttigieg	… that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court because we can’t go on like this.
1573	Erin Burnett	Thank you very much Mayor Buttigieg.
1574	Erin Burnett	Secretary Castro he’s talking about making the Court bigger.
1575	Erin Burnett	Your response?
1576	Erin Burnett	Is it a good idea?
1577	Julian Castro	I don’t think it is.
1578	Julian Castro	I wouldn’t pack the Court.
1579	Julian Castro	I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe if we were selecting from one of those things that the smarter move might be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts.
1580	Julian Castro	So that you would have a replenishment of perspective.
1581	Julian Castro	I would also make sure that I appoint, as president, people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade.
1582	Julian Castro	That we codify Roe v. Wade.
1583	Julian Castro	That we do away with things like the Hyde Amendment because you shouldn’t only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money.
1584	Julian Castro	We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor.
1585	Julian Castro	We have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom but also reproductive justice.
1586	Julian Castro	Invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her healthcare needs met.
1587	Erin Burnett	Senator Warren would you consider adding more justices to the Supreme Court to protect Roe v. Wade?
1588	Erin Burnett	Your response?
1589	Senator Warren	I think there are a number of options.
1590	Senator Warren	I think as Mayor Buttigieg said there are many different ways.
1591	Senator Warren	People are talking about different options.
1592	Senator Warren	I think we may have to talk about them.
1593	Senator Warren	But on Roe versus Wade can we just pause for a minute here.
1594	Senator Warren	I lived in an America where abortion was illegal.
1595	Senator Warren	Rich women still got abortions because they could travel, they could go to places where it was legal.
1596	Senator Warren	What we’re talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are 14 year olds who were molested by a family member.
1597	Senator Warren	We now have support across this country.
1598	Senator Warren	Three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe versus Wade.
1599	Senator Warren	When you’ve got three out of four Americans supporting it we should be able to get that passed through Congress.
1600	Erin Burnett	Senator thank you.
1601	Senator Warren	We should not leave this to the Supreme Court we should do it through democracy because we can.
1602	Erin Burnett	Thank you very much Senator.
1603	Anderson Cooper	As some of you have indicated the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump.
1604	Anderson Cooper	There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage.
1605	Anderson Cooper	Vice President Biden just on either side of you Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.
1606	Anderson Cooper	Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?
1607	Joe Biden	Well I think there vision is attracting a lot of people.
1608	Joe Biden	I think a lot of what they have to say is really important.
1609	Joe Biden	But as Senator Warren said, “We can’t be running any vague campaigns.” We got to level with people.
1610	Joe Biden	We’ve got to level with people and tell them exactly what we’re going to do, how we’re going to get it done.
1611	Joe Biden	If you can get it done.
1612	Joe Biden	I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.
1613	Joe Biden	From the Violence Against Women Act, to making sure that we passed the Affordable Care Act, to be in a position where we in fact took almost a 90 billion dollar act that kept us from going into a depression, putting us in a position where I was able to end Roe … Excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales, in terms of assault weapons.
1614	Joe Biden	The question is who is best prepared?
1615	Joe Biden	We all have good ideas.
1616	Joe Biden	The question is who’s going to be able to get it done?
1617	Joe Biden	How can you get it done?
1618	Joe Biden	I’m not suggesting they can’t but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at.
1619	Joe Biden	Part of that requires you not being vague.
1620	Joe Biden	Tell people what it’s going to cost, how you’re going to do it, and why you’re going to do it.
1621	Joe Biden	That’s the way to get it done.
1622	Joe Biden	Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.
1623	Anderson Cooper	Just to clarify Vice President, who are you saying is being vague?
1624	Joe Biden	Well the senator said … She’s being vague on the issue of … Actually both of them are being vague on the issue of the Medicare for all.
1625	Joe Biden	Now look, here’s the deal, come on it costs 30 trillion dollars.
1626	Joe Biden	Guess what?
1627	Joe Biden	That’s over three trillion dollars a year.
1628	Joe Biden	It’s part of the entire budget.
1629	Joe Biden	Let me finish, okay?
1630	Anderson Cooper	You’ll both get a …
1631	Joe Biden	If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing.
1632	Joe Biden	Planes, ship, troop, the building, everything, satellites, it would get you and pay for a total of four months.
1633	Joe Biden	Four months.
1634	Joe Biden	Where do you get the rest?
1635	Joe Biden	Where’s it come from?
1636	Bernie Sanders	Two things.
1637	Bernie Sanders	Let me respond-
1638	Anderson Cooper	Senator Sanders respond.
1639	Bernie Sanders	… in two ways.
1640	Bernie Sanders	Joe you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done.
1641	Bernie Sanders	But you know what you also got done?
1642	Bernie Sanders	I say this as a good friend.
1643	Bernie Sanders	You got the disastrous war in Iraq done.
1644	Bernie Sanders	You got a bankruptcy bill which is hurting middle class families all over this country.
1645	Bernie Sanders	You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done which have cost us four million jobs.
1646	Bernie Sanders	Now let’s get to Medicare for all.
1647	Bernie Sanders	Let’s be honest.
1648	Bernie Sanders	We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth.
1649	Bernie Sanders	The answer is if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies, and the insurance companies, and tell them that the function of healthcare is the guaranteed care to all people.
1650	Bernie Sanders	Not to make 100 billion dollars in profit.
1651	Anderson Cooper	Senator.
1652	Anderson Cooper	Thank you Senator.
1653	Bernie Sanders	If we stood together we could create the greatest healthcare system in the world.
1654	Anderson Cooper	Vice President Biden you can respond and then Senator Warren.
1655	Joe Biden	We can do that without Medicare for all.
1656	Joe Biden	We can do that by adding a [crosstalk 02:31:22] public option.
1657	Joe Biden	We can.
1658	Bernie Sanders	No you can’t.
1659	Joe Biden	We can afford to do it.
1660	Joe Biden	We can afford-
1661	Bernie Sanders	You’ve got to take on the greed and the profiteering of the-
1662	Joe Biden	By the way-
1663	Bernie Sanders	… healthcare industry.
1664	Joe Biden	… the greed and the profiteering-
1665	Anderson Cooper	Let him respond.
1666	Joe Biden	Let me finish.
1667	Anderson Cooper	Vice President.
1668	Joe Biden	The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies, they are as much against my bill as they are anybody else’s.
1669	Joe Biden	They were strongly against Obamacare.
1670	Joe Biden	They know it cost them.
1671	Joe Biden	It’s going to take away the right of people to choose.
1672	Joe Biden	The 160 million people out there who’ve negotiated their health insurance and they want to keep it.
1673	Joe Biden	They should have a right to keep it.
1674	Anderson Cooper	Senator Warren your response?
1675	Senator Warren	You started this question with how you got something done.
1676	Senator Warren	Following the financial crash of 2008 I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people.
1677	Senator Warren	All of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, “Don’t even try because you will never get it passed.” Sure enough the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us, but we got that agency passed into law.
1678	Senator Warren	It has now forced big banks to return more than 12 billion dollars directly to people they cheated.
1679	Senator Warren	I served in the Obama administration.
1680	Senator Warren	I know what we can do by executive authority and I will use it.
1681	Senator Warren	In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill which will beat back the influence of money-
1682	Anderson Cooper	Thank you Senator.
1683	Senator Warren	… and repeal the filibuster.
1684	Senator Warren	The third we want to get something done in America we have to get out there-
1685	Anderson Cooper	Thank you Senator.
1686	Senator Warren	… and fight for the things that touch people’s lives.
1687	Anderson Cooper	[crosstalk 02:32:52] Mayor-
1688	Joe Biden	I agreed with … Let me … She referenced me.
1689	Anderson Cooper	Okay.
1690	Joe Biden	I agreed with the great job she did.
1691	Joe Biden	I went on the floor and got you votes.
1692	Joe Biden	I got votes for that bill.
1693	Joe Biden	I convinced people for it, so let’s get those things straight too.
1694	Anderson Cooper	Senator Warren do you want to respond?
1695	Senator Warren	I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.
1696	Senator Warren	I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law, but understand-
1697	Joe Biden	You did a hell of a job in your job.
1698	Senator Warren	Thank you.
1699	Senator Warren	But understand this it was a dream big, fight hard.
1700	Senator Warren	People told me, “Go for something little.
1701	Senator Warren	Go for something small.
1702	Senator Warren	Go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept.”
1703	Anderson Cooper	Thank you Senator.
1704	Senator Warren	I said, “No.
1705	Senator Warren	Let’s go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.”
1706	Anderson Cooper	Senator thank you.
1707	Senator Warren	President Obama said, “I will fight for that.” He sometimes-
1708	Anderson Cooper	Mayor-
1709	Senator Warren	… had to fight against people in his own administration.
1710	Senator Warren	We have to-
1711	Joe Biden	Not me.
1712	Senator Warren	… be willing to make good-
1713	Anderson Cooper	Mayor-
1714	Senator Warren	… big structural change.
1715	Anderson Cooper	Mayor Buttigieg which is the right vision for a Democrat to beat Donald Trump?
1716	Anderson Cooper	That’s the essential question.
1717	Pete Buttigieg	If I had a buck for every argument that I’ve witnessed like this I could pay for college for everybody.
1718	Pete Buttigieg	We need to move passed what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I’ve been alive.
1719	Pete Buttigieg	We’re being offered a false choice.
1720	Pete Buttigieg	I don’t agree with the Vice President that Trump is an aberration.
1721	Pete Buttigieg	I don’t agree that there’s any such thing as back to normal because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didn’t work.
1722	Pete Buttigieg	That’s part of how we got here.
1723	Pete Buttigieg	That’s part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place.
1724	Pete Buttigieg	But I also don’t agree with Senator Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat.
1725	Pete Buttigieg	Yes we have to fight.
1726	Pete Buttigieg	Absolutely we have to fight for the big changes at hand, but it’s going to take more than fighting.
1727	Pete Buttigieg	Once again I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president.
1728	Pete Buttigieg	Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we’ve attempted in my lifetime.
1729	Pete Buttigieg	Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the ’80s, an assault weapons ban which would be a huge deal, making college free for low and middle income students.
1730	Pete Buttigieg	Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesn’t count unless we go even further.
1731	Pete Buttigieg	Free college for low and middle income students isn’t good enough unless we’re also paying for the children of billionaires.
1732	Pete Buttigieg	Immigration reform isn’t enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings.
1733	Pete Buttigieg	We have an opportunity to do the biggest things-
1734	Anderson Cooper	Thank you Mayor.
1735	Pete Buttigieg	… we’ve done in my lifetime.
1736	Anderson Cooper	Senator-
1737	Joe Biden	[crosstalk 02:35:43] I did not say back to normal.
1738	Anderson Cooper	Thank you Mayor.
1739	Senator Warren	[crosstalk 02:35:45] … he called me out by name.
1740	Anderson Cooper	Senator Klobuchar.
1741	Amy Klobuchar	Thank you.
1742	Anderson Cooper	Senator Klobuchar.
1743	Amy Klobuchar	This isn’t a fly over part of the country to me.
1744	Amy Klobuchar	The heartland is where I live.
1745	Amy Klobuchar	I want to win those states that we lost last time.
1746	Amy Klobuchar	I have bold ideas to get us there.
1747	Amy Klobuchar	I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold.
1748	Amy Klobuchar	But we can’t get any of this done, on climate change or immigration reform, unless they win.
1749	Amy Klobuchar	What I have done is win.
1750	Amy Klobuchar	The only one up here time and time again the reddest of red districts.
1751	Amy Klobuchar	Michele Bachmann’s, I won that district three times.
1752	Amy Klobuchar	Rural districts that border Iowa and North, and South, Dakota.
1753	Amy Klobuchar	I do it by going not just where it’s comfortable but where it’s uncomfortable.
1754	Amy Klobuchar	That is why I have been in Pennsylvania, and in Michigan, and in Wisconsin, and all over Ohio, and in Iowa.
1755	Amy Klobuchar	Because I think we need to build a blue Democratic wall around those states and-
1756	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
1757	Amy Klobuchar	… make Donald Trump pay for it.
1758	Anderson Cooper	Senator Warren she referenced you so you can respond.
1759	Senator Warren	People who are struggling to pay healthcare are fighting today.
1760	Senator Warren	People who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today.
1761	Senator Warren	People who are getting stopped by the police, or paid less because of the color of their skin, are in a fight today.
1762	Senator Warren	Anyone who doesn’t understand that Americans are already in these fights is not someone who’s likely to win them.
1763	Senator Warren	For me this is about knowing what’s broken, knowing how to fix it.
1764	Senator Warren	Yes I’m willing to get out there and fight for it.
1765	Anderson Cooper	Senator Sanders-
1766	Pete Buttigieg	But there’s a missing piece-
1767	Anderson Cooper	[crosstalk 02:37:20] Senator Sanders why is your approach more likely to beat President Trump?
1768	Bernie Sanders	I’ll tell you why.
1769	Anderson Cooper	Please-
1770	Bernie Sanders	[crosstalk 02:37:26] Here’s the radical reason why, it’s what the American people want.
1771	Senator Warren	Yes.
1772	Bernie Sanders	All right?
1773	Bernie Sanders	The American people do not want tax breaks for billionaires.
1774	Bernie Sanders	They want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes.
1775	Bernie Sanders	Poll came out yesterday, 71% of Democrats support Medicare for all.
1776	Bernie Sanders	The people of this country understand that we got to make public colleges and universities tuition free.
1777	Bernie Sanders	More and more Americans, including Republicans, understand we need bold action if we’re going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren.
1778	Bernie Sanders	The way you win an election, in this time in history, is not the same old same old.
1779	Bernie Sanders	You have to inspire people, you have to excite people.
1780	Bernie Sanders	You got to bring working people, and young people, and poor people into-
1781	Anderson Cooper	Senator thank you.
1782	Bernie Sanders	… the political process.
1783	Anderson Cooper	Congressman-
1784	Bernie Sanders	Because they know you stand for them not corporate America.
1785	Anderson Cooper	Congressman O’Rourke is political revolution what the American people want?
1786	Anderson Cooper	Your response?
1787	Beto O’Rourke	There was some talk about getting big things done.
1788	Beto O’Rourke	When I was first elected to Congress I found that El Paso, Texas had the worst wait times in the country to see a mental healthcare provider at the VA.
1789	Beto O’Rourke	I don’t know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country, or even most people in El Paso, but it was important to those veterans who I served.
1790	Beto O’Rourke	We set about turning around the VA.
1791	Beto O’Rourke	Hiring up the psychiatrists, and psychologists, and therapists to take care of those women and men who’d put their lives on the line for this country.
1792	Beto O’Rourke	We were able to do that.
1793	Beto O’Rourke	We took what we learned and we applied it to a national law.
1794	Beto O’Rourke	As a member of the minority, working with Republicans and Democrats alike, to expand mental healthcare access for veterans nationally.
1795	Beto O’Rourke	Then in Texas, one of what was thought to be the reddest states in the country, going to every single county-
1796	Anderson Cooper	Thank you Congressman.
1797	Beto O’Rourke	… talking about this progressive agenda and winning more votes than any Democrat has ever won.
1798	Beto O’Rourke	That’s the way that we defeat Donald Trump in-
1799	Anderson Cooper	Congressman O’Rourke thank you-
1800	Beto O’Rourke	… November of 2020.
1801	Anderson Cooper	We have to take a quick break.
1802	Anderson Cooper	The CNN/New York Times Debate, live from Ohio, will continue right after this.
1803	Anderson Cooper	(music)
1804	Anderson Cooper	We’re back for the CNN/ New York Times Democratic Presidential Debate.
1805	Anderson Cooper	We have time for one more question that we would like all of you to weigh in on.
1806	Anderson Cooper	Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former president George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game.
1807	Anderson Cooper	Ellen defended their friendship saying, “We’re all different, and I think that we’ve forgotten that.
1808	Anderson Cooper	That’s okay, that we’re all different.” So in that spirit, we’d like you to tell us about a friendship that you’ve had that would surprise us, what impacts it’s had on you and your beliefs.
1809	Anderson Cooper	Secretary Castro begin with you.
1810	Julian Castro	Well, first of all, thank you to Mark, thank you Anderson, and thank you Aaron and CNN and New York Times and everybody who’s here tonight.
1811	Julian Castro	Some of the most interesting friendships that I’ve had have been with people different from me.
1812	Julian Castro	Either people older than me that had a lot to teach me or people who grew up very different from me.
1813	Julian Castro	Also, teachers as I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine.
1814	Julian Castro	And sometimes also, and this goes to the heart of your question, I think people who thought differently from me.
1815	Julian Castro	Folks that I considered and have considered friends, and I think that there’s a value to that.
1816	Julian Castro	I think that that should be reflected more in our public life.
1817	Julian Castro	I also believe to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others.
1818	Julian Castro	I believe that we should be more kind to other folks.
1819	Julian Castro	I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they’ve done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something, and I think that we can do both of those things.
1820	Julian Castro	I think that we can kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions and their people, whether it’s our former president, George W. Bush or others that should be held accountable just as we should be kind.
1821	Julian Castro	We shouldn’t be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what they’ve done.
1822	Anderson Cooper	Congresswoman Gabbard.
1823	Tulsi Gabbard	Thank.
1824	Tulsi Gabbard	You know where I come from in Hawaii.
1825	Tulsi Gabbard	Many of you know, we greet each other with Aloha.
1826	Tulsi Gabbard	It’s not a word that means hello and goodbye.
1827	Tulsi Gabbard	It actually means something much more powerful than that.
1828	Tulsi Gabbard	It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we are all connected.
1829	Tulsi Gabbard	We are all brothers and sisters, we are all God’s children.
1830	Tulsi Gabbard	So I’ve developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially with Republicans like Trey Gowdy, for example.
1831	Tulsi Gabbard	He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues.
1832	Tulsi Gabbard	We’ve developed a friendship that’s based on respect and he’s been there for me during some personally challenging times.
1833	Tulsi Gabbard	The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided.
1834	Tulsi Gabbard	Donald Trump must be defeated.
1835	Tulsi Gabbard	But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump.
1836	Tulsi Gabbard	We need to deliver a win for the American people.
1837	Tulsi Gabbard	We must stand United as Americans remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected.
1838	Tulsi Gabbard	This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president.
1839	Tulsi Gabbard	Inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all.
1840	Tulsi Gabbard	When I look out at our country, I don’t see deplorables, I see fellow Americans.
1841	Tulsi Gabbard	People who I treat with respect even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly.
1842	Tulsi Gabbard	I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender or political affiliation.
1843	Tulsi Gabbard	So I want to ask everyone to join me.
1844	Tulsi Gabbard	Join me in bringing about this government of by and for the people that serves all the people of this country and visit my website, tulsi2020.com for more information.
1845	Anderson Cooper	Thank you Congresswoman.
1846	Anderson Cooper	Senator Klobuchar.
1847	Amy Klobuchar	For me, it’s John McCain and I miss him every day.
1848	Amy Klobuchar	I traveled all over the world with him and he would sometimes when we were seated with world leaders and they would look away from me, he’d say, “Senator Klobuchar is a lead Democrat on this trip and she will go next.” And I still remember being there at his ranch.
1849	Amy Klobuchar	John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying and he pointed to some words in his book because he could hardly talk.
1850	Amy Klobuchar	And the word said this, there is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.
1851	Amy Klobuchar	That’s what we’re doing right now.
1852	Amy Klobuchar	And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us.
1853	Amy Klobuchar	And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics, to look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other because the way we win and not just win the presidency, but take back the US Senate is by winning big.
1854	Amy Klobuchar	And the way we win big is with that fired up Democratic base that’s out there today, but it is also about bringing in independence and moderate Republicans.
1855	Amy Klobuchar	I can lead this and I asked you to join me because I’ve done it before and I will do it again, amyklobuchar.com.
1856	Amy Klobuchar	Join our team.
1857	Amy Klobuchar	Thank you.
1858	Anderson Cooper	Senator, thank you very much.
1859	Anderson Cooper	Mr. Steyer, tell us about your most surprising friendship.
1860	Tom Steyer	I’m friends with a woman from Denmark, South Carolina, MD, Ana Berry who’s fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community.
1861	Tom Steyer	She’s a different gender, she’s a different race, she’s from a different part of the country.
1862	Tom Steyer	But she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism.
1863	Tom Steyer	And her honor, my mother was a school teacher in the New York public schools and in the Brooklyn House of Detention.
1864	Tom Steyer	My father was the first generation in his family to go to college.
1865	Tom Steyer	My grandfather was a plumber.
1866	Tom Steyer	He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg.
1867	Tom Steyer	And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, “When you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day and every single day after.” And that’s why I started the need to impeach movement two years ago, because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
1868	Tom Steyer	And over 10 years ago, I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis, and I’ve been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully and that’s why I’m running for president because our government has failed.
1869	Tom Steyer	It’s been taught by corporations and it’s absolutely essential to return power to the people.
1870	Tom Steyer	I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do, which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every single day.
1871	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
1872	Anderson Cooper	Congressman O’Rourke.
1873	Beto O’Rourke	I’ve always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges regardless of the differences.
1874	Beto O’Rourke	I did that as a small business owner more than 20 years ago, making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas.
1875	Beto O’Rourke	Did it as a member of the city council where I saw my colleagues, not as Republicans or Democrats, but my fellow EL Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community.
1876	Beto O’Rourke	As a member of Congress, I remember being in San Antonio, I was visiting the VA there March of 2017.
1877	Beto O’Rourke	I found that my flight had been snowed in Washington, D.C.
1878	Beto O’Rourke	Happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd and on a whim I said, “Do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington?” And he called my bluff.
1879	Beto O’Rourke	We got in that Chevy Impala last car on the lot, it was spring break, drove 1600 miles across the country.
1880	Beto O’Rourke	Live streamed the conversation, a Republican and a Democrat, finding out what we had in common.
1881	Beto O’Rourke	By the end of that trip, not only had we formed a friendship, but we had formed trust.
1882	Beto O’Rourke	We worked with each other on each other’s bills.
1883	Beto O’Rourke	I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill, showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats can work together on an otherwise contentious issue.
1884	Beto O’Rourke	And then across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes than in any Democrat.
1885	Beto O’Rourke	We want independence and Republicans in record numbers as well.
1886	Beto O’Rourke	I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that America rises to this opportunity.
1887	Anderson Cooper	Senator Booker, tell us about your most surprising friendships.
1888	Senator Booker	Well, look, I have so many, I don’t even know where to count.
1889	Senator Booker	I was the mayor of a large city with a Republican governor, he and I had to form a friendship even though I can write a dissertation on our disagreements.
1890	Senator Booker	When I got to the United States Senate, I went there with a purpose of making friendships across the aisle.
1891	Senator Booker	I go to Bible study and chairman in Hoff’s office.
1892	Senator Booker	He and I passed legislation together to help homeless and foster kids.
1893	Senator Booker	I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner and let me again say, finding a dinner in a restaurant, agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing.
1894	Senator Booker	I’m a vegan and he’s a meat eating Texan, but I’ll tell you this right now, this is the moment in America that this is our test, the spirit of our country, I believe in the values of rugged individualism and self-reliance, but think about our history.
1895	Senator Booker	Rugged individualism didn’t get us to the moon.
1896	Senator Booker	It didn’t beat the Nazis.
1897	Senator Booker	It didn’t map the human genome.
1898	Senator Booker	It didn’t beat Jim Crow.
1899	Senator Booker	Everything we did in this country, big and vice president, we have done so many big things.
1900	Senator Booker	The fact that there’s an openly gay man now, black woman, all of us on the stage or because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose.
1901	Senator Booker	This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office, it’s a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other.
1902	Senator Booker	The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic grace in our country.
1903	Senator Booker	Teach us a more courageous empathy and remind America that patriotism is love of country and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow country men and women and love is not sentimentality, it’s not anemic.
1904	Senator Booker	Love is struggle.
1905	Senator Booker	Love is sacrifice.
1906	Senator Booker	Love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the declaration of independence that if we’re ever going to make it as a nation, we must mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.
1907	Senator Booker	I am running for president to restore that sacred honor and if you believe in not like I do, please join me by going to corybooker.com.
1908	Senator Booker	Thank you.
1909	Anderson Cooper	Thank you Senator.
1910	Anderson Cooper	Mr. Yang.
1911	Andrew Yang	First I want to thank all the voters tuned in at home.
1912	Andrew Yang	If you don’t feel like you got your question answered tonight, it’s understandable, there are 12 of us.
1913	Andrew Yang	I’m going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours Friday.
1914	Andrew Yang	My website, yang2020.com and if you ask your question tonight, there’s a better chance I’ll get to it.
1915	Andrew Yang	My surprising friendship, it’s been so much fun running for president because I’ve gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise.
1916	Andrew Yang	The friendship that sticks out for me guy named Fred, who’s an avid Trump supporter, a trucker.
1917	Andrew Yang	He let me ride in his truck for hours.
1918	Andrew Yang	He spent some time in jail.
1919	Andrew Yang	I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs.
1920	Andrew Yang	And I’m happy to say that after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me.
1921	Andrew Yang	And we’ve remained in touch ever since.
1922	Andrew Yang	The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party.
1923	Andrew Yang	The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists, and radiologists.
1924	Andrew Yang	It does not care about our party.
1925	Andrew Yang	Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016 and what did he say?
1926	Andrew Yang	He said, we’re going to build a wall.
1927	Andrew Yang	We’re going to turn the clock back.
1928	Andrew Yang	We’re going to bring the old jobs back.
1929	Andrew Yang	America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things.
1930	Andrew Yang	We have to turn the clock forward.
1931	Andrew Yang	We have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible.
1932	Andrew Yang	We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value.
1933	Andrew Yang	It is not left, it is not right, it is forward and that is where we must take the country in 2020.
1934	Anderson Cooper	Mr. Yang, thank you very much.
1935	Anderson Cooper	Senator Harris.
1936	Kamala Harris	Thank you.
1937	Kamala Harris	Probably Paul Ryan.
1938	Kamala Harris	Actually, I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States.
1939	Kamala Harris	He and I agree on almost nothing, but we agreed on that.
1940	Kamala Harris	And after we joined forces, he said to me, “Kamila, you know, Appalachia loves this.
1941	Kamala Harris	And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
1942	Kamala Harris	And I guess that’s why I’m running.
1943	Kamala Harris	I do believe that to beat Donald Trump, but also to heal our country.
1944	Kamala Harris	We need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
1945	Kamala Harris	And I’ll tell you, my mother was 19 when she left India alone and she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer.
1946	Kamala Harris	And so she arrived in California, she was supposed to have an arranged marriage, but she got involved in the civil rights movement.
1947	Kamala Harris	She met my father and that produced my sister and me.
1948	Kamala Harris	They got married.
1949	Kamala Harris	But when I was five, that marriage ended.
1950	Kamala Harris	But my mother convinced us that we could do anything.
1951	Kamala Harris	And so I became the first woman attorney, general California.
1952	Kamala Harris	The second black woman elected to the United States Senate.
1953	Kamala Harris	And I will tell you, that’s part of why I’m running, because Donald Trump, if he had his way, my story would not be possible.
1954	Kamala Harris	And I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideals will always hold true.
1955	Kamala Harris	And so that’s what is at stake in this election and I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it.
1956	Anderson Cooper	Thank you.
1957	Anderson Cooper	Senator Harris.
1958	Anderson Cooper	Mayor Buttigieg.
1959	Pete Buttigieg	Well, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military.
1960	Pete Buttigieg	People who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics and we learned to trust each other with our lives.
1961	Pete Buttigieg	When they got into my vehicle, and when we went outside the wire, they didn’t care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend.
1962	Pete Buttigieg	They didn’t care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not.
1963	Pete Buttigieg	We just learned to trust each other.
1964	Pete Buttigieg	In fact, the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important.
1965	Pete Buttigieg	I guess I’ll follow in the pattern tonight and point out you could go to peteforamerica.com and read all about it.
1966	Pete Buttigieg	It’s also about building a sense of belonging in this country because I think that’s what friendship and that’s what service can create and I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating and we’re seeing a rise in the deaths from despair.
1967	Pete Buttigieg	I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country.
1968	Pete Buttigieg	The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president.
1969	Pete Buttigieg	It is the unification of the American people and I’m asking for your vote to be that president when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future.
1970	Anderson Cooper	Mr. Mayor, thank you.
1971	Anderson Cooper	Senator Sanders.
1972	Bernie Sanders	When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on veterans affairs, I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation in modern American history and I failed.
1973	Bernie Sanders	I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate, so we had to go back to the drawing board.
1974	Bernie Sanders	And I worked with John McCain and I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted, but it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the veterans administration.
1975	Bernie Sanders	More recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, mike Lee.
1976	Bernie Sanders	And Mike understood, although he and I disagree on everything, that the US involvement in the Saudi led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen.
1977	Bernie Sanders	And for the first time in 45 years, we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get the votes to get the US troops out of that area.
1978	Bernie Sanders	But I think at the end of the day what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion, and there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1%.
1979	Bernie Sanders	A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.
1980	Anderson Cooper	Senator Sanders, thank you.
1981	Anderson Cooper	Senator Warren.
1982	Senator Warren	You asked about a surprising friend.
1983	Senator Warren	For me, it would be Charles Fried.
1984	Senator Warren	27 years ago when I was under consideration for a job, he was someone who had been George Bush, the first solicitor general, a deeply principled Republican.
1985	Senator Warren	And we didn’t agree on much.
1986	Senator Warren	I was far more liberal than he was, but he also was willing to listen to my work about what’s happening to America’s middle class.
1987	Senator Warren	And Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job.
1988	Senator Warren	I grew up out in Oklahoma, I have three older brothers.
1989	Senator Warren	They all served in the military.
1990	Senator Warren	Two of the three are still Republicans.
1991	Senator Warren	I love all three of my brothers and there are a lot of things that we’re divided on there are core things that we believe in together.
1992	Senator Warren	We want to see all of our children get a good start in life.
1993	Senator Warren	We don’t want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by healthcare.
1994	Senator Warren	We’re willing to get out there for the things we believe in.
1995	Senator Warren	Look, people across this country, whether they’re Democrats, independents, or Republicans, they know what’s broken.
1996	Senator Warren	They know that we have an America that’s working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind.
1997	Senator Warren	People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say no more.
1998	Senator Warren	We want an America that works for everyone.
1999	Senator Warren	2020 is our moment in history.
2000	Senator Warren	It is a deep honor to be here, to be in this fight.
2001	Senator Warren	I know what’s broken, I know how to fix it and we are building a grassroots movement to get it done.
2002	Senator Warren	That includes everyone.
2003	Anderson Cooper	Thank you, Senator Warren.
2004	Anderson Cooper	Vice president Biden.
2005	Joe Biden	This is reassuring in the fact that we’re all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done.
2006	Joe Biden	No other way to get anything done in this country.
2007	Joe Biden	The two people maybe that surprised you the most were, he’s been mentioned twice, but John McCain.
2008	Joe Biden	John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy and he was assigned to me to travel around the world.
2009	Joe Biden	We became close friends, became very close friends with my wife, Jill.
2010	Joe Biden	Visited our home.
2011	Joe Biden	He was there with his children and on his deathbed, he asked me to do his eulogy.
2012	Joe Biden	I would say to John, “John, you didn’t see a war.
2013	Joe Biden	You never wanted a fight.” And he’d say, “You didn’t see a problem.
2014	Joe Biden	You’d never wanted to solve.” But he was a great man of principle.
2015	Joe Biden	He was honorable, he was honorable.
2016	Joe Biden	And one of the things, that’s the reason why I’m running, we have to restore the soul of this country.
2017	Joe Biden	That’s why I’m doing this.
2018	Joe Biden	In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous, a liar.
2019	Joe Biden	He cheats.
2020	Joe Biden	He does not do anything to promote people generally.
2021	Joe Biden	Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class and the only we’re going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle.
2022	Joe Biden	My dad used to say, “A job’s about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey.
2023	Joe Biden	It’s about your dignity.” We have to restore people’s dignity.
2024	Joe Biden	And lastly, we have to unite the country because folks, it’s time we stop walking around with our heads down.
2025	Joe Biden	We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century.
2026	Joe Biden	So for God’s sake, get up, get up, and remember, this is the United States of America.
2027	Joe Biden	There’s nothing, nothing we’re unable to do when we decide we’re going to do it.
2028	Joe Biden	Nothing at all, period.
2029	Anderson Cooper	Candidates, thank you.
2030	Anderson Cooper	That concludes the fourth Democratic Presidential Debate.
2031	Anderson Cooper	We want to thank Otterbein University for hosting us.
2032	Anderson Cooper	Now, please stay tuned for CNN for special coverage of tonight’s debate with Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo.
2033	Jake Tapper	Hello everyone.
2034	Jake Tapper	I’m Jake Tapper at the Democratic Debate here in Westerville, Ohio tonight…
