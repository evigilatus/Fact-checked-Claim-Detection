Scott Walker\u2019s cuts to public education.\n\"Now Republican legislators must answer to the people of Wisconsin: Where is the money they promised and why are our public schools last in line?\" asked state Rep. Katrina Shankland, D-Stevens Point, who is assistant Democratic leader.\n\"Republicans have already cut our neighborhood public schools three budgets in a row,\" Shankland said in a news release on May 6, 2015. \"They\u2019ve perpetrated the largest cut to public education in our state\u2019s history while funneling millions of public dollars into unaccountable private schools.\"\nThat\u2019s a lot to chew on.\nIn 2012 we rated True a claim by Democrat Kathleen Falk that in his first two-year budget, Scott Walker enacted \"the biggest cuts to education in our state\u2019s history.\"\nThat claim covered both kindergarten-12th grade schools and the public university system. But experts said Walker\u2019s K-12 cuts were the biggest ever.\nNow we\u2019ll rate Shankland\u2019s claim that \"Republicans have already cut our neighborhood public schools three budgets in a row.\"\nIt\u2019s clear she meant Walker\u2019s first two budgets, plus the proposed 2015-\u201917 budget that legislators are still working on: Republicans have controlled the Legislature and governor\u2019s office since Walker\u2019s election in 2010.\nAsked to back up the claim, Shankland aide Annika Petty explained that according to the office\u2019s calculations, Walker and fellow Republicans have cut general state aid to local schools by $1.4 billion under the 2011-\u201913 and 2013-\u201915 enacted budgets plus the governor\u2019s proposed 2015-\u201917 plan.\nShe gets that number by comparing the funding level before Walker\u2019s arrival to that in each of the six years since, and adding up the difference.\nThe funding, in each of those six years, is lower than the amount from the last pre-Walker budget year, 2010-'11.\nSo in that sense, Republicans have come up short of the Doyle mark in each of the last three budgets (though the outcome of the current budget is pending).\nBut there\u2019s another much more common way to view this: Looking at how each budget compares to the final year of the previous budget.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s typically the framework legislators use during budget deliberations. Each new budget uses the expiring budget as a starting point.\nWalker\u2019s first enacted budget cut general aids by 8 percent compared to the pre-Walker base year.\nBut the second budget enacted under Walker actually added back some of the cuts. Funding went up 2 percent over the first Republican budget.\nIn the third, pending budget, there\u2019s a 2.6 percent increase over the previous budget.\nSo by the typical way of looking at budgets in Madison, Republicans have cut once and added back twice.\n(Two notes: Doyle cut general school funding in his last budget, breaking with decades of increases. And general-aid trends vary by school district. In the last four years, between 56 percent and 97 percent of school districts saw aid reductions from 2011 to 2013. In 2014, that trend flipped; a bare majority saw increases).\nBudget watchers with the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research organization, said Shankland\u2019s method overstate the cuts because of the way it takes a base year and compares it to six subsequent years.\nTodd Berry, president of the group, also noted that some of Walker\u2019s Act 10 law resulted in significant savings for many school districts, helping to offset some or all of the cuts.\nBut Berry said the aid money Republicans added back might not have mattered in many cases because the state placed tight limits on what school districts could raise in total from property taxes and state aid.\nFinally, we note that Shankland focused on general state aid, but school officials say that Walker\u2019s pending budget would cut a more crucial form of special-purpose aid (categorical aids, in Madison parlance) over the two years from 2015-'17.\nOur rating\nShankland claimed that \"Republicans have already cut our neighborhood public schools three budgets in a row.\"\nThere\u2019s an element of truth in her claim in that general school aid is lower in Walker\u2019s proposed third budget than it was before he took office.\nBut it\u2019s misleading to say three budgets \"in a row\" made cuts, when two of them actually restored some of the general aid lost in Walker\u2019s first budget.\nWe rate Shankland\u2019s claim Mostly \u00a0False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06429"}
