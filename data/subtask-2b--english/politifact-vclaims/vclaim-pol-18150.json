Eddie Glaude Jr., an African American studies professor at Princeton University, said that Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States could be comparable to former President George W. Bush\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina.\u00a0\n\"I was thinking in terms of politics,\" Glaude said. \"We talked about the business community finally not kind of sticking with Donald Trump. But this may be, and Nicolle, I should mention this with trepidation, but this may be Donald Trump\u2019s Katrina.\"\n\"Let\u2019s just lean into that for a minute,\" replied Wallace, who served as Bush\u2019s communications director. \"Katrina was the moment when all the things that felt incredibly incompetent about the Bush presidency, the appointment of Harriet Myers to the Supreme Court, the botched attempt to pass Social Security privatization \u2014 I mean I lived it, I can go through the whole list \u2014 were realized. We gave them a proof point that we were indeed incompetent. Also people died. This has the makings structurally for the same kind of moment for President Trump.\"\n\"And if there\u2019s any \u2018a moment\u2019 that would shake that 40%,\" Glaude said, \"the folks who would allow him to shoot someone right down Fifth Avenue, if there\u2019s any \u2018a moment,\u2019 it\u2019s this one. Because it\u2019s babies, it\u2019s friends, it\u2019s loved ones \u2026 it seems to me that this is an event that could take down a presidency.\"\nBut neither Wallace nor Glaude said that they \"hope enough people die from coronavirus that it harms Trump\u2019s re-election.\"\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18150"}
