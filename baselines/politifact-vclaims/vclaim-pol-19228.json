It was in honor of his dead son.\" The post features a photo of Beau wearing a similar watch.\nBut the watch didn\u2019t belong to Beau. It was gifted to Biden by first lady Jill Biden.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from the White House, but the administration told news website Mediaite that the Rolex was a Christmas gift from the first lady. It\u2019s unclear if Beau\u2019s ownership of a similar watch was a factor in its selection.\u00a0\nThe New York Times article, which ran in the fashion section of the paper, mentions that recent presidents opted to wear cheaper, \"everyman\" timepieces to avoid looking flashy. (President Donald Trump commonly wore a yellow gold Rolex, along with other expensive watches.)\u00a0\nBut it also acknowledged that Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson proudly donned the luxury brand in office.\nIn a story about Biden\u2019s choice of time telling, GQ Magazine reported that Rolex makes a watch nicknamed \"The President,\" which is officially called the Day-Date. But Biden wore the more modest Datejust model, the same as Eisenhower in 1953.\u00a0\n\"In 1951, when Dwight Eisenhower was still just a five-star general and not yet the president of the United States, Rolex reached out with an offer. The company wanted to outfit the general with a Datejust and sent him a gold version engraved with his initials,\" GQ reported. \"The watch famously appeared on a cover of Life with the general and then accompanied him into the White House in 1953.\"\nBiden\u2019s watch was a Christmas gift from his wife.
