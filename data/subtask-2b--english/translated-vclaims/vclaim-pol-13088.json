Not so, Congressman Virginia J. Randy Forbes says, R-4th. With the expectation that the State will reach the debt ceiling of $14.294 trillion earlier today, a decision on the debt ceiling is on the horizon. Unlike previous votes, this would not be a formality. The Republicans say they will not agree to an increase in debt without a comprehensive plan to reduce it. Recognizing that consensus will not be reached by today, Forbes co-sponsored the \"Comprehensive Faith and Credit Act,\" which requires the United States Treasury to give priority to payments on public debt over any other payments when we reach the limit. In a post on his website, Forbes is moving his legislation as a safeguard, saying that warnings of an imminent financial disaster were extremely exaggerated. \"The most inflammatory speech we hear is the threat that failure to raise the debt line would automatically lead the United States to default on our national debt. This allegation is fortunately unfounded. &quot; Really? We decided to take a look. Although Forbes did not identify those believed guilty of publishing a \"fire speech,\" an increasing number of Republicans in the House of Representatives accuse United States Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Guithner of overestimating the risk of default if the debt line is not raised by this summer. In his blog, Forbes published the same argument as that used by critics of Gethner. \"Whether the debt ceiling is raised or not, the federal government collects much more revenue than it needs to meet American debt obligations,\" Forbes wrote. \"If the debt ceiling is reached, the government will still have 10 times the revenue that needs to be paid. The only way in which the United States will immediately default upon reaching the debt ceiling is if the Government chooses to do so effectively by defaulting on debt payments.\" Well, if we're talking about today, Forbes is absolutely right. As it became clear that no consensus would be reached by today, the United States Treasury said that through various financial exercises, it could extend until 2 August the deadline before defaulting is even possible. Okay, but the bigger question is, if Congress is still blocked in early August, are we unable to \"spontaneously\" then? Okay, no. But it won't be beautiful. \"What will happen is that we must stop paying for our elderly - our medical care, medical assistance, social security,\" said Jethner recently in an interview with ABC. \"We must stop paying veterans' dues. We have to stop paying all the other payments for all the other things that the government does. \"And then we risk defaulting on interest\" added. A report of the Congressional Research Service supported this evaluation by Guithner. The Federal Government needed to borrow $738 billion beyond the current legal limit for funding liabilities for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ended on 30 September. \"To put this in context,\" the report said, \"The Federal Government must cancel all spending on assessed programmes, reduce approximately 70 per cent of expenditures for mandatory programmes, increase revenue collection by about two thirds, or take a combination of these actions in the second half of fiscal year 2011 in order to avoid an increase in the debt line. Further reductions in expenditure and/or increases in income will be required, under the current policy, in fiscal year 2012 and beyond to avoid an increase in the debt ceiling.\" Jim Horny, an analyst at a left-wing centre on budget and policy priorities, said that taking tough steps to keep pace with debt payments would not avoid credit problems in the United States. The federal Government was likely to still fall short of paying for goods, services and benefits to social security and medical beneficiaries. He said, \"There are really serious consequences for our failure to fulfil any of our legal obligations even if we pay interest but fail to pay for other things.\" \"It will seriously damage the credibility and credibility of the United States\" Government.\" Horny said that a reversal of any payments would lead creditors to lose confidence in the United States to meet all their obligations and lead to higher interest rates. On the other hand, some conservatives argue that this would simply force the United States to start living within its means. \"It would be a disaster if we failed to pay our debts. It would be a disaster if we hit an asteroid. I think hitting an asteroid is a more likely scenario, \"He said J.D. Foster, financial policy expert with the Conservative Heritage Foundation. It is suggested that Congress look for substantial spending cuts or provide guidance through legislation for which debt should first be paid to reassure creditors. Let's look back. Forbes argued that failure to raise the debt ceiling would not automatically result in the United States defaulting on its debt. We examined it against two deadlines: first, 16 May, at which we are expected to reach the current debt ceiling, and then the fateful date announced by the Treasury in August. On both of them, Forbes is right. The Treasury has already said we can reach the limit and we'll be fine for a few months. After 2 August, debt payments could continue at the expense of distortion of popular government programmes. This is an option. It is therefore estimated that Forbes' claim is correct.
