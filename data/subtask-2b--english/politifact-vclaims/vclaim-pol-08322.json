The only thing you could see on the field were the lines that they would clear out.\"\n1) That sounds like a lot of snow.\n2) We\u2019re not expecting anything close in East Rutherford, N.J., for the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos.\n3) The story Martin told is pretty exaggerated.\nThe Steelers did play Martin\u2019s Jets in the snow in East Rutherford on Dec. 14, 2003.\nMartin had a statistically great game, rushing for 174 yards while adding 54 yards receiving.The Jets won 6-0 on two Doug Brien field goals.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe size of the snow pile, however, apparently has grown in Martin\u2019s mind since the game was played a decade ago.\nMost media reports say the teams played in several inches of snow before the snow became freezing rain in the second half. Weather history from Weather Underground, which relies on airport weather data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, says that about 4 inches of snow fell in the East Rutherford area on Dec. 14, not 23 inches.\nThe New York Daily News also reported 4 inches of snow that day, saying: \"four inches of snow, then sleet turning to rain and 30-mph wind gusts.\"\nAnd here\u2019s how Jets kicker Brien described a second-quarter field goal at the time to New York\u2019s Journal News: \"There was 4 inches of snow on the ground. I was fortunate that we had a timeout and the line was able to clear away a pretty good space for me, and that was big.\"\nLastly, while the NFL is very good about making sure videos of their games do not appear on the Internet, there is photographic evidence that there was not 23 or even 15 inches of snow that day.\nWe have a photo of Brien\u2019s 41-yard field goal, and we have an image of Martin in what appears to be a few inches.\nOur ruling\nFormer Jets star running back Curtis Martin said he once played a game in 15 inches of snow.\nThis is one of those stories that gets more unbelievable as the years pass. That\u2019s because it\u2019s not true. We rate Martin\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08322"}
