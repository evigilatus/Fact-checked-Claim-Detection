Scott Walker in November 2014.\nShe\u2019s labeled Walker a big spender.\nAsked by a Madison Capital Times reporter if she supported the $650 million income tax cut signed by Walker in 2013, the former state Commerce secretary said she would have wanted to see whether it put the state budget in a strong position going forward.\nBut she suggested strongly that it didn\u2019t.\n\"You've seen where we're now going from a $700 million surplus to getting into the next biennium with almost a $750 million deficit,\" Burke said in the interview published Nov. 6, 2013. \"I'd love to be able to do tax cuts, but they have to be done in a way that is benefiting the state and is setting us up for fiscal responsibility in the long term.\"\nWalker frequently touts his frugal budgeting ways and emphasis on tax cuts.\nDid he really turn a state surplus red?\nYes and no.\nWe\u2019ve tested one of Burke\u2019s numbers before: Walker\u2019s first budget (covering July 2011- June 2013) ended with a cash balance of $759 million, according to an accounting prepared in October 2013 by the nonpartisan budget scorekeeping agency, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\nThe bureau is considered the gold standard for independent budget scorekeeping. It is also what Burke cited when we asked her for backup.\nMany readers may not be familiar with the second number she cites, the $750 million \"deficit.\"\nThe Fiscal Bureau came up with that figure, too, so Burke mentions two credible figures.\nBut the negative number she mentions is not a concrete figure that compares easily to the hard-cash surplus Burke cites.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a rough projection of the amount of tax-collection growth the Legislature and governor will need in mid-2015 to balance the next two-year budget, covering 2015-\u201917.\nLegislators use it as an exercise and a benchmarking tool.\nDuring budget deliberations, they\u2019ll call Bob Lang, Fiscal Bureau director, and ask how a tax cut -- or a spending increase for a certain program -- would affect the potential size of this budget gap down the road. The estimate is officially known as the \"structural deficit,\" which Burke shorthands as \"deficit.\"\nIt\u2019s rough because Lang doesn\u2019t try to guess how much tax collections might rise or fall, or factor in demand for Medicaid health programs, for example.\nBut, in part due to the tax cuts Burke discussed, it\u2019s true that the structural deficit heading into Walker\u2019s third budget is now estimated at that $725 million figure Burke mentioned.\nSo there\u2019s truth in her overall point.\nBut we won\u2019t have a hard number to compare to the 2013 Walker surplus until 2015.\nFor the record, Walker\u2019s two budgets have recorded the lowest \"structural deficits\" since Lang started keeping track in 1997.\nIt\u2019s not even close; they ranged from $1.5 billion to $2.9 billion before Walker. His first budget actually wiped out the structural deficit entirely heading into his second budget.\nWe\u2019ve dealt with similar mismatched numbers on the Truth-O-Meter before.\nWe rated Half True a Walker claim that,\"The $3.6 billion deficit we inherited has turned into more than a half-billion-dollar surplus.\"\nHis numbers also checked out individually, and his overall point on the big turnaround from red to black in his first budget is correct. But he mixed different ways to define the size of the turnaround, throwing the numbers off a bit.\nOur rating\nBurke said the state is going from a $700 million surplus \"to getting into the next biennium with almost a $750 million deficit.\"\nHer numbers check out, and she properly identifies a big swing in Walker\u2019s budgeting, but -- like Walker\u2019s similar claim -- there\u2019s a problem because the two numbers aren\u2019t easily compared.\nWe rate her claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08598"}
