Schools, social services and public safety have all taken cuts. In a recent newsletter, Our Oregon, a nonprofit backed by public employee unions, highlights those cuts and points to an alternative: Tax breaks.\n\nHere\u2019s what the newsletter says: \"The reason for this crisis is simple: As a state, we're not funding our schools at even an adequate level. And it's not that we don't have the resources, it's that we're choosing to give away the money through an ever-increasing list of tax breaks and loopholes.\n\nEven while state leaders have cut funding for our schools and other basic priorities, the amount of money the state is projected to give away through tax breaks increased by a whopping $3.4 billion.\"\n\nPolitiFact Oregon has looked a lot at budgets. We say this again and again, but technically the state budget as a whole is not shrinking. It\u2019s actually up about $400 million this biennium over last. But that growth isn\u2019t enough to keep up with inflation and other factors. That means, even with budget increases, the state still has to make service cuts.\n\nThe state\u2019s schools are seeing something similar happen. The State School Fund is up about $160 million this biennium over last and yet teachers are being laid off and class sizes are increasing.\n\nWe\u2019re also no stranger to the issue of tax breaks. Previously we looked into whether the state spends more on giveaways than it does on education, public safety and health care combined. The answer: Mostly True.\n\nStill, we wondered if lawmakers were really growing giveaways by the billions while cutting other programs.\n\nWe pulled out our copy of the state\u2019s 2011-13 Tax Expenditure Report and on Page 5 we found the numbers we needed. We figured Our Oregon was talking about this biennium compared to last -- by that measure, they were right. In the 2009-11 biennium, the state granted nearly $28 billion in tax breaks. This biennium, the total is expected to hit $31.4 billion. That\u2019s the $3.4 billion -- or 12 percent -- increase Our Oregon mentioned.\n\nWe confirmed with Our Oregon spokesman Scott Moore that those were the same numbers they looked at.\n\nFact checks, though, are never that easy. We wondered why this increase was happening, especially, as Our Oregon pointed out, during a time when other things are being cut.\n\nWe called the state\u2019s economist Mark McMullen and asked him if he could explain some of the growth to us. \"A lot of these are just going to grow organically or just along with the economy,\" he said. Some of these are particularly big breaks, too. Say mortgage interest deductions or state income tax deductions. A good chunk also comes from the fact that Oregon is linked to the federal tax code.\n\nThat is all to say that lawmakers can\u2019t cut these areas as easily as they can other spending. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t try. During the 2011 session, about 20 tax credits were set to expire and lawmakers opted to renew half of them -- or about $10 million worth. This is part of a recently instituted, six-year cycle in which all credits will get reviewed before being renewed.\n\nWe asked Moore whether he thought the group\u2019s newsletter might have pointed that out. \"The sunsetting of the tax breaks that they embarked on in the last session is a good start,\" he said. \"It's wonderful that they're doing that ... but right now that only applies to tax credits.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said, whether the growth happens with or without an explicit vote, the problem remains.\n\n\"We are automatically giving away money because we're connected to the federal tax code,\" he said. \"Rather than just throwing up their hands and just allowing us to be connected to the federal tax code (they should ask) \u2018Does this make sense for the state of Oregon?\u2019\"\n\nOur Oregon said in a newsletter that the state is projected to give away $3.4 billion more in tax breaks this biennium than the last, even as lawmakers make cuts in education and other programs. Education budgets have definitely seen service cuts -- though the actual state education budget has grown. Our Oregon\u2019s math is right, but we think it\u2019s important context that the increase isn\u2019t all a result of legislators passing new giveaways and that other budgets haven\u2019t shrunk so much as failed to keep up with growth.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10808"}
