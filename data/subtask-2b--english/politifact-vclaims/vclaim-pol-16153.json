Barack Obama, tweaked the Democratic candidate for his unwillingness to censure President Bush.\n\n\n\"He won't even support his colleague Sen. Russ Feingold's motion to censure the Bush administration for systemic repeated illegal wiretaps,\" Nader said in a June 18\n\ninterview on the radio program Democracy Now!\n\n\"He \u2014 you know, he's letting the corporate-dominated city of Washington, the corporations who actually rule us now in Washington, determine his agenda. And that does not augur well.\"\n\n\nFeingold of Wisconsin, known as one of the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, proposed a\n\nresolution to censure Bush\n\nin March 2006, three months after the\n\nNew York Times\n\n\nreported\n\nthat the president had secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants.\n\n\nCensure, a congressional action that is not defined in the Constitution, has evolved as a formal expression of strong condemnation that is short of impeachment. The Senate has censured only one U.S. president \u2014 Andrew Jackson, in 1834, for firing the secretary of the treasury in a dispute over deposits in a national bank. Jackson's party, the Democrats, later expunged the censure.\n\n\nFeingold's proposal was to \"condemn [Bush's] unlawful authorization of wiretaps of Americans within the United States without obtaining the court orders required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
