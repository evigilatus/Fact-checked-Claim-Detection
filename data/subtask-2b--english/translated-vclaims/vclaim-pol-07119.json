Tavis Smiley says so.", "text": "In an effort to reduce panic, some compared the current Ebola outbreak with previous epidemics - particularly the SARS outbreak in 2003. In the 19th week of October, the host of Tavis Smiley's talk show said that those who believe that President Barack Obama's response to the Ebola virus is disproportionately explosive. For the context, they must remember the outbreak of SARS - sudden acute respiratory syndrome - 10 years ago. I spoke to Mary Matalin, the Republican Strategic, and she said, \"This isn't as bad as Sars was in 2003, and everyone wants to pile up, Mary, like I did with all the things that Obama did wrong. I've been critical of certain cases, but this isn't the President's fault.\" Is Smiley right that Sars in 2003 was worse than the Ebola crisis today? Well, that depends on the context. We spoke to the experts and found that the Ebola and SARS outbreak at their original points - West Africa and Hong Kong, respectively - was more devastating. The severe acute respiratory syndrome, on the other hand, has a wider global scope than Ebola. Lori Garrett, a senior colleague of global health on the Council of External Relations, said. Several experts have told us that the potential for Ebola - and humanitarian losses in West Africa - increases concern. Note: In both cases, Ebola does not pose a significant threat to the United States, although it may harm other countries. At the outset, there are some WHO data comparing the outbreak of SARS in 2003 and the current Ebola outbreak on 17 October. \u2219 SARS - 2003 Ebola - 2014 25+7 affected countries 8,096 cases (global), 9,216 cases of health workers (global) 1 423,706 deaths (global), 4,774 deaths, 555 deaths By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, death rate 9.6 per cent 50 per cent (United States) 27, 3 cases contracted in the United States 0, 2 deaths (United States) 0, fixed treatment 0, no one There are already more cases around the world. However, SARS is much more contagious than Ebola, which means it's easier to hunt. It can spread through sneezing, coughing, sharing drinks, or talking closely with someone with the disease. It is also possible for SARS to travel by air. On the other hand, Ebola is not airborne. Experts say it's only possible to get Ebola through direct contact with a patient's body fluids. Overall, severe acute respiratory syndrome has spread more to many countries than the Ebola virus has so far. However, there were more cases of Ebola, and the number of deaths was much higher. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expect that the number of cases in West Africa will reach hundreds of thousands by January. According to Dr. David Webber, an epidemiologist at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of North Carolina. \" (It) is not really useful to try to determine which is the worst.\" From the point of view of an American citizen who takes into account the impact of the two diseases here, Dr. William Schavener, an infectious pathologist at Vanderbilt University, said that Smiley's statement might have greater weight. The incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to the United States has so far exceeded that of Ebola. (though there were no Sars deaths.) It is also important to remember that the largest focal point for SARS (except Hong Kong) was Toronto - which, as Shafner said, brought the disease a little closer to home. There were 251 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome and 43 deaths in Canada. Even if the number of Ebola cases in the United States is low - less than the number of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases - Smiley is incorrect because of the overall humanitarian impact of Ebola compared to Sars, as Dr. Howard Markle, Director of the Medical History Center at Michigan University said. \"With regard to the United States cases (Ebola) is still the minimum,\" said Markle. \"If you're in West Africa, it's a very dangerous nightmare, and it's already fought far more than Sars.\" Smiley, Governor Ebola, said, \"Not as bad as Sars was in 2003. Both diseases are serious and have affected communities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has spread to more countries and is easier to move from Ebola. However, Ebola had more cases and a higher number of deaths, and these numbers continued to rise. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) may have a greater presence in the United States, but Ebola is about to become a greater humanitarian crisis globally. We're assessing Smiley's claim that he's mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07119"}
