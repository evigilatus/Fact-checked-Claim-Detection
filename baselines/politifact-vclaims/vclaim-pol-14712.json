Ted Strickland, highlighted Strickland\u2019s focus on primary education during his first term in office.\n\nShe noted that the governor increased school funding by 5.5 percent (a claim that we rated as false) and that he committed the state to focus on science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 or STEM. She then said this focus on education is bringing Ohio national recognition.\n\n\"The critics have spoken and every Ohioan should hear what they have to say about our schools,\" she said. \"The Education Commission of the States gave Ohio its award for the most innovative education reform plan in the nation. Education Week rates Ohio schools in the top five in the nation.\"\n\nIndeed, in Education Week\u2019s Quality Counts 2010 report, Ohio\u2019s education system was ranked fifth best in the nation, with an overall grade of B-. But a deeper look behind Education Week\u2019s grading system reveals some less-flattering findings.\n\nTo calculate the overall rankings, the trade publication graded each state on four primary areas. \u00a0Ohio\u2019s rating in some of those areas belies its lofty overall ranking:\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn \u2018Chance for Success,\u2019 a category that gauges how well an Ohio education prepares students for the next stages of their schooling or life, Ohio did not fare well for the number of students attending preschool and for the number of adults with two- or four-year college degrees. Rank: 25th; Grade: C+.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the \u2018School Finance\u2019 category, Ohio again rates in the middle of the pack, despite increasing spending on public education in recent years, as Brown noted. Rank: 18th; Grade: C+.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOhio rated best in the \u2018Standards, Assessment & Accountability\u2019 category, recognized for having well-reasoned and challenging learning objectives and curriculums. Rank: 3rd; Grade: A.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnd in \u2018Teaching Profession,\u2019 an area judging each state\u2019s quality of teachers and strength of its educational leaders, Ohio is considered average. Rank: 14th; Grade: C+.\n\n\n\n\nBrown\u2019s statement is correct about the overall ranking. But we believe it is important to add context to that overall ranking by noting that Ohio received C+ ratings, or barely average, in three of the four areas graded. We rate this statement True.\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14712"}
