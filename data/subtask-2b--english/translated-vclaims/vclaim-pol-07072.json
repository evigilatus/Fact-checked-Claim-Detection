Nathan's deal was taking the wrong approach to saving Hope, it can be said that the most popular nation programme ever was created. The lottery-funded scholarship program was looking for potential bankruptcy. The agreement, the newly elected Governor of Georgia, proposed a series of changes in the programme - the most important of which is that full scholarships will only go to the best and smartest, students with an average of 3.7 points and 1,200 degrees in SAT. However, Carter defended an alternative in 2011 and 2012. His proposal would have placed the so-called income ceiling on the organization &apos; s scholarships. Scholarships will be limited to the rehabilitation of students from households with income of $140,000 or less. The opposition said that this would put the program at equal financial risk, killing only 6% of all Georgian families. The proposed income ceilings have recently resurfaced in the Governor &apos; s tight race between Carter and the deal. The Republicans have broken the announcement of the attack that Carter wants to eliminate scholarships for thousands of middle-class families. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, but Carter seemed to have changed his way of dealing with the income ceiling. At an educational summit earlier this month, Carter said the income ceiling is \"perhaps too loose a tool.\" The aim was to maximize the number of scientists and to consider \"needs without a full ceiling.\" So Carter turned on his website? We found an article from January indicating that Carter had changed from his original call for a maximum income. He still wanted to be paid for some of the needs-based criteria for the HOPE scholarship. But he rejected the idea of the income ceiling, called it \"the very unclear instrument,\" mentioned the magazine. The spokesman for Carter Brian Thomas said that Carter first discussed abandoning the idea of income ceiling with students at the University of Georgia about a year ago. Brian Robinson, spokesman for the deal, said Carter was late for the game. \"It literally took Jason Carter three and a half years to realize that you \"can't pay the price of all\" - a conclusion reached by Republicans and responsible Democrats when they took brave votes to save Hope from bankruptcy.\" We appreciate Carter's heart change on the whole Hope Vopp.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07072"}
