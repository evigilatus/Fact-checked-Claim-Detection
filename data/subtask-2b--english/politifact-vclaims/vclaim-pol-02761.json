That's fake news", "text": "A popular article on Facebook claims that Austria's incoming chancellor Sebastian Kurz has banned George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations from the country.\nThis is a fabricated tale made by a notorious fake news website.\nWith the headline, \"Youngest world leader bans George Soros\u2019s Foundations from Austria,\" the YourNewsWire.com post said that the made-up ban was in response to Soros\u2019 $18 billion donation to the organization, making it the second-biggest philanthropic organization in the United States.\nThe article said that Kurz gave the organization 28 days to \"cease and desist operations in Austria.\" The story falsely said the incoming chancellor called Soros \"the greatest challenge humanity is facing in the world in 2017.\"\nThe fake story goes on to quote Kurz describing\u00a0Soros as \"a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming his blood funnel into anything that smells like money\" \u2014 language identical to a 2010 Rolling Stone piece about Goldman Sachs by Matt Taibbi.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides Soros\u2019 massive donation and Kurz\u2019s young leader status (he\u2019s 31), this story is complete bogus.\nOpen Society Foundations, an organization with efforts in different countries all over the world, has no offices in Austria \u2014 and therefore nothing to \"cease and desist.\"\nWe couldn\u2019t find any record of Kurz describing Soros in that light or commenting on OSF.\nSoros was implicated during Kurz\u2019s campaign when a Facebook page called \"The Truth About Sebastian Kurz\" accused the future chancellor, who supports low levels of immigration, of conspiring with Soros to let in a new wave of refugees. The Facebook page was later found to be set up by a consultant working for Kurz\u2019s opponent, Christian Kern.\nThe article\u2019s birthplace, YourNewsWire.com, is known for producing controversial and often falsified news stories. YourNewsWire.com says it delivers \"the news you want and the news other people won\u2019t report\".\nThis claim is Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02761"}
