Cantor, R-7th District, recently appeared on the \"Squa Wac Fund\" of the Central Committee for Environmental Cooperation to talk about various crises: \"debt crisis,\" \"expenditure crisis,\" and the overall financial crisis that the nation may face if spending is not reduced. Cantor said that the benefits must be addressed, which voted last month in favour of the budget plan of the Republican House of Representatives that would redesign the system of medical care and medical aid. Cantor refused to increase tax rates. However, he recognized the need for a \"growth-supporting tax proposal\" that would eliminate some interest and gap tax cuts to modestly increase revenues. \"We also have a situation in this country where you're approaching 50 percent of people who don't even pay income taxes,\" he said. Is it true that half the Americans don't pay income tax? Let's take a look. First, a technical note. When Cantor says people, it means \"tax statistics units,\" which refer to individuals or couples who either make a tax declaration or would have earned it if they had earned enough income, according to his employees. In support of his assertion, the Cantor camp provided a variety of studies and media reports indicating that about 50 per cent of households in the United States did not owe a federal income tax in 2009 -- the latest tax data available in the year. In 2009, for example, the Centre for Tax Policy projected that 47 per cent of people would not pay an income tax in that year, up from the previous estimate of 38 per cent - largely due to additional tax exemptions through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act 2009. However, this is a little old history. - Anything new? The Joint Tax Commission sent a letter to Congress on this matter just days after Cantor appeared in the \"crowding box.\" With the use of tax data for 2009, the Committee estimated that just over 50 per cent of tax units had not paid any income tax. \"In summary, for the 2009 tax year, about 22 per cent of all tax units, including filers and non-reporters, will have zero income tax obligations, about 30 per cent will receive a refundable tax credit and about 49 per cent will have a positive tax obligation on income tax,\" says the letter. \"That's consistent with the numbers we've got,\" said Robertson Williams of the Centre for Tax Policy. \"The main reason is that we do not use the tax system specifically to collect taxes; we use it to collect taxes and to introduce social policy.\" \"Because of that we end up giving people money that can be saved to them through spending programs.\" However, because the United States uses the tax system to distribute funds, it reduces tax liability by 51 per cent of tax registration units to zero or less. Williams said that this was largely due to common tax exemptions, or tax expenditures. \"There are many and many of them. We estimate that they total more than $1 trillion a year in reduced taxes and in fact most of them go to the highest end of income distribution.\" However, since high-income holders bear a lot of responsibility for income, breaks still keep them down to zero. However, low- and middle-income popular incomes, such as earned tax exemptions, child credit and mortgage interest discounts, make the majority of the population out of control. Let's look back. Cantor acknowledged the need to remove some of the tax gaps and cuts, while also pointing out that \"we also have a situation in this country where we approach 50% of people who don't pay income taxes.\" We are not only approaching that situation, but, as the Joint Tax Commission pointed out shortly after the Cantor statement, we are moving beyond it. Therefore, what the majority leader said is true. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech.
