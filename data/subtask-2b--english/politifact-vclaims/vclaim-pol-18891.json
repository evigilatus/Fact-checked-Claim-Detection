Its data shows Spanberger and Pelosi agreed on 92% of the votes they both cast in this Congress, which began at the start of 2019.\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about this statistic.\nFirst, majority parties vote overwhelmingly with the speaker, whom they elect. Spanberger is one of the least loyal Democrats to Pelosi. There are 232 Democrats in the House, and only 10 have voted in greater opposition to Pelosi than Spanberger.\nMore than half of the Democrats - 133 in total -\u00a0 have agreed with Pelosi every time she\u2019s voted this Congress. Even the most contrary Democrat - Collin Peterson of Minnesota - has voted with her 81% \u00a0of the time.\u00a0\nAlso keep in mind that speakers vote at their discretion, which means they usually vote only on the most partisanly-charged issues.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe votes\nPelosi has participated in 9% of the House votes this session. That\u2019s 74 votes, and Spanberger has agreed with her 68 times. They\u2019ve been in sync on most major issues, including:\n\nImpeaching President Donald Trump on two counts of malfeasance;\u00a0\u00a0\nExpanding Obamacare;\nIncreasing the minimum wage;\nOverturning emergency funding for a border wall;\nCreating a path to citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants;\u00a0\nRequiring background checks on all gun sales;\nPolice reforms; and\nKeeping the U.S. in the environmental Paris Accords.\n\nOf their six disagreeing votes, three concerned the Heroes Act - a $3 trillion tax cut and spending bill the House approved in May to spur the COVID-19 economy. Pelosi supported it. Spanberger voted against it, saying it was bloated with Democratic wish-list items. The bill is stalled in the Senate.\nSpanberger voted against a budget deal last year that Pelosi negotiated, saying it would greatly enlarge the national debt. They also disagreed on a bill that would ban the manufacture and sale of flavored e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes, which Spanberger opposed; and an amendment that would require customs official to be notified when an undocumented alien tries to buy a gun, which Spanberger backed.\u00a0\nIt should be noted that Spanberger didn\u2019t support Pelosi\u2019s election as speaker at the start of 2019 - an action not counted in ProPublica\u2019s database. But even if it had been included, Spanberger would remain above the 90% level Freitas set for agreeing with the speaker.\u00a0\nWe should also note that Republicans are criticizing their opponents\u2019 voting percentage with Pelosi in key races across the country. That includes Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District race, where Rep. Elaine Luria, a Democrat, is being challenged by Republican Scott Taylor.\nOur ruling\nFreitas says Spanberger has voted with Nancy Pelosi over 90% of the time.\" Let\u2019s remember that only 10 Democrats voted against Pelosi more often than Spanberger.\nBut Freitas' statistic is solid; Spanberger and Pelosi\u00a0agreed on 92 percent of the votes they both\u00a0participated in. So we rate Freitas\u2019 statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18891"}
