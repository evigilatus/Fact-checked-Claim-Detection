For a decade, he has lent his presence and fame to help the United Nations agency in its work with children around the world.\nA video posted on Facebook showed Beckham\u2019s visit to Swaziland, a landlocked nation on the border between South Africa and Mozambique that has just over 1 million people. In the video, which has been viewed more than 1.3 million times, Beckham said \"Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world.\"\nThat statistic checks out.\nHere\u2019s the research behind it.\nThere are two ways to talk about the reach of HIV/AIDS (or any disease for that matter). There\u2019s prevalence, which tells you the fraction of people who are infected with the virus at any particular time. And there\u2019s incidence, which tells you how many new people get infected in a given year.\nSwaziland tops the rankings for both.\nUNAIDS, the United Nations group focused on HIV/AIDS, reports that last year, HIV prevalence among adults 15-49 in Swaziland was 28.8 percent of the population -- more than 1 out of 4. The incidence rate was 2.36 per 100 person-years. These charts, drawn from UNAIDS data, back up Beckham\u2019s claim.\nThe CIA World Factbook has the same rankings, although the actual numbers vary a bit. A survey published in 2012 by the Swaziland Ministry of Health found slightly higher rates -- 31 percent prevalence and 2.4 percent incidence -- but that would certainly leave the ranking unchanged.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy so high?\nKate Grabowski and Ronald Gray at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told us that a constellation of factors led to what Gray called \"an unmitigated disaster\" in Swaziland. Researchers debate the relative importance of certain drivers, but a lack of HIV treatment and prevention, as well as migration patterns and social structures all likely play a role.\nIn Swaziland, there are \"very high rates of polygamy,\" Gray said, plus many men work as miners in South Africa and Botswana where prostitution is common.\nThat could explain the high rate, but as far as Swaziland\u2019s top rank among nations, that might have more to do with its small size.\nGrabowski noted that in some ways, Swaziland resembles other HIV hot spots.\n\"There are other communities that are not necessarily countries which also have high HIV prevalence,\" Grabowski said. \"Unfortunately Swaziland gets highlighted because it happens to be one of those places and it is also a country.\"\nOur ruling\nBeckham said that Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV in the world. Official numbers back that up. Whether you look at how many people are infected with HIV at any moment, or how many new infections emerge in a year, Swaziland is worse off than any other nation.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04817"}
