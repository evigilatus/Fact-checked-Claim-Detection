The original poster attributed the information to A-Z Facts, but a web search for that source only turned up websites for children with facts about animals and the state of Arizona.\nThe first of the three images used in the Facebook post appears to be of the Bronze Horseman, a monument in St. Petersburg, Russia, to Peter the Great. The horse has its front legs in the air but Peter the Great died of gangrene, not in battle.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second image appears to be of the Virginia Washington Monument, showing George Washington on a horse with one leg aloft.

It\u2019s true that George didn\u2019t die in battle, or afterward from wounds. He consumed \"prodigious amounts of drugs\" and cherry brandy before his death, according to the BBC.\nAs Snopes has noted, most of Gettysburg\u2019s equestrian statues abide by this alleged horse hoof pattern with James Longstreet being an exception. Still, there are plenty of other statues that buck it. Among them: Simon Bolivar, Andrew Jackson and Stonewall Jackson.\nWe rate this statement as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01394"}
