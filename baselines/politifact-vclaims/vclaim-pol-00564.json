She asked him to vote for the federal Equality Act, which would ban discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity.\nThen she wrote:\n\"A recent study shows that over 64 percent of Tennesseeans support laws for protection of LGBTQ people against discrimination. Reports are that the majority of Americans across ALL parties favor these nondiscrimination policies for LGBTQ people (liberals at 81%, moderates at 76% and conservatives at 55%).\"\nWe wondered if, on a national level, LGBTQ support is as strong as Swift says it is.\nSupport generally for non-discrimination\nSwift relies on a poll done by PRRI (Public Religion Research Institute), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. It\u2019s the most recent poll we found that\u2019s on point.\nPolling was done in 40,000 landline and cellphone interviews from March 2018 through December 2018 under the supervision of Pennsylvania-based SSRS, a survey research firm. Several polling experts told us that PRRI specializes in polling in this topic area and that PRRI and SSRS do solid work.\nThe key question was:\n\"Do you strongly favor, favor, oppose or strongly oppose laws that would protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations and housing?\"\nIn releasing the poll results in March 2019, PRRI said:\n\"Majorities of Democrats (79%), independents (70%) and Republicans (56%) say they favor laws that would shield LGBT people from various kinds of discrimination. \u2026 Majorities of liberals (81%), moderates (76%) and conservatives (55%) all favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people.\"\nSo, based on the poll, Swift is correct in saying that majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans support nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people, at least when it comes to jobs, public accommodations and housing. And she accurately cites figures for liberals, moderates and conservatives.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
