We have the longest surviving constitution. \u2026 What we don't have is leadership.\"\n\nThe rule of law in America is hard to question, and as for presidential leadership, we'll leave that to the candidates to debate. But, does America really have the world's longest surviving Constitution? That sounded like a question for PolitiFact.\n\nTo start, we went straight to the source, the National Constitution Center, located on Independence Mall in Philadelphia.\n\nAt 222 years old, America\u2019s governing document is broadly considered the world\u2019s longest surviving constitution, according to Dr. Steven Frank, the Constitution Center\u2019s chief historian.\n\nRatified in 1789, it beats out Norway\u2019s constitution, which took effect in 1814 and Belgium's, implemented in 1831, according to a list compiled by Tom Ginsburg and Rosalind Dixon, constitutional law professors at the University of Chicago.\n\n\"It's the most durable constitution in the world today,\" said Frank, of the Constitution Center. \"Historians agree. It's been around longer than any other written constitution.\"\n\nBut, that left us to wonder, what constitutes a constitution?\n\nThe definition of the term is a significant question in political theory, according to Ginsburg, the University of Chicago law professor. But the term is loosely defined as a collection of laws or governing statutes that \"sets fundamental norms about the structure of government and its relationship with citizens,\" Ginsburg wrote in an e-mail. He also serves as one of the lead investigators for the Comparative Constitutions Project, a research project launched at the University of Illinois to analyze governing documents around the world.\n\nIn their study, project researchers have found that enduring constitutions are usually made easy to amend to allow for growth and re-interpretation, Ginsburg said, and they are typically written by large cross-sections of people to encompass many points of view.\n\n\"The funny thing is, the things which make constitutions endure aren't really found in the U.S. one,\" he said, pointing out that the United States Constitution was written by 100 rich, white men. \"It seems to be very exceptional, the reason it endures.\"\n\nElsewhere around the globe, many countries don\u2019t follow a single constitution but instead operate under what historians call a \"multi-text approach,\" in which national laws are based on different documents and statutes, many of which pre-date the United States Constitution.\n\nThe United Kingdom, for instance, derives its constitution from a large number of documents, including the Magna Carta, which dates back to 1297, according to Jef Ruchti, editor-in-chief of World Constitutions Illustrated, a publication of William S. Hein, & Co.\n\n\"All told, it is traditional to consider that the U.S. Constitution is the oldest surviving one-document constitutional text. However, the others models do outdate it,\" Ruchti wrote in an e-mail. \"And that is not even getting into the continuing debate as to whether the form of government of the Iroquois Nations had an impact on the writing of the U.S. Constitution or not.\"\n\nThe republic of San Marino \u00a0is often considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect. The republic, an enclave surrounded by Italy, has no formal constitution, but instead is governed by the Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini, a series of six books, written in Latin in the late 16th Century that dictates the country\u2019s political system, among other matters.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nHistorians and legal scholars alike may debate the definition, but most of us are clear in our concept of a constitution as a single governing document. As long as that\u2019s the case, there is little room for argument. The U.S. Constitution is the longest surviving constitution in the world. Still, there are other countries that have multiple governing documents that are older than the U.S. Constitution.\n\nWe rate Huntsman\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
