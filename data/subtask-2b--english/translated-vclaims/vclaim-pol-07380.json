Despite the concerns of many Americans, experts in infectious diseases - including disease control centers - say that there is very little chance that the US will suffer from the Ebola outbreak. Compared to West Africa, America has well-resourced health-care services, as well as federal programmes and agencies dedicated to preventing public health crises in the United States. But this is not thanks to the Republic, Tom Cotton, as the current democratic tooth says, Mark Brewer in his last announcement. Pryor runs against Cotton, the Republican, to keep his seat. \"Tom Cotton voted against America's preparation for epidemics like Ebola,\" says the novelist in the Declaration. The voice of the Congolese Cotton to cut off billions of medical disasters and emergency programs in our country He was the only congressman in Arkansas who voted that way. It's like he's the only one who voted against the children's hospital. Instead, Cotton voted massive tax cuts for the billionaire. We do not protect the health and safety of our families. &quot; As a Republican Tea Party, Cotton has a history of voting against federal government spending, including on disaster relief. But tying Cotton to a possible Ebola outbreak has caught our attention. This year &apos; s vote killed more than 1,400 people in West Africa as of 20 August, the largest ever recorded outbreak, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). No cases were recorded in the United States, although two United States health-care workers were infected with HIV while in Liberia and treated in a hospital in Atlanta. We asked the Prueur campaign to provide evidence to support their claim, and they said that the announcement referred to the Reauthorization of Pandemic Preparedness and All Types of Hazard Act 2013. The Law - promulgated in March 2013 - continues to fund various medical and emergency preparedness programmes in the area of public health until 2018. (The first version of the Act was approved in 2006) As you may guess from the name, the law is about preventing epidemics, such as Ebola, from outbreak in the United States. Several law-funded programmes are already working to address Ebola, such as the Research and Advanced Development in Biomedicine, and Gretchen Michaels, a spokesman for the Assistant Minister for Preparedness and Response (under the United States Department of Health and Human Services). In addition, the re-licence of the 2013 Act gave the Food and Drug Administration the ability to authorize the use of unapproved products in case of emergency. Therefore, earlier this month, FDA authorized the use of a new Ebola diagnostic tool, as well as experimental treatment. On January 31, 2021, Ryan Fornier said on Twitter, \"Baiden's administration has lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\" Noah Y. Kim wrote: 1 February 2021 Did Cotton try to stop this legislation? At first, it seems so. The Council passed legislation on 22 January 2013, with strong support from both parties and very few opposition - 395 to 29. Cotton voted against it, along with 28 other Republicans. The bill moved to the Senate, where legislators made some changes, approved it with a voice vote, and returned it to the House of Representatives for approval of the changes. The Chamber of Deputies once again approved the Senate version of the bill by an overwhelming majority of both parties. This time, Cotton changed his position and voted in favour of the bill. Seven other Republicans who voted \"no\" changed their vote, too. It is not clear why Cotton did not vote for the first time. The law allowed for such a simple debate that it did not show much interest on the part of the media. We contacted Cotton's campaign, but we didn't answer that -- although they posted an article on their website that refuted the claim. According to CQ Weekly, the main difference between the House of Representatives and the Senate version of the Act is that the House of Representatives version approves funding and programs until 2017, while the Senate version continues until 2018. We also used a tool to compare the differences between the two texts and found that the final version contained a clause clarifying that State and local workers who were required to perform a temporary different function in an emergency would not be required to accept such reassignment. Notwithstanding this, the country &apos; s ability to respond to any epidemic does not depend on either of these changes. There is no evidence available that Cotton has launched an active campaign against the bill. And the final version, which got Cotton's vote, also got positive votes from almost every Senate and Democratic Council -- including Brewer. \"Tom Cotton voted against America's preparation for epidemics like Ebola.\" Cotton voted against one version of the 2013 pandemic and emergency preparedness bill. However, Cotton voted in favour of the final version, which was also endorsed by Brewer. It is easy for the draft law to become law. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, so we often assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07380"}
