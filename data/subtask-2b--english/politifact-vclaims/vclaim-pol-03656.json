Rick Scott paints fellow Republicans as job-killers for Enterprise Florida, Visit Florida votes", "text": "Gov. Rick Scott is painting fellow Republicans as job-killers for their support of a bill that would decimate the state\u2019s agencies for tourism promotion and business incentives.\nScott has escalated his feud with House Speaker Richard Corcoran by calling out legislators on their own turf for votes in committee to dismantle Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida. Scott credits these two groups for helping usher 1.2 million private-sector jobs into the state since he was elected.\nIn his view, a vote to eliminate the agencies is a vote against jobs.\nAt a stop of the \"Fighting for Florida\u2019s Jobs\" tour in Flagler Beach, Scott targeted the bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast.\n\"Your politicians in Tallahassee today are saying, in your area, that they don't need any more jobs,\" Scott said Feb. 13 to business leaders and constituents at Vessel Sandwich Co. \"That is exactly what Rep. Paul Renner said.\"\nScott continued, \"He said, 'I will sponsor the bill to eliminate marketing for tourists.' He sponsored the bill to do that and to get rid of Visit Florida.\"\nScott is using the jobs argument a lot lately (though not for the employees who work at the agencies).\n\u2022 \"When they want to say we don\u2019t want to do any more marketing for Visit Florida, what they are saying is that we don\u2019t need any more jobs in tourism.\" (Miami Herald)\n\u2022\u00a0\"It\u2019s pretty clear, if you\u2019re not caring about people\u2019s jobs you must be caring about something else,\" he said. \"I care about people\u2019s jobs. What else can it be?\" (Miami Herald)\n\u2022\u00a0\"How can anybody say they don\u2019t want to help a poor family get a job?\" (Miami Herald)\nHis attack against Renner misrepresents Renner's view. There is no record of Renner saying exactly that his area doesn't need more jobs.\nScott press secretary Kerri Wyland said Scott\u2019s point is focused on the effect of Renner\u2019s proposal.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By choosing to sponsor this job-killing legislation, Rep. Renner is telling families in the counties he serves that the area does not need more jobs,\" she said.\nRenner doesn\u2019t see the legislation as a crusade against jobs. He jokingly offered $100 to anyone who heard those words come out of his mouth.\nWhen he introduced the bill, Renner brought up a\u00a0philosophical difference with Scott about the fairness of economic incentives, arguing the money could be better spent to benefit more people.\n\"We should be taking the hundreds of millions of dollars we\u2019re spending on the privileged few \u2014 those few companies that are able to navigate the system \u2014 for broad-based tax reform,\" Renner said Feb. 8 at the House Careers and Competition Subcommittee meeting. \"Tax reform that benefits all businesses, small, medium and large, and if we do that we will continue to be one of the leading states in the country for job growth.\"\nIn an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Renner said he\u00a0prefers tax money to be invested in public safety, infrastructure and education \u2014 not marketing campaigns (see \"Sexy Beaches\") or incentives. He\u2019s also disappointed in executives for awarding bonuses and increasing salaries of executives with state dollars.\nAs for the jobs situation in Renner's area, the unemployment rate for Flagler County (home to Flagler Beach and Renner's Palm Coast) has been slightly higher than the state average but not alarmingly so. In December 2016, the Florida rate was 4.9 percent, compared with 5.4 percent (preliminary) in Flagler. That's down from the county's 12.3 percent rate in December 2010, before Scott took office.\nScott may be hoping the legislation is a turnoff in Renner\u2019s district, but he has some competition from the other side. Americans For Prosperity Florida started mailing fliers to Renner\u2019s constituents, urging them to continue to support Renner\u2019s efforts to dismantle a \"rigged\" system.\nAnd on Feb. 15, a video\u00a0was posted on the Florida House of Representatives YouTube\u00a0page.\u00a0It uses clips of news reports about failed projects and ends with President Ronald Reagan.\n\"I am sure he was speaking figuratively when he said that we're not in favor of jobs,\" Renner said of Scott. \"The Florida House is full of people who believe in jobs and prosperity for everyone.\"\nOur ruling\nScott said, \"Politicians in Tallahassee today are saying, in your area, that they don't need any more jobs. That is exactly what Rep. Paul Renner said.\"\nThat is not exactly what Renner said, and it misleads voters about the issue.\nRenner supports legislation to eliminate funding for Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida, which Scott says will cost Florida jobs -- ergo, Renner supports losing jobs.\u00a0Renner, naturally, sees it differently. He thinks the money would be better devoted to tax cuts.\nThe picture is far more complex than the broad brush Scott paints.\u00a0We rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8eb24b73-95e0-4338-92e4-02efd17c768c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03656"}
