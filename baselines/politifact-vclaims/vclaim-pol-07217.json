Scott Walker could backfire on students.\nIf state aid to tech schools isn\u2019t boosted at the same time, the candidate for governor argues, a tuition freeze could force elimination of in-demand courses.\nBurke doesn\u2019t rule out backing a tuition freeze herself if she wins the Nov. 4, 2014 election. But she says it\u2019s more important to get financial support to students so they can afford to go to school -- such as by increasing state aid to keep college affordable.\n\"The bigger issue I think is we have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities, and most of those people are on the waitlist for tech colleges,\" Burke said during a Sept. 22, 2014 interview by Wisconsin Eye.\nWere that many students turned down?\nTo back her claim, Burke\u2019s campaign pointed us to a July 31, 2014 memo prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for state Sen. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse). We also tracked down a later memo from the agency dated Aug. 19, 2014.\nBoth memos examined Wisconsin Grants, the state-funded program that gives need-based grants to undergraduate students enrolled at least half-time in one of four sectors: UW-System institutions, tech colleges, private and nonprofit schools or tribal colleges. You must be a state resident to receive the money.\nAll told, the state spent about $106 million in 2013-\u201914 on the grants.\nThough perhaps not as well known as federal financial aid programs, the state program helps a lot of people.\nAt UW schools and tech schools alone, nearly 57,000 students received grants for the 2013-\u201914 year.\nUW schools receive an allotment, and the tech schools work from a separate pot of money. The average grant for a UW student was $1,775; for tech students, $994.\nIn the tech system, it\u2019s first-come, first-served for the grants. In the UW System, it\u2019s first-come, first-served until each campus\u2019 allocation is spent.\nIn the 2013-\u201914 year, more than 41,000 financial aid applicants who were eligible for state help did not get any due to lack of funds, according to the Fiscal Bureau memo.\nMore than nine out of 10 of those rejected were tech-school applicants, the memo said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fiscal Bureau figures are on target, according to John Reinemann, executive secretary of the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board, which administers the grants, and Conor Smyth, director of Strategic Partnerships and External Relations for the Wisconsin Technical College System.\nThose who did not get a grant are put on a list in case they are still in school if grant money becomes available.\nDemand started to exceed supply of grant money during the Great Recession, when more people were returning to school for retraining and diminished incomes meant \u00a0many more were eligible to receive aid.\nThe \"unmet need\" reached as high as 80,000 in 2009, statistics show. The tech schools alone saw 54,000 applicants get turned down in 2012.\nA word about the numbers\nThere\u2019s somewhat less than meets the eye with the waiting list figures, however.\nThere\u2019s some potential -- though apparently relatively minor -- overlap between the UW System and the Wisconsin Technical College System figures.\nThe tech schools put you on a waiting list if you are eligible for one of their awards, and you listed a tech school as the number one choice on your financial aid application.\nThe Fiscal Bureau points out it\u2019s not known how many of those applicants actually enroll at a tech school. They might have enrolled in a UW or private college instead -- and might even have secured a grant from one of those institutions.\nAnd while some may have done so because they didn\u2019t get a tech-school grant, others went a different route for other reasons.\nThis situation means the tech school list likely overstates the unmet need to some extent, \u00a0Fiscal Bureau analyst Emily Pope wrote. Conversely, the UW list -- which includes only students who actually enrolled in a UW school -- likely understates it because it doesn\u2019t include applicants who may have enrolled there if they had received a UW grant,\nSo for all those reasons, the 41,000 waitlist figure is the best we have, but not rock solid.\nOur rating\nBurke said: \"We have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities,\" most of them for tech schools.\nThere is a large waiting list, and Burke cites a credible source on its size.\nBut some variations in how the lists are defined by the different institutions mean the number should be treated with some caution.\nWe rate her claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07217"}
