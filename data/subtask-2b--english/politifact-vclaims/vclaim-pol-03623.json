Gov. Gavin Newsom urged Trump in a letter to follow the hands-off pot approach he claimed Trump had promised during his campaign.\n\"A Quinnipiac poll released yesterday says that 71-percent of US voters (say) that the government should not interfere with states that passed legalized marijuana and during your campaign, you committed to honoring states\u2019 rights when it comes to marijuana legalization,\" Newsom wrote on Feb. 24, 2017.\n\nNewsom also helped write California\u2019s voter-approved ballot measure, Proposition 64, that legalized recreational marijuana last November. He is running for California governor in 2018.\nWe wanted to know whether Newsom was right: Had Trump \"committed\" during his campaign to leaving recreational pot up to the states?\nOur research\nNewsom\u2019s spokesman pointed to three examples during his campaign where Trump said marijuana legalization should be up to the states.\n\n\nIn a television interview on July 29, 2016 with KUSA-TV in Colorado, Trump said: \"I wouldn\u2019t do that [using federal authority to shut down recreational marijuana], no \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t do that \u2026 I think it\u2019s up to the states, yeah. I\u2019m a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely.\"\n\n\nIn a radio interview with WWJ Newsradio 950 in Michigan on March 8, 2016, Trump said \"I think it certainly has to be a state \u2014 I have not smoked it \u2014 it\u2019s got to be a state decision \u2026 \u00a0I do like it, you know, from a medical standpoint \u2026 it does do pretty good things. But from the other standpoint, I think that it should be up to the states.\"\n\n\nAt a campaign rally in Sparks, Nevada on Oct. 29, 2015, Trump said: \"The marijuana thing is such a big thing. I think medical should happen \u2014 right? Don\u2019t we agree? I think so. And then I really believe we should leave it up to the states. It should be a state situation ... but I believe that the legalization of marijuana \u2013 other than for medical because I think medical, you know I know people that are very, very sick and for whatever reason the marijuana really helps them - \u2026 but in terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state.\"\n\n\n\nTrump speaks at a campaign rally in Sparks, Nevada in October 2015 about marijuana legalization.\nTrump\u2019s comment at the Sparks rally was also recorded in a Washington Post news article at the time with the headline \"Trump softens position on marijuana legalization.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA different view?\nNewsom\u2019s spokesman did not include a fourth high-profile example where Trump discussed legal pot, one that somewhat contradicts Trump\u2019s other comments on the topic.\nIn an interview with Trump on Fox News on Feb. 11, 2016, host Bill O\u2019Reilly described Colorado\u2019s experience legalizing pot as leading to \"... all of the dealers, all of the pushers are going to Colorado, loading up on the free pot because it\u2019s legal, not free -- legal and then zooming around the country selling it. Does that concern you?\"\nTrump responded saying he favors medical marijuana \"100 percent.\"\n\"But what you are talking about (with recreational marijuana), perhaps not. It's causing a lot of problems out there,\" Trump added.\nTrump doesn\u2019t bring up states rights in this interview.\nBut in his subsequent interviews, with the Michigan radio station in March 2016 and the Colorado television station in July 2016, he returns to his line that states should decide the matter.\nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has strongly opposed marijuana legalization. He told reporters on Feb. 27, 2017 that: \"States they can pass the laws they choose. I would just say it does remain a violation of federal law to distribute marijuana throughout any place in the United States, whether a state legalizes it or not.\"\nLong before running for president, Trump voiced strong opinions on drug legalization. In April 1990 in an article in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Trump said the United States should legalize drugs and use the money collected to educate the public on the dangers of drug use. \"We're losing badly the war on drugs,\" Trump said at the time, according to the article. \"You have to legalize drugs to win that war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars.\"\nOur ruling\nCalifornia Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed Donald Trump, during his campaign for president, \"committed to honoring states' rights when it comes to marijuana legalization.\"\nIn at least three campaign interviews, Trump said he thought the issue of legalizing marijuana should be left to the states.\nThis wasn\u2019t one of Trump\u2019s high-profile promises like building a wall on the Southern border. And he did not address marijuana in his major campaign speeches.\nBut he did make clear, multiple times, how he felt when asked.\nIn a separate interview on Fox News, Trump expressed concern over legal pot in Colorado. But in two subsequent interviews he returned to his line that the matter should be decided by the states.\nIn the end, Trump\u2019s own words back Newsom\u2019s claim.\nWe rated it True.\n\nTRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    0 6  Politifact Rating: True  During his campaign for president, Donald Trump \"committed to honoring states' rights when it comes to marijuana legalization.\"    Gavin Newsom California Lt.
