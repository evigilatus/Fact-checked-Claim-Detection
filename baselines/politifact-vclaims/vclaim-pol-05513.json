We decided to take a closer look.\nWhat tuition cost\nThe easier part of this equation to nail down is the average cost of college tuition.\nAccording to the U.S. Education Department, average undergraduate tuition and fees -- excluding room and board -- in the 1965-66 school year was $607 per year for a four-year college (public and private) and $203 for a two-year college. (Adding room and board bumps up those figures to $1,375 and $884, respectively, but O\u2019Malley said \"tuition,\" so we won\u2019t consider room and board.)\nWhat the average GM worker made\nAccording to an article in the Aug. 25, 1964, edition of the Chicago Tribune, the average hourly wage in the auto industry that year was $3.01. That grew a bit after a new union contract was negotiated later that year, but a figure in that ballpark is about right for the time frame O\u2019Malley was talking about, said Kristin Dziczek, director of the industry and labor group at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. Historical wage data from Ford, for instance, shows that the base wage for a \"major assembler\" was $2.91 an hour in 1965.\nDziczek noted that workers in durable-goods manufacturing averaged 44 hours per week in 1965, with time-and-a-half for the final four hours. So a $3.10-an-hour wage (accounting for the increase in the 1964 UAW contract) would work out to $142.60 per week, or $285.20\u00a0for the two-week period O\u2019Malley cites.\nSo if you ignore taxes -- a questionable policy, but one we\u2019ll grant O\u2019Malley for the sake of argument -- then two weeks of average GM pay would have been enough to pay for one year at the typical two-year college in 1965. But it would not be enough to pay for a year at typical four-year college. That would take a little more than four weeks\u2019 work.\nWhat the O\u2019Malley campaign says\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe O\u2019Malley campaign said they took the wage number from a column by University of California-Berkeley economist Robert Reich, who also served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. In 2014, Reich wrote. \"Fifty\u00a0years ago, when General Motors was the largest employer in America, the typical GM worker got paid $35 an hour in today\u2019s dollars.\"\nBut that works out to $4.66 an hour in 1965 dollars,\u00a0and contemporary evidence suggests that wage is about 50 percent too high.\nMeanwhile, on the tuition side of the equation, the O\u2019Malley campaign said that one year of in-state, undergraduate tuition at University of Iowa in the 1964-65 school year cost $340, and that this was the case for other states, as well, such as New Hampshire.\nHowever, if you use the $3.10-an-hour wage -- rather than Reich\u2019s $4.66-an-hour wage -- then two weeks\u2019 pay, even when untaxed, would not quite cover a year\u2019s in-state tuition at the University of Iowa. And since many GM workers wouldn\u2019t have been residents of Iowa, and thus eligible for the in-state rate at the University of Iowa, we think it\u2019s fairer to look at average tuition nationally.\nComparing 1965 to today\nSo O\u2019Malley\u2019s comparison doesn\u2019t quite hold up. However, it\u2019s fair to note that he has a point about\u00a0the larger question. Namely, it was a whole lot more realistic to be able to pay for a year of tuition with just a few weeks of blue-collar income in 1965 than it is now.\nDuring the 2012-13 school year, a year\u2019s tuition at the average four-year college was $14,101, and the base wage at Ford for a major assembler was $28.13 an hour. If you include overtime pay, then two 44-hour weeks at that wage (without setting aside anything for taxes) works out to about $2,700, or less than 20 percent of the one-year average tuition cost. At that rate, it would take more than 10 weeks\u2019 work, including some overtime, to pay for a year\u2019s worth of tuition.\nWe should note that the rise of college tuition costs is the bigger culprit here. In nominal dollars, auto worker wages have grown ninefold since 1965. But average four-year-college tuition is up 23 times from what it was in 1965.\nOur ruling\nO\u2019Malley said, \"Fifty years ago, the average GM employee could pay for a year of a son or daughter\u2019s college tuition on just two weeks wages.\"\nThat\u2019s not quite right -- it would have taken about four weeks of work at GM, not two, to pay for a year at the average four-year college in 1965, and more than that if you take account of taxes. Still, O\u2019Malley has a point that\u00a0the situation in 1965 was quite a deal compared to today, when a typical auto worker would have to work for 10 weeks in order to pay for a year of tuition at the average four-year college. We rate the statement Mostly True.\nCORRECTION, Feb. 2, 2016: The calculations in our original version slightly overstated the typical weekly and biweekly wages for UAW workers. A $3.10-an-hour wage (accounting for the increase in the 1964 UAW contract) would work out to $142.60 per week, or $285.20 for the two-week period Martin O\u2019Malley cited. The difference does not affect the final rating.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05513"}
