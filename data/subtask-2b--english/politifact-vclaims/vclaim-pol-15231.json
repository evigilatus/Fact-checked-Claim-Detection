Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus that state agencies submit plans for cutting 5 percent of their general revenue budgets. Experts say lawmakers could face a shortfall of $11 billion or more in projected revenue when they gather again in 2011.\n\nIn their Jan. 15 letter to the agencies, the leaders said \"reducing direct services should be your last option, but should be identified, if necessary, in order to meet the 5 percent target.\" Decisions on the agencies\u2019 proposals are expected within six weeks.\n\nThe Agriculture Department\u2019s proposal, submitted Feb. 15, listed $7.2 million in possible cuts, the largest a $2 million reduction to a program that gives grants to organizations that serve meals \u2014 a direct service \u2014 to homebound Texans who are elderly or disabled. The cuts would reduce the program\u2019s grant money for 2010 and 2011 by 10 percent.\n\n\"Reduced funding would likely impact the number of meals served to elderly and disabled Texans by eligible organizations,\" the department\u2019s plan states. Bryan Black, a department spokesman, said the agency does not know exactly what the impact would be because recipients of grants \u2014 192 were awarded for 2010 \u2014 can use the money for things besides food, including salary, equipment and transportation costs.\n\nWe also wondered if Gilbert is correct that \"many\" of the recipients of the meal aid are veterans.\n\nThe Gilbert campaign said it did not have figures to support the veterans reference. Black said the Agriculture Department doesn\u2019t track whether veterans are among meal recipients.\n\nHowever, a spokeswoman for Meals on Wheels and More, an Austin recipient of the grant money, told us that about 30 percent of the organization\u2019s clients are men, and a \"significant\" share of those are Vietnam and World War II veterans. Dan Pruett, president of the local Meals on Wheels, said the grant money from the Agriculture Department had improved the group\u2019s ability to serve the older population.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s Gilbert\u2019s statement that the food delivery grants were targeted because Staples was trying to appeal to his \"right-wing\" base.\n\nThat\u2019s the sort of speculative political claim that our fact-checking team doesn\u2019t usually address, but we were curious about Gilbert\u2019s reasoning. An explanation came from Vince Leibowitz,\u00a0 a spokesman for the Gilbert campaign, who said Staples\u2019 action signals to conservatives that he\u2019s willing to trim what they consider to be frivolous social programs.\n\nBlack said that proposed reductions to state-funded grant programs were made equitably and that none was singled out for larger cuts.\n\nSumming up: Gilbert accurately described part of the Agriculture Department\u2019s budget-cutting proposal. But it\u2019s misleading to suggest that the food program was targeted for reduction. Nor did Gilbert present any evidence that Staples suggested the cuts to pander to his right-wing supporters.\n\nWe rate his statement Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
