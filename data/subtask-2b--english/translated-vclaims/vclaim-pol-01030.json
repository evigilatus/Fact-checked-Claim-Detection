The company said that it would build a $10 billion facility in Mount Pleasant to manufacture LCD plates, and eventually use 13,000. These figures have sometimes appeared in doubt, including in January 2019, when news reports reported that the company was retracting or delaying its plans. The President of the Assembly, Robin Voss, War-Rochester, and the majority leader of the Senate, Scott Fitzgerald, R-Jonao, issued a joint statement on the status of the company in January 30, 2019. They have covered a lot of land, including some of the areas we have already verified. They blamed the new Goof. Tony Evers, a Democrat, for the Foxcon gossip that we assessed with pants on fire. They said \"no one dollar\" in the state's money will go to Foxcon until jobs are created -- which we've mostly established are true. \"In a short time, Foxcon had a positive impact all over Wisconsin with more than 1,000 new jobs, an investment of $200 million, three innovation centres and one of the largest gifts ever 100 million to UW-Madison,\" said Voss and Fitzgerald. The job claim has caught our attention. Was Foxcon responsible for four numbers in Wisconsin's job? The figure includes construction functions when requesting support for the claim, Voss, the spokesperson for Kate Bayer, referred to a letter from 17 January 2019 sent to State officials detailing the impact of the work so far. According to the letter, Foxcon \"created 1,032 direct and many indirect jobs to support the Wisconsin project. This figure includes 178 full-time Foxcon employees and 854 employees involved in the construction (Foxcon campus), who reside in 54 counties in Wisconsin.\" On January 12, 2021, in the speech, \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2021 (fast side: these 178 Foxcon jobs were below the minimum required for the company to immediately claim tax exemptions from the State in the first year. Foxcon can still make up for these jobs at a later date and receive funds, which are among the first $4 billion in promised public subsidies.) Therefore, Foxcon is associated with more than 1,000 jobs, but reaching this figure requires a combination of the company's employment and the temporary construction work generated by the construction process. Building account is cumulative and there are no 1,000 current jobs. Foxcon said that the 854 construction jobs account is a cumulative calculation of every Wisconsin worker who has been involved in the project since its inception. It is the most recent job report compiled by Gilpin Construction, the general contractor for the project, and includes work done up to the end of November 2018. There were also several dozen construction workers outside Wisconsin. However, most of these construction jobs have ceased to exist since the end of the construction phase in which these workers participated. John Milkie, president of the construction company and co-contractors in Wisconsin, said a project the size of Foxcon is likely to have several hundred workers at the site at the same time. Milky and Pat O'Brien, Executive Director of Regional Development Group Miloki 7, said that 854 construction jobs seemed reasonable for a Vauxcon-sized project. Voss and Fitzgerald said in their statement that Foxcon had \"a positive effect all over Wisconsin with more than 1,000 new jobs.\" This means that 1,000 people are now working because of Foxcon, but that's not the case. Almost all of these posts are construction-related temporary posts. Experts say that it is likely that several hundred construction workers have been working at any point so far. This discrepancy is particularly noteworthy because the number of Foxcon posts is a key aspect of the political debate, and the recruitment in Foxcon itself did not amount to 260 jobs required to qualify for the first round of government tax exemptions. This makes it a statement with an element of truth that ignores critical facts that give a different impression. This is our definition of what is often wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01030"}
