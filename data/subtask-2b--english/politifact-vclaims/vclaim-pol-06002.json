One of the agreement\u2019s fundamental flaws, he said, is it allows Iran to continue to enrich uranium.\n\"When they allow Iran to continue with enrichment, they are breaking one of the key requirements with respect to the nonproliferation treaty where enrichment has been limited to basically the weapons states,\" Cheney said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Sept. 2, 2015. \"And here we are sanctioning giving enrichment capability to the Iranians.\"\nGiven that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT, was designed in part to allow countries to pursue the peaceful use of atomic energy, Cheney\u2019s claim struck us as dubious.\nRatified by the United States in 1969, the treaty\u2019s first two articles target the spread of nuclear weapons. Nations that already have nukes promise not to help other countries acquire them, and those without nukes promise not to try and get them.\nThe fourth article lays down the ground rules for a peaceful nuclear program:\nNothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with articles I and II of this Treaty.\nNational representatives to a United Nations conference in 2000 to assess the treaty added a bit more detail about the peaceful use of nuclear energy in their final report:\nThe Conference confirms that each country\u2019s choices and decisions in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be respected without jeopardizing its policies or international cooperation agreements and arrangements for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and its fuel-cycle policies.\nEnriching uranium, as this diagram shows, is part of the nuclear fuel cycle.\n\nSource: International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaryl Kimball is executive director of the Arms Control Association, an organization that favors the current deal. Kimball refutes Cheney\u2019s statement.\n\"Former Vice President Cheney is incorrect in asserting that the NPT prohibits enrichment by non-nuclear weapon states,\" Kimball said. \"Article IV of the treaty does not \u2018allow it,\u2019 nor does it prohibit it.\u2019 \"\nBrian Finlay, managing director of the Stimson Center, a defense policy group in Washington, also finds Cheney\u2019s words problematic.\n\"He is correct to say that France, the United States, Russia, China and the United Kingdom all have enrichment capacities,\" Finlay said. \"But so do Germany, Japan, the Netherlands -- definitely not nuclear weapons states.\"\nFinlay noted that there is debate over whether Article IV grants Iran the right to enrich uranium. Some\u00a0diplomats argue it only specifically grants a right to pursue peaceful uses. Whether that includes enrichment is left vague. However, under no reading does the treaty limit enrichment to nuclear-armed states. Finlay said unambiguously, \"Cheney misspoke.\"\nWe note that Cheney is correct that the deal with Iran allows it to continue to enrich uranium. In Annex 1 of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, one section specifically addresses enrichment.\nThe first clause states that \"Iran will keep its enrichment capacity at no more than 5060 IR-1 centrifuge machines in no more than 30 cascades in their current configurations in currently operating units at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant for 10 years.\"\nThe next clause commits Iran to a maximum level of enrichment of 3.67 percent for 15 years. There are many more details, but the point is that Iran gets to run a system to enrich uranium.\nFor the curious, bomb-grade uranium needs to be enriched to about the 90 percent point. However, as we\u2019ve reported before, once uranium-235 is enriched to about the 4-5 percent level, that\u2019s about two-thirds of the work needed to get it to 90 percent. You need about 25 kilograms of that highly enriched material to make one bomb.\nSupporters of the deal say there are enough inspections and safeguards in place to make sure that Iran doesn\u2019t cheat. Critics obviously think otherwise.\nOur ruling\nCheney said that a key piece of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is that only nuclear-armed states can have enrichment programs. The text of the treaty and subsequent international conferences say otherwise. While it\u2019s debatable whether the treaty grants nations the right to enrich, if a non-nuclear nation wants to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, the treaty doesn\u2019t stand in the way.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06002"}
