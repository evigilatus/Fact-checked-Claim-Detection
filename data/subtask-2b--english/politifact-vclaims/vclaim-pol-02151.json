Randy Bryce says his", "text": "A first-time-ever claim will almost always get our attention.\nOne was made by Randy Bryce, a Democrat who is running for the southern Wisconsin U.S. House seat being vacated by Republican Paul Ryan, the House speaker.\nBryce, a union ironworker, was interviewed by CNN talk show host Don Lemon on March 14, 2018. Asked about the surprise win that night by Democrat Conor Lamb in a special House election in Pennsylvania, Bryce said:\nWell, he ran a very pro-union campaign. Being a union member, that\u2019s something that\u2019s been very important for me, standing up for working people. I mean, our campaign staff was the first to unionize in the history of politics. So, that\u2019s something I\u2019m very proud of.\nFirst ever?\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBryce's evidence\nBryce\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, noting it\u2019s hard to prove something has never occurred before, told us she was not aware of any previous campaign staffs that unionized before Bryce\u2019s campaign workers joined the Campaign Workers Guild and forged a contract with Bryce in December 2017. The deal was announced three months later.\nThe union itself is new, having started organizing in early 2017. So we sought out experts in labor history.\nAsking the experts\nOf the 12 labor history experts we contacted (see the list of sources accompanying this article), none said they were aware of any previous campaign staffs that had been unionized.\nBut none could say for sure that it had never happened.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore fact checks on unions:\nScott Walker: Did FDR oppose collective bargaining for government workers?\nAlberta Darling: Wisconsin lawmaker voted to allow using tax money to pay for Viagra for public school employees?\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nHere are some of their responses:\nI suspect there have been staff who joined unions, but he (Bryce) may be the first to recognize and bargain with them. \u00a0I don\u2019t know of anyone who\u2019s studied this question. -- University of Minnesota history professor William Jones\nI think we can say it\u2019s true for contemporary politics. I am not going to vouch for anything prior to the National Labor Relations Act (signed in 1935) because I\u2019m not sure we would know. -- Kate Bronfenbrenner, labor education research director at Cornell University\nI don\u2019t know for sure, but it seems unlikely that in 200+ years no one did this before. -- Ruth Milkman, sociologist of labor and labor movements at City University of New York Graduate Center\nI don\u2019t know of any, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist. There is no central database for local unions, and many do not affiliate with a national union. Campaign staffs could have been unionized and we would never know. -- Rutgers University labor studies professor Dorothy Sue Cobble\nWe also checked with the National Labor Relations Board, which also does not keep such records.\nThe Office and Professional Employees International Union wasn\u2019t able to help us and we didn\u2019t hear back from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO).\nOur rating\nBryce says: \"Our campaign staff was the first to unionize in the history of politics.\"\nThe dozen experts we consulted said they were not aware of any previous campaign staff unionizing, though they could not state flatly that it had never occurred.\nIf new information surfaces, we\u2019ll reconsider this rating.
