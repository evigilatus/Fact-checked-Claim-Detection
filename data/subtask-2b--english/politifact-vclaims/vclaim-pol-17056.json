Specifically, we see a direct correlation to the start of the statewide mask requirement at the end of June. Two to three weeks after implementing this requirement, we started to see the beginning of these more stable trends.\"\nIs it true that there\u2019s a \"direct correlation\" between North Carolina\u2019s mask requirement and COVID-19 stabilization?\nData shows that the number of new reported COVID-19 cases is beginning to stabilize. Experts told PolitiFact the mask law and case count could be related, but that it\u2019s hard to quantify the law\u2019s impact.\nCases leveling\nGov. Roy Cooper announced the mask requirement on June 24 and it went into effect on June 26.\nCohen said North Carolina\u2019s case count started to level about three weeks later. Why is Cohen judging the rule\u2019s effectiveness three weeks after its implementation, rather than immediately after its implementation?\nIt can take up to 14 days between the time someone was infected and the time they start showing symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means someone could have contracted the virus before the mask mandate, but not shown symptoms or tested positive until after the mask requirement was in effect.\nSo let\u2019s look at North Carolina\u2019s case counts.\n\nOne way experts measure coronavirus trends is by calculating the 7-day rolling average for the number of new cases or deaths per day. The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and WRAL both track this metric.\nThe average number of new cases per day rose until about July 18, when DHHS reported 2,481 cases. The daily count started to drop after that date, and the rolling 7-day average has been less than 2,000 cases ever since.\nWhat experts said\nSo Cohen is right that the number of new cases is stabilizing. Is that a direct result of the mandate?\nThere\u2019s evidence that widespread mask-wearing has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, as we\u2019ve previously reported.\u00a0\nWe spoke with experts at the University of North Carolina, Harvard University, the University of Nebraska and the University of Toronto.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile they agreed that there may be a correlation, they say there\u2019s not enough evidence yet to determine how much influence the mask rule had on the stabilization.\nOther factors -- such as social distancing or testing availability -- could also play a role.\nBut reviewing that data typically takes months, said Ryan McNamara, a research associate in UNC\u2019s Department of Microbiology and Immunology.\u00a0\n\"There's just a lot of variables at play that need to be accounted for,\" he said.\nThere\u2019s a popular saying in research: \"correlation does not mean causation.\" In this context, it means that the mask law may not have caused the dip in new COVID-19 cases, even though there are signs a cause-and-effect relationship could exist.\n\"That said, Dr. Cohen and her team are in possession of much more data than I am. I think her statement was carefully worded and has scientific merit.\"\nAli Khan, dean of the College of Public Health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, agreed that it\u2019s premature to directly credit the mask rule for the leveling-off of cases.\u00a0\nBut he believes Cohen\u2019s claim is fair, given that \"other data that (shows) masks work and accounting for numerous caveats such as what else happened 2-3 weeks ago.\"\nDr. Barry Bloom, a research professor of public health at Harvard University, said it\u2019s \"difficult to disaggregate a single intervention from the other standard public health behaviors.\"\nHowever, Bloom said it\u2019s possible that the mask requirement not only prompted more people to wear masks -- but to start taking other precautionary measures as well.\n\"I think it is safe to say they may have contributed to the more stable trends, assuming the trends are indeed stable for a couple of weeks,\" Bloom said.\u00a0\nAs of August 3, the state\u2019s rolling 7-day average remained below 2,000 cases and was still declining.\nOur ruling\nCohen said there\u2019s a \"direct correlation\" between North Carolina\u2019s mask requirement and COVID-19 stabilization.\nBased on the data available in late July, experts said there does appear to be a correlation, but it\u2019s too early to draw conclusions about it. Verifying the strength of the correlation can take months.\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17056"}
