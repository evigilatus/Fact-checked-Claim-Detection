Amy Klobochar's claim is close.", "text": "In CNN City Hall in New Hampshire, United States of America, Amy Klobochar of Minnesota, one of the Democratic presidential candidates in 2020, one of the attendees asked her: \"Why can't we get medical care for everyone?\" This proposal would establish a single, universal national health insurance programme. Without a specific commitment to medical care for all, Klobochar, who is seen as running to political status, said, \"I think we must reach universal health care in this country.\" A few minutes later, I made a statistical allegation that we wanted to verify. \"But the other part of the equation is doing something about prescription drugs,\" said Klobochar. == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man We wanted to know whether its estimate of the share of prescription drugs in health spending is accurate. The Klobochar campaign refers to a recent assessment by the federal government, which uses personal health expenditures, and by the Research Centre, which uses total health expenditures. There are differences in data. (Personal expenditure, for example, does not explain expenditure on management or construction. But almost both measures work for her. \u2022 16.7 per cent: this estimate by the United States Department of Health and Human Services was for expenditure on personal health expenditures on prescription drugs in 2015. 2018 is estimated at 16.8 per cent. By the way, approximately three quarters of the estimated $457 billion spent on prescription drugs was at retail outlets such as store pharmacies. The remainder relates to non-retailed drugs - those provided by medical providers, as is the case in the hospital or in the doctor &apos; s office. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021, we found that the same figure of 16.7 per cent corresponds to the current estimate of the amount spent on retail trade and non-retail drugs as a percentage of personal health expenditure. This estimate comes from a May 2018 report on Altarum, a non-profit research group based in Ann Arbor, Mitch. (The same report says that medicines prescribed by the doctor amount to 14.2 per cent of total health expenditure, but the letter told us that the figure is 16.7 per cent when considering only personal health expenditures.) \u2022 15%: For total health care expenditure for 2016, this estimate was carried out by the Centre for Health Policy and Results at the Sloan Kettering Cancer Memorial Center in New York. It was published in July 2018. As in the case of the federal estimate, this estimate calculates expenditure on retail trade and non-retail drugs; but it varies in that it calculates the revenue collected not only for drug manufacturers, but also for intermediaries such as distributors. We have warned that the screening of economic figures, Gail Whelinski, a senior colleague at the Hope Health Project, is that estimates of the amount spent on medicines prescribed by the hospital are more difficult than the production of prescription drugs. But Klobochar specifically included hospital medical expenses in its claim. Two other health-care experts, Cynthia Cox, Kaiser Family Foundation, and Catherine Baker, Dean of the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, told us that estimates involving hospital medicines are reliable and that the measurement of expenditure on prescription drugs against personal health expenditures is strong. \"Almost 20 percent of our health-care costs are now when you have prescription drugs in the hospital.\" The best estimates we have found indicate that the proportion of spending on prescription drugs ranges from 15 per cent, when considering total health-care expenditure, to 17 per cent, when considering spending on personal health care only. We're mostly assessing her statement right.
