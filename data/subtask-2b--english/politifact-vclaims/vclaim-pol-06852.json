We tuned in for the pre-show, with a beverage in one hand and our phone in the other. Our only care was coming up with snarky tweets about the rich and famous. \u00a0\nThen Today host Matt Lauer had to go and kill our vibe with an apparently researched question for Kevin Spacey, who plays the conniving House Majority Whip Frank Underwood on Netflix\u2019s House of Cards.\n\"You know, we were sitting together at breakfast, and we saw a fact,\" Lauer said, ticking us off because now we had to put our beverage down and give him our full attention. \"Do you know that the name Frank has risen in popularity by 20 percent since this show debuted? What does that say about parents across America?\"\n\"Well,\" Spacey said, \"if the parents also have last names that start with a \u2018u,\u2019 then, F.U. as initials has risen dramatically as well.\"\n\"We are live, Kevin,\" Lauer said, fearing an expletive. \"Where\u2019s that seven-second delay when you need it?\" joked co-host Savannah Guthrie.\nSpacey went on to have a pretty great night, winning his first Globe for Best Actor in a TV Series (Drama) for his role as Underwood.\nWe still had work to do. We wanted to know if Lauer was for real about the name Frank taking a leap into popularity since the world was introduced to House of Cards (the third season premieres Feb. 27, 2015).\nWhat the numbers say\nWe turned first to a super glamorous source: the Social Security Administration.\nThe agency, which maintains a list of baby names going back to 1880, receives information on names from parents when they apply for a child\u2019s Social Security number at his or her birth.\nFrank, a form of Francis as you would know from watching the show, used to be a really big name near the turn of the 20th century. From 1880 to 1892, it was the sixth-most popular name of U.S. males. It remained in the top 10 of baby names for boys until 1923, the year it started its long, slow slide to the 327th spot in 2013.\nThe chart shows Frank was never more unpopular than in 2013, the same year subscription-based Netflix released the first season of House of Cards (Feb. 1, 2013, to be exact). The greater the ranking number, the lower the popularity of the name.\nRanking of the male name Frank \n\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n327\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n319\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n308\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n302\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n291\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n278\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\n262\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n246\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\n\n231\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\n\n230\n\n\n\n\n2003\n\n\n230\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2002\n\n\n216\n\n\n\n\n2001\n\n\n213\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\n\n208\n\n\n\n\n1999\n\n\n187\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Social Security Administration\nSo Frank had become pretty unpopular before House of Cards started running. And now?\nThis is where we have to introduce a major plot twist to this fact-check: The Social Security Administration has not yet released its 2014 data. The agency releases that information on the Friday before Mother\u2019s Day in May.\nWithout the last year\u2019s data, we can\u2019t discern if there was a possible increase -- much less what really drove it.\nWe do, however, have an idea of what Lauer is talking about. BabyCenter.com, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is a popular pregnancy and parenting website that releases an annual Baby Names Survey and Top 100 Names list. The names list is based on 406,000 babies born in 2014 to mothers who are registered BabyCenter users.\nBabyCenter global editor in chief Linda Murray hailed 2014 as the \"year of the binge-watching baby name\" because of the influence of TV shows that about 20 percent of surveyed moms said had on their baby name choice.\nThe press release doesn\u2019t just single out Frank, which saw a 19-percent increase from the 352nd ranking to No. 297 among BabyCenter users, but also House of Cards characters Claire (Frank\u2019s wife, up 14 percent), journalist Zoe (up 13 percent), and lobbyist Remy (up 11 percent).\nAnother Netflix show, Orange is the New Black, inspired a rash of baby-naming after characters from its female-centric cast, including Galina (up 67 percent), Nicky (up 35 percent), Piper (up 28 percent) and\u00a0Dayanara (up 19 percent), BabyCenter says.\nTo be clear, these increases are just the percentage that the names moved up the list from the year before. The BabyCenter survey doesn\u2019t include information on how many people named their children Frank (or any other name) year by year.\nThe naming effect is similar for characters in the Shonda Rhimes-produced shows Scandal (Olivia), Grey\u2019s Anatomy (Meredith)\u00a0and How To Get Away with Murder (Annalise), BabyCenter said, as well as the movie Frozen and its star Elsa.\nMurray called the correlation between trending baby names and binge-worthy shows \"undeniable.\"\nOther experts weigh in\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we should take the word of BabyCenter as gold. Some of its user-generated \u00a0information mirrors federal name data, but there are discrepancies. BabyCenter\u2019s most popular male name in 2013 was Jackson, and the federal winner was Noah. Sophia remained the most popular girl name according to both sources.\nFor instance, the popularity of the name Frank varied pretty significantly when you compared BabyCenter and Social Security information from years past. (We looked so you didn\u2019t have to.)\nBasically, experts say we need to wait for the Social Security Administration list to know for sure.\nIt isn\u2019t inconceivable that Frank or Francis is turning a corner after the popularity of House of Cards, said Laura Wattenberg, author of Baby Name Wizard and the website of the name. But it may also have to do with parents who want to honor Pope Francis (but don\u2019t want to call their children Francis).\n\"It\u2019s hard for one use to really move the needle,\" Wattenberg said. \"Frank has been so unpopular for so long that you could get what looks like a really big jump just from a couple dozen names.\"\nEchoing Social Security\u2019s 2013 press release about hot baby names, Wattenberg said the reality is that \"obscure\" Spanish TV shows are more likely to have the hottest name of the year than a Netflix hit. In 2013, the girl\u2019s name Daleyza, the name of a young woman\u2019s character on the Spanish-language show Larrymania, increased in popularity by more than 3,000 places. \nWho would do this\nThen we got curious about the name Frank itself. As Lauer prodded, what does naming a child after the murderous, conniving character say about American parents?\nParents are \"desperate for fresh name ideas\" these days, and are not choosy about the source, Wattenberg said. Gone are the days when all-American parents name their offspring in tribute to the new president. \"They just want something that sounds fresh and creative,\" she said. \"That includes villains, video game characters.\"\nAlbert Mehrabian, professor emeritus of psychology at UCLA, wrote the books The Name Game and Baby Name Report Card based on his studies of the attractiveness of names.\nHis studies aimed to capture the impressions left by names isolated from any other factor, such as appearance or personality. Participants in his studies were asked to imagine themselves meeting someone for the first time knowing just their first name, its spelling and the person\u2019s gender. The participants gave numerical scores on a range of adjectives describing the name, and their responses were averaged and categorized into four areas that defined the name\u2019s attractiveness -- ethical/caring, popular/fun, success and femininity/masculinity.\nThe name Frank scored a 65 of 100 overall, doing really well in terms of giving a successful, ambitious impression but lacking substantially in ethics, Mehrabian said. (Sounds a lot like Spacey\u2019s character, don\u2019t you think?)\nThe given name Francis, meanwhile, scores higher at 78 overall. The increase comes from the stronger impression of ethics and compassion for people named Francis, a score of 99 versus 22 for Frank.\n\"So Frank, I would say, it\u2019s a so-so name,\" Mehrabian said. \"But it does have high implications of success.\"\nA spokeswoman for Lauer\u2019s Today show did not get back to us.\nOur ruling\nLauer asked Spacey if he knew that \"the name Frank has risen in popularity by 20 percent\" since the debut of House of Cards in 2013.\nLauer seems to be referencing a 2014 press release from the website BabyCenter.com that played up the influence of Netflix shows on new children\u2019s names.\nIt should be obvious that the company\u2019s priority is generating publicity and not sound scientific methods. Experts say the best data comes from the Social Security Administration, which will not release its baby name rankings until May 2015.\nAnd we do know that, according to\u00a0Social Security data, Frank was never more unpopular than in 2013, when\u00a0House of Cards\u00a0debuted.\nNow you know more than you probably need to about baby name trends, and how a fact-checker\u2019s mind works while trying to watch mindless television.\nThe claim is Mostly False.\n\nHelp fund PolitiFact\u2019s Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06852"}
