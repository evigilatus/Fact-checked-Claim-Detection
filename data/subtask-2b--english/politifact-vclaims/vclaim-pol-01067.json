Together with aid from local government and utility ratepayers, the total incentives are worth about $4 billion, in exchange for the manufacturing facility and up to 13,000 jobs.\nReaction in Wisconsin to the news Foxconn was considering changing its plans was swift.\nIn a Jan. 30, 2019, joint statement, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, blamed Democratic Gov. Tony Evers for the changes, saying his administration brought with it a \"wave of economic uncertainty.\" We rated that Pants on Fire.\nA separate part of their statement provided another claim we want to check:\n\"From the very beginning, we looked out for the best interest of the taxpayers of the state,\" the statement read. \"Not a dollar would be paid out until jobs in the Foxconn development area were created. The incentive package is based on fulfilling the contract.\"\nAre the GOP lawmakers correct that \"not a dollar would be paid out until jobs in the Foxconn development area are created?\"\nThe evidence\nWhen asked for backup, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer offered this statement via email:\n\"This part of the statement directly refers to the state incentives that were agreed to in the contract with Foxconn in the EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit) zone. No state tax dollars are awarded with sales tax break. And the bench marks that were set for the incentive plan that Democrats criticize were not met as outlined in the letter to WEDC (Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation).\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also noted that Foxconn fell short of its job goals for 2018 and, thus, did not get the related state money.\nLet\u2019s break it down.\nJob-related incentives: In January 2019, Foxconn reported 178 full-time Wisconsin employees in 2018 as of Dec. 31, 2018 \u2014 82 jobs short of the minimum required for the company to immediately claim state job-creation tax credits.\nFoxconn, however, can still earn credits for the 2018 employment by making up for the job-creation shortfall in future years of its long-term contract with the state.\nSales tax break: Unlike the job-related incentives, Foxconn is already benefiting from state-granted sales tax break of up to $150 million. According to a 2017 Legislative Fiscal Bureau report, the Department of Revenue estimates that the sales and use tax exemption will result in tax savings of $139 million for Foxconn and its contractors.\nIt does amount to money for Foxconn, but it is fuzzier. As the Fiscal Bureau report notes, in part: \"Since it is highly unlikely that Foxconn would locate in the state without the incentives provided under the Act, this amount should not be viewed as a state revenue loss.\"\nLocal incentives: In the statement, Vos and Fitzgerald framed their claim around state-based incentives. But that ignores another significant piece -- support provided by local units of government.\nThe Village of Mount Pleasant and Racine County have borrowed $355 million so far in support of Foxconn. The local governments have spent about $190 million of that, with most of the money going for land acquisition.\nSo, looking at all three, the \"not a dollar\" claim from Vos and Fitzgerald is a mixed bag.\nIf you look strictly at the job-related incentives, the two are on solid ground. But their original statement refers broadly to state tax dollars. The company is already saving dollars through the construction sales tax break, even if it\u2019s not considered a state revenue loss.\nFinally, while money borrowed at the local level may not strictly count as state incentives, it does amount to a substantial public investment in the project. And that money is already being spent -- a fact the claim glosses over.\nOur rating\nVos and Fitzgerald said \"not a dollar\" in state taxpayer money will be paid out \"until jobs in the Foxconn development area were created.\"\nWhile job-creation incentives have not kicked in, that only represents a portion of the state-level support -- and the company is already benefiting from the sales tax break on construction materials. In addition, the statement ignores costs to local taxpayers -- ones the company is also benefiting from already.\nOn balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01067"}
