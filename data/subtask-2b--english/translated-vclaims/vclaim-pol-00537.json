Well, maybe you can if it's the federal government's advantage -- and that's a problem that says Congressman Florida. The U.S. Republicans say that tax dollars are wasted on the benefits of dead people. In a press release issued on 28 May, Studio says: \"It is estimated that in 2018 alone, the dead received $1 billion in medical benefits, medical aid, social security payments and federal pensions.\" Steub has introduced legislation requiring federal agencies and departments to verify the eligibility of individuals who have reached the age of 105 or older for benefits. Steub is right that the federal government spends a lot of money on benefits to people without checking their information against death data, but his statement requires some warning. It shows that $1 billion in incorrect payments is payments made by the Government to the wrong person, the wrong amount, or for the wrong reason. Incorrect payments include fraud and misuse, errors and cases where payment lacks the required documentation. (Not every inappropriate amount is an excess) In 2018, improper payments amounted to some $151 billion. Since 2003, improper payments have increased to $1.5 trillion. Steub is beeping on one type of incorrect batch, which the government calls \"failure to verify death data.\" There are various reasons for improper payments. Through research into the 2018 data set in the accuracy of payment.gov, we found that incorrect payments for \"failure to verify death data\" increased to about $966 million before any effort to recover those dollars. The largest portion of improper payments related to social security - about $796 million. The rest was Medicaid, retirement and disability. Information on medical care has not yet been reported.) Within just a few decades, social security, medical care, medical aid, other mandatory spending programmes, and the payment of interest on debt will obscure our entire budget. Through Charles Pope on February 3, 2012, one of the main warnings about Stubby's statement about dead persons receiving health-care benefits: payments are made for medical care and aid to health-care providers - not beneficiaries. Joseph R. Antos, an expert in health care and retirement policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said: Steve Ellis, Deputy Chief Taxpayer for the general sense, said the category \"failure to verify death data\" was failure to verify whether people were dead, not necessarily all of them dead. Social security receives information on deaths from multiple sources, including family members, banks and other government agencies. The \"main death file\" has 90 million records, but even then it states that it is not inclusive of all deaths. The system is not complete -- sometimes the Department of Social Security announced a premature death. Not all federal agencies have the same access to death data, a problem that some legislators want to correct. While the figure of $1 billion mentioned by Stiobi is significant, it is a small part of the total payments, as Elise said. For example, the rate of improper social security payments in 2018 was 0.7 per cent of total payments. The federal government certainly can and should do better, Ellis said. But the situation is not fixed because it does not give enough money to lead us to a cry to change it. The responsible Federal Budget Committee in 2016 found that if social security were to be able to eliminate all improper payments, it would reduce costs by at most 6 per cent. \"It is estimated that in 2018 alone, the dead received $1 billion in medical benefits, medical aid, social security payments and federal pensions.\" 2018 data showed about $966 million in incorrect payments for \"failure to verify death data.\" Most of these incorrect payments were for social security. Nor do beneficiaries receive direct benefits for medical care or assistance - those going to service providers. We're mostly assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00537"}
