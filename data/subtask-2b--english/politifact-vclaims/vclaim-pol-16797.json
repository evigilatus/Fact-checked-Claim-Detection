The words, \"I can do all things..\" are written on the side of the sneakers. That\u2019s the beginning of the Phillipians 4:13 Bible verse, \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\"\u00a0\nText below the photo reads:\n\"Steph Curry had to make a decision to either stop writing scripture in his shoe before every game while wearing Nikes, or wear a sneaker made by a company who would support his vision. Steph Curry decided that his faith was more important that (sic) the fortune he earned from Nike, so he cancelled his deal with Nike and now wears Under Armor sneakers and they print the scripture in his shoes for him. As a believer never compromise your faith to make any deal, any situation ir (sic) relationship work.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIt is accurate that Curry writes a variation of Phillipians 4:13 on his shoes \u2013\u2013 he has since his college days \u2013\u2013 but there is no evidence to support the claim that his Nike endorsement deal fell through because the company wouldn\u2019t allow him to write scripture on his shoes. There have been no statements from Curry, Nike or Under Armour that say religion was a factor in any dealmaking.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to ESPN, Nike and Curry split in 2013 after Under Armour offered Curry, a young basketball player who soon emerged as one of the best in the league, more money than Nike.\nCurry said he started writing Phillippians 4:13 on his shoes for encouragement while he was playing at Davidson College. He has written a variation of it on his sneakers ever since.\nIn the 2013 offseason, Curry and his father, Dell Curry, attended a pitch meeting to extend the Nike contract.\u00a0\nBut in the meeting, the elder Curry told ESPN it was clear from the start that the company didn\u2019t consider his son a top-tier athlete. Among other missteps, Dell Curry said a Nike official mispronounced Steph\u2019s first name Stephen (which is pronounced traditionally) as \"Steph-on,\" and one powerpoint slide featured Kevin Durant\u2019s name instead. ESPN reported that Dell Curry said he stopped paying attention after that, and while they sat through the entirety of the pitch, \"the decision to leave Nike was in the works\" Writes ESPN:\n\"In the meeting, according to Dell, there was never a strong indication that Steph would become a signature athlete with Nike. \u2018They have certain tiers of athletes,\u2019 Dell says. \u2018They have Kobe, LeBron and Durant, who were their three main guys. If he signed back with them, we're on that second tier.\u2019\"\nCurry went on to sign a $4-million-a year deal with Under Armour that Nike failed to match. In 2015, the partnership was extended through 2024.\nIt\u2019s true that Curry writes his favorite Bible verse on his shoes, but there is no indication Nike barred him from writing the verse or that any such conflict over Curry writing Bible verses inspired Curry to leave the company and join Under Armour.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16797"}
