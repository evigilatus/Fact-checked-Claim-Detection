So we have to fix it.\" Medical care, which provides health care to some 50 million elderly or disabled Americans, is financed through a range of funding sources: medical care salary tax; public revenue (mostly from federal income taxes); premiums paid by medical care users; and a tax on social security benefits and State payments for medically prescribed medicines subsidy. We're gonna get a little deeper into the weed. The programme is financed from two separate trust fund accounts: the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. Medical care salary taxes go to the Health Care Trust Fund, which is mainly used to pay for boarding costs (also known as part A of medical care). The SMI Trust Fund is used to pay for doctor visits, outpatient care and medically prescribed medication benefits (section B and section D of Medicare). The SMI Trust Fund is funded primarily (about 75 per cent) from public revenue, with the rest coming mostly from patient premiums. Let's start with the first half of the Paoliente statement, that \"just about 50%\" of medical care is paid either from premiums or taxes. According to the 2011 annual report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Health Insurance Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust, medical care expenditure amounted to $523 billion in 2010. \u2022 Interest tax, $13.8 billion; general revenue, $205 billion Okay, but what about the second half of the statement, that the rest of the medical care expenses came from \"spending deficit... or spending debt.\" Lisa Butts of the Washington Advisory Group on Health Policy Alternatives, co-author of a 22-page book entitled \"Chief in Medical Care Funding\" in July 2009, said that the description of public revenue as \"deficit in spending\" was misleading. Yeah, she said, the government is spending more than it's taking in. But not all government spending is spending on disability. In order to be accurate, you have to assume only that the portion of the budget deficit is used for medical care. Using Paulette's logic, she said, instead you can put medical care funding first and then say all defense spending is spending deficit. Botitz also believes that the Paoliente commentary is misleading because since its inception in 1965, the Medical Care Programme has been established to be partly financed by public revenue. \"His comment indicates that these items (taxes and salary premiums) are supposed to pay for the program and that they are not functioning,\" said Butez. \"It was never supposed to be fully financed through taxes and salary premiums. It is somewhat misleading to suggest that something has happened.\" In fact, for years, the Trust Fund has achieved a surplus and has been used to finance other parts of the federal budget. To the extent that the \"bank\" considered the money, there was a balance of about $344 billion last year. However, in recent years, the cost of treatment in hospitals and nursing homes has exceeded the amount of salary taxes (a problem that is expected to worsen in the coming years as more prosperous children reach retirement age). As a result, HI's surplus has been \"minus\" and is expected to be exhausted within several years. At that point, the gap between taxes on salaries and the actual cost of hospital treatment must be captured by taxpayers. The SMI Trust Fund - again, the fund used to pay for doctor visits and prescription drugs - was established so that part of it is paid through patient premiums, but the bulk of it is paid out of public revenue. Last year, the Government paid $205 billion in public revenue to the Fund. Butts said that the cost projections for that programme were alarming, but the funding of the programme was intended primarily from public revenue. Marilyn Moon, Medical Care Expert at the American Research Institutes, an independent policy group, said that the shift from hospital care to outpatient care and doctor services had put pressure on the Short Care Fund, as had the entitlement to medicines added in 2006. But it's misleading to call it general revenue put in the box \"spending deficit,\" she said. We have asked the spokesman for Paulinte Alex Conant for some support for the Paolinte statement, especially since the amount not covered by taxes and salary premiums comes from spending on disability. Conant directed us to two sources. The first was on December 1, 2010, the NPR interview with Douglas Holtz-Ekin, former head of the Budget Office of Congress (and former Senior Economic Policy Adviser of the 2008 United States presidential campaign, Sun John McCain), who said: \"If you look beyond the next eight to ten years, medical care is the problem of disability. There is simply no way that we can address our financial problems without reaching agreement with the future of medical care.\" Konant also referred to this warning from the 2011 annual report of the Board of Medical Care Trustees: \"The withdrawal of social security reserves, the Trust Fund for Human Health and public revenue transfers to the Ministry of Public Health will increase the pressure on the federal budget. Indeed, the pressure is already clear. For the sixth consecutive year, a \"warning on financing medical care\" is being launched, indicating that unearmarked sources of income - primarily public revenue - will soon account for more than 45 per cent of medical care expenditures. That threshold was actually breached for the first time in fiscal year 2010. The cost of medical care is certainly increasing and public revenues - mainly from income taxes - bear an increasing share of the burden. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office concluded that the explosive cost of medical care and other benefit programmes such as the Medical Assistance Programme and the Social Security Programme had placed the federal budget on an \"unsustainable financial track.\" It can be said that adding medical care costs to a budget that already suffers from a deficit simply increases expenditure on disability. However, to the extent that medical care has always been complemented by public revenue, we believe it is slightly misleading to describe anything that is not paid by medical care taxes or patient premiums as an expenditure on disability. So we're doing the Paoletti statement half right. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13006"}
