That means we\u2019ll have to keep borrowing more from countries like China. And that means more of your tax dollars will go toward paying off the interest on all the loans we keep taking out. By the end of this decade, the interest we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion. Just the interest payments.\"\n\nWe thought we\u2019d check whether Obama was correct that \"by the end of this decade, the interest we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion.\"\n\nWe turned to figures published by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress\u2019 nonpartisan arbiter of fiscal statistics and projections. Specifically, we looked at CBO\u2019s analysis, published in March, of Obama\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal.\n\nIn that report, CBO offered two different projections for what the interest burden would be by the end of the decade. One of the projections looks at what would happen under Obama\u2019s proposal. The other projection is known as the \"baseline\" budget. The baseline budget estimates what needs to be spent to maintain current services. It includes the effects of inflation, and it assumes that current law will continue indefinitely.\n\nBaselines can be a useful measure, but they are not perfect. Adhering to current law requires the assumption that Congress will let a number of policies expire, including the Bush tax cuts, periodic adjustments to limit the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax and delays to scheduled Medicare reimbursement cuts to physicians. There\u2019s no certainty that Congress and the president will follow through with these phase-outs, given the political support for them, so the baseline budget likely underestimates the size of future deficits.\n\nDespite such imperfections, we thought that both scenarios were relevant for judging the president\u2019s statement, so we\u2019ll offer the figures for both. We\u2019ll also offer figures for both 2019 and 2020, since we couldn\u2019t come up with an answer to the question of what year constitutes the \"end of this decade.\"\n\nLet\u2019s look first at the president\u2019s budget proposal.\n\nCBO says that during 2019, net interest costs will reach $794 billion. By 2020, the number reaches $866 billion.\n\nNow, we\u2019ll look at the baseline budget.\n\nCBO says that during 2019, net interest costs will reach $710 billion. By 2020, the number reaches $762 billion.\n\nNone of these four estimates reaches $1 trillion. The closest number is off by 13 percent, and the lowest is off by 29 percent.\n\nMarc Goldwein, policy director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the president is not far off, especially given the high degree of uncertainty about what the law will be a decade from now.\n\nOther experts we spoke to said the White House had to stretch to reach the flashy $1 trillion figure.\n\nDaniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said that \"$710 billion or $762 billion is a lot of money, but it's not \u2018nearly $1 trillion.\u2019\"\n\nThe White House pointed us to a third possibility -- the interest burden in 2021. Why 2021? That\u2019s the final year of the decadelong \"budget window.\" CBO estimated interest in 2021 to be $931 billion -- closer to $1 trillion than any of our other numbers, and possibly enough to justify Obama\u2019s wording of \"nearly $1 trillion.\"\n\nStill, we think most listeners wouldn\u2019t immediately assume the president is talking about budget windows when he says \"by the end of this decade.\" Using the figures for 2019 or 2020 instead, Obama\u2019s numbers are off by anywhere from 13 percent to 29 percent. Obama\u2019s underlying point is still sound -- the United States will have hundreds of billions of dollars of debt on the books -- but we think the most obvious numbers fall short of \"nearly $1 trillion.\" On balance, we rate the statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
