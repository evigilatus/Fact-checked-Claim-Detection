They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"\nThat last phrase hardly counterbalanced the rest. Mexican officials took serious offense. The interior minister said the charge was absurd and prejudiced, and that it served only to generate controversy.\nThe Daily Show\u2019s Jon Stewart had a go at Trump with former President Bill Clinton on June 17, 2015.\nClinton: \"What he said about the Mexicans, which was \u2026\"\nStewart: \"Bizarre.\"\nClinton: \"Not only that, just wrong. Basically between 2010 and 2014, there was no net in-migration from Mexico. That surprise you all? \u00a0All we read about is the violence and the drug war. The truth is that the previous president built 140 tuition free universities. Two years ago, the Mexicans produced 113,000 engineers. We produced 120,000. They\u2019ve had very brisk growth, and except in the narco-centers, the crime rate, the murder rate has gone down. It\u2019s a very interesting country.\"\nThere\u2019s plenty of interesting statistics there, but we\u2019ll focus just on the one about zero net in-migration.\nWe asked the Clinton Foundation for the data behind that claim but didn\u2019t hear back. Still, we were able to reach experts who were able to walk us through the numbers.\nOne way to measure net migration (the number of new arrivals versus the number who leave) is the count of people living in America who were born in Mexico. The Census Bureau tracks this. We used two sets of numbers from the American Community Survey -- an estimate based on three years of surveys and an estimate based on just the year the survey took place.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nBorn in Mexico\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n3-year average estimate (1,000s)\n\n\n1-year estimate (1,000s)\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n11,604\n\n\n11,585\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n11,650\n\n\n11,563\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n11,700\n\n\n11,673\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n11,642\n\n\n11,711\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: American Community Survey\nWhile there\u2019s a little variation, both estimates show a drop from 2010 to 2013. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us that the Mexican-born figures are a valid indicator of the overall trend.\n\"This strongly implies zero net (migration),\" Camarota said.\nAnother researcher, Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute, echoed that point.\nWhat about 2014? That\u2019s the end point for Clinton\u2019s comparison, but finalized numbers aren\u2019t out yet.\nTo get a sense of what the numbers might say, Camarota dug into the raw monthly counts from the Current Population Survey. These figures are less reliable, but they too show a consistent decline for Mexicans living in the United States in each of the first quarters of 2012 through 2014. \u00a0(Camarota did find a rise in the first quarter of 2015, but that is outside Clinton\u2019s window.)\nWe should note that using a population count isn\u2019t a perfect yardstick. In theory, a higher death rate could drive the numbers down, but that\u2019s unlikely. First, it would be headline news if thousands of people started dying like that. Second, Rosenblum noted that Mexican immigrants tend to be in their prime working years and younger people are healthier.\nA more complete study of net migration from Mexico came out in 2012. The Pew Research Center reported back then that based on census data from both sides of the border, from 2005 to 2010, more people moved from America to Mexico than the reverse.\nThat study raised the possibility that the net migration rate wasn\u2019t just zero -- it might actually be negative. Rosenblum thinks that\u2019s probably still true because some factors behind the shift show no sign of letting up.\nIn short, Clinton is right on the general trend experts agree, though we don\u2019t yet have the numbers for 2014 to completely confirm his point.\nFour reasons for the decline\nDemographics is possibly the biggest driver of the change in migration. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990 and now stands at 2.2 children per woman. Rosenblum said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce.\n\"In the 1980s, there was a surge of teenagers,\" Rosenblum said. \"With the birth rate having been down for several decades, we\u2019re now seeing many fewer Mexicans entering the prime working age group.\"\nRosenblum said apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop of more than 50 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped over half a million people coming in from Mexico. Last year, it was about 230,000.\nNot all of those people were Mexican, but the numbers are in line with the picture Clinton paints.\nRosenblum also believes that more surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect.\n\"All that enforcement has begun to pay off,\" he said.\nOther drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was.\nPlus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left.\nOur ruling\nClinton said that between 2010 and 2014, there was zero net in-migration from Mexico. The census data to prove that is\u00a0not in for 2014, but the numbers up to 2013 support his point, as do very preliminary 2014 data.The population of people living in America but born in Mexico fell by about 40,000 since 2010. That\u2019s not a perfect measure, but the experts we reached said it is a strong indication of a prevailing trend.\nThe experts we reached said that other data, including a rapid decline in apprehensions at the border and changing demographics in Mexico add weight to the conclusion that Clinton was correct.\nWith a caveat for the missing year of survey information, we rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06284"}
