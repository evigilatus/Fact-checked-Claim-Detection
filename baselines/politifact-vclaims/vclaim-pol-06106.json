PolitiFact Georgia couldn\u2019t resist looking further.\nGeorgia\u2019s Red Carpet\nGeorgia has heavily incentivized the entertainment industry since 2008 to lure projects.\nProduction companies can earn a 20 percent income tax credit on in-state costs of projects worth at least $500,000. Another 10 percent credit is given for using a Georgia logo in production credits.\nOne unique element of the credit: if a production company doesn\u2019t need to use it against its Georgia tax liability, it can sell the credit to another Georgia company to help finance a project.\nThose breaks have become even more attractive as other states, such as North Carolina, have cut back on their incentives.\nThe result: a 553 percent increase in spending from 2008\u2019s tally of $260.4 million spent on production in Georgia, according to Stefanie Paupeck Harper, spokeswoman for the state Department of Economic Development.\nThe impact\nAs head of the Georgia Film, Music and Digital Entertainment Office, Lee Thomas is responsible for certifying what productions can claim the state\u2019s tax credit.\nBut the way the state estimates the overall impact of that direct spending predates her 19-year tenure.\nFor at least 30 years, the state economic development department has multiplied direct spending by 3.57 to estimate impact.\nIn economic terms, that is a multiplier, or how many times each dollar of direct spending cycles through direct spending.\nIn the film industry\u2019s case, that means the state calculates that every dollar of direct spending has generated total spending of $3.57 in Georgia.\nLooking back to 2008, the state used the multiplier to calculate the film industry\u2019s impact at $465 million. That is an astonishing 1,190 percent jump on impact.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas acknowledged that the state doesn\u2019t know what sorts of spending that multiplier originally counted, or why the 3.57 estimate was used.\nBut keeping the same multiplier allows to track progress over time, comparing apples to apples, she said.\nAnd it\u2019s clear the more productions mean more local spending on gear, costumes, heating and air conditioning on set and location fees.\n\"If they spend on a caterer, that goes into the 3.57,\" Thomas said. \"Another thing we look at is film tourism, which is very hard to quantify but we know that those visitors are a direct result of the industry filming here. We certainly know that Georgia has seen significant growth in this industry.\"\nEconomics 101\nBruce Seaman is sympathetic to the growth argument.\nBut as an economist at the Andrew Young School of Public Policy at Georgia State University, he knows the multiplier the state is using is way too high.\nThe common IMPLAN model gives the industry a 1.83 multiplier. Using the state\u2019s method, that would translate into a far lower impact of $3.1 billion.\nIt\u2019s significant, to be sure. But even that high number is likely overstated, because the state has not determined its capture rate.\nThat is, for every $1 million a production company pays a big star \u2013 or $100,000 spent on hotel rooms \u2013 how much is captured in Georgia before the money goes back to the celebrity\u2019s L.A. home or the hotel\u2019s out-of-state headquarters?\n\"I want to know what it means to say, \u2018that money was spent in the state,\u2019\" Seaman said.\nAnd, a more detailed analysis would also benefit the state\u2019s case of impact.\nThat\u2019s because the state doesn\u2019t capture the long-term money invested from the boom, such as the erection of the new Pinewood Studios facility in Fayette County (where \"Ant-Man\" was shot last year) and the redevelopment of a Midtown facility for a new film and television master's degree program at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD).\nIt also fails to account for how many of the 43 productions in Georgia today, including a popular \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" sequel, would have selected the state without its growing ability to handle production.\n\"The good news, really, is the tax credits are spurring an indigenous film industry taking shape in Georgia,\" Seaman said. \"It\u2019s incredibly complicated and you would have to look at all of the details on a project-by-project basis to seriously know what\u2019s going on.\"\n\"The irony is, without that study, you are clearly overstating the short-term impacts but we appear to be understating the longer-term impacts. We wouldn\u2019t know without more careful study.\"\nOur ruling\nThe booming film industry in Georgia generated $6 billion in economic impact in the state in the most recent fiscal year, according to the state department of economic development.\nThe calculation is based on formula the state has used for at least 30 years, multiplied against direct spending.\nThere is no dispute that direct spending on productions has mushroomed, but the state can\u2019t explain why it uses a multiplier that is almost double the standard economic model for that calculation.\nThe state\u2019s formula likely also fails to capture long-term spending and investment that have taken hold in Georgia.\nThere is accuracy in the claim, especially in the carefully tracked direct spending from film and TV production in the state. But it leaves out important information that could better prove, or disprove, the statement.\nWe rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06106"}
