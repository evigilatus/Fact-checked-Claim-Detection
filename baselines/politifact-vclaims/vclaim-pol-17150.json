They focus largely on a comment Biden made in response to a voter during a February campaign stop in South Carolina.\nBut the America First Action ad presents that remark out of context. And while some tax experts estimate that Biden\u2019s plan would mean higher taxes on average for all income groups, those increases would be relatively small for all but the biggest earners.\n\nThe 30-second version of the ad opens with a narrator saying, \"Sometimes, politicians accidentally tell the truth,\" before cutting to the clip of Biden from the South Carolina event.\u00a0\n\"Guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut,\" Biden says. The ad replays the clip later, in between additional narration.\n\"The New York Times says Biden\u2019s tax increases are more than double Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan. Even the Tax Policy Center admits taxes would increase \u2018on all income groups,\u2019\" the narrator says, before showing the clip a second time. \"Big tax increases, crushing our recovery.\"\nThe spot finishes with Biden saying, \"It could go higher.\"\nThe ad takes Biden out of context twice\nAmerica First Action\u2019s portrayal of Biden\u2019s comments in South Carolina gives the impression that Biden told a crowd that all Americans would have their tax rates raised on his watch.\nThat\u2019s not the case. When Biden said \"your taxes are going to be raised, not cut,\" he wasn\u2019t talking about his plan for all taxpayers. He was addressing one person at the February event.\u00a0\nThe person indicated that they had benefited from the Republican-led tax bill that became law under President Donald Trump.\nThe exchange took place after Biden said, \"By the way, how many of you did really well with that $1.9 trillion tax cut? Really good shape, right?\" The crowd mostly laughed or groaned, but one member of the audience caught Biden\u2019s attention off camera by signaling that they benefited.\u00a0\nAddressing that person directly, Biden said: \"Well, you did. Well, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re doing well already. But guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.\"\n\nThe full exchange shows that Biden was saying his plan would raise taxes for people who, in his words, \"benefited from\" the GOP\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. A Biden campaign official said his point was that the wealthy \u2014 not all Americans \u2014 would not benefit from his plan.\nThe ad\u2019s portrayal of the exchange leaves a different impression.\u00a0\nThe same could be said of the ad\u2019s second clip of Biden, in which he says, \"It could go higher.\"\u00a0\nThe ad doesn\u2019t specify what Biden was referring to when he made the remark. But the complete\u00a0December interview with CNBC shows that Biden was talking specifically about the top tax rate for capital gains, the profits earned from selling property or investments, which are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.\u00a0\n\"We should charge people the same tax for their capital gains as their tax rate is,\" Biden said. \"And I think we should raise the tax rate back to, for example, I take it back to where it was before it was reduced. It could go higher.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.

That\u2019s accurate, said Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center and co-author of the March analysis.\nThe Tax Policy Center estimated that Biden\u2019s proposals would raise revenues by 1.5% of gross domestic product over 10 years, Mermin said, citing what he said is the preferred metric for comparing across time. The group\u2019s analysis of the Clinton plan put that figure at 0.6% of GDP.\u00a0\nBut the America First Action ad was less exact in its claim that \"even the Tax Policy Center admits taxes would increase \u2018on all income groups.\u2019\" As FactCheck.org noted, that\u2019s a partial quote from the group\u2019s March report.\nThe full sentence from the report said: \"In 2021, the proposals would increase taxes on average on all income groups, but the highest-income households would see substantially larger increases, both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes.\"\nBiden has publicly vowed not to raise taxes for those making less than $400,000 per year. His plan aims to raise up to $4 trillion in tax revenues over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, in part by rolling back some of the GOP-led tax law\u2019s tax cuts for corporations and for people with taxable incomes over $400,000.\u00a0\nAmong Biden\u2019s proposed changes, he would:\n\n\nIncrease the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.\n\n\nRaise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6%.\n\n\nPlace a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000.\n\n\nTax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners.\n\n\nThe highest earners would bear the brunt of the new tax burden brought on by Biden\u2019s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center and other analyses of his proposals. The plan would lead to \"small, modest increases\" in costs for lower-income groups, Mermin said.\nBut as we\u2019ve reported, those changes would not be because of higher federal income tax rates across the board.\n\"Those small tax increases for the first four quintiles \u2014 and this is said in our brief \u2014 are almost all due to the indirect effects of the increase in the corporate tax rate,\" Mermin said, including lowered wages for workers.\u00a0\nOn average, the Tax Policy Center\u2019s March report predicted that the bottom 80% of earners could wind up paying between $30 and $590 extra annually on Biden\u2019s watch. It estimated that over 90% of the tax increases would be borne by the top 20% of earners.\n\"No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year,\" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis of Biden\u2019s plan.\nRELATED: Facebook post wrongly claims Biden would hike tax rates for family earning $75,000\nBiden has also added to his proposals since March, Mermin said, including pitching some tax credits that \"could potentially offset some of these increases for the middle-income folks.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\nAn America First Action ad showed Biden saying, \"Guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.\"\nThe ad takes his words out of context. Biden was not speaking about the impact of his plan on all Americans.\nThe comment came during a South Carolina event, when a member of his crowd said he or she had benefited from the GOP-led tax bill. The full context of the quote shows Biden saying that individual\u2019s taxes would be \"raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.\"\nWe rate this ad\u2019s main claim Mostly False.\nLoading\u2026", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17150"}
