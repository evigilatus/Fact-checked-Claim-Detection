That\u2019s because in July 2013, Kuster voted against a House bill that called for delaying the employer mandate.\nIn a blog post, NRCC spokesman Ian Prior wrote that Kuster either lied or has \"absolutely no idea what she is voting for.\"\nKuster did vote against the bill. But does that mean that Kuster has reversed her position on the employer mandate, as NRCC claims?\nShifting dates\nThe politics surrounding any vote on the House floor is complex.\nIn this case, by the time last year\u2019s vote was held, the Obama administration had already announced it would postpone enforcing the employer mandate for one year. So the vote was essentially symbolic.\nThe White House\u2019s preemptive move left some House Republicans peeved, since Obama made the change through his executive authority, rather than by going through Congress. In response, House Republican leaders devised a series of showdown votes aimed at driving a wedge between Democrats and the White House.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, Republicans called a vote on delaying the employer mandate, even though the change had already taken place. They also introduced a second bill to delay the health care law\u2019s mandate on individuals to secure health insurance.\nDemocratic leaders called these measures further attempts to dismantle Obamacare. Obama threatened to veto the bills, specifically calling H.R. 2667 -- the bill delaying the employer mandate -- \"unnecessary.\"\nDespite such calls from the Democratic leadership, House Republicans picked up some Democratic support for the measure. It passed, 264-161, with 35 Democrats voting for it. (The bill delaying the individual mandate also passed the House, though with less Democratic support.)\nKuster\u2019s stand\nKuster voted against both bills, saying they undermined implementation of the health care law. But at the time, Kuster didn\u2019t specifically address the merits of delaying the employer mandate.\nBy contrast, U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter -- another New Hampshire Democrat who voted against both bills -- spelled out her opposition in greater detail.\n\"H.R. 2667 is unnecessary and redundant because President Obama already delayed the employer responsibility provision for one year; a provision that affects only 4 percent of all businesses in America,\" Shea-Porter said.\nWe asked Kuster\u2019s office for the congresswoman\u2019s views on the employer mandate. Spokeswoman Rosie Hilmer said Kuster supported the president\u2019s decision to delay the mandate in 2013, but voted against the Republican bill because it was a \"symbolic bill that would not have helped a single business.\"\n\"Congresswoman Kuster takes her votes very seriously and addresses bills on their value, so she voted against this unnecessary bill because it was a redundant, meaningless stunt by House Republicans, not a serious attempt to address and fix problems with the law,\" Hilmer wrote.\nOur ruling\nKuster recently said she supports the president\u2019s move to delay the small business mandate for another year, saying the delay would provide more time for the New Hampshire marketplace to develop competition among health plans. Critics say that\u2019s a contrast with her vote against a House bill to delay the employer mandate.\nWe agree that there is a contrast between those two positions, but there\u2019s also some nuance.\nKuster didn\u2019t say she opposed the bill because she thought that delaying the employer mandate was a bad idea -- a position that would have been a clear contrast with her more recent position. Rather, she voted against it because the bill was symbolic and tantamount to a stunt, since the White House had already delayed that provision of the law.\nWe rate Kuster\u2019s position on the employer mandate a Half Flip.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08156"}
