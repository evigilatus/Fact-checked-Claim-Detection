The narrator\u2019s first words are, \"Twenty million Americans are out of work,\" and this assertion is bolstered by being repeated in on-screen text:\n\nThis figure sounded high to us, since the official number of unemployed Americans during the most recent month, February, tops out at about 7.8 million.\nSo we asked the Kasich campaign for their evidence, and they proceeded to cite a source that caught us off-guard: Us.\nSpecifically, they pointed to our fact-check from August in which we analyzed a statement by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump said that \"we have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed.\"\nWe rated this claim False, largely because the 93 million number included lots of people who would not be expected to want or be able to work, including full-time students, senior citizens, the disabled, and those who have chosen to take care of their children full-time.\nHowever, in the process, we conducted a mathematical experiment in which we played with possible numbers of Americans who are \"out of work\" that fit somewhere between the official unemployment rate (on the low end) and Trump\u2019s number (on the high end).\nHELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA\u00a0FACT-CHECKER\nHere\u2019s what we wrote, using the statistics that were current at the time:\nThe official number of unemployed Americans is 8.3 million -- less than one-tenth of what Trump says. But to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, it\u2019s possible to expand this number using more credible economic thinking.\nGary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says it\u2019s not unreasonable to include:\n\u2022 The 6.4 million people who haven\u2019t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being \"in the labor force,\" but who say they \"currently want a job.\"\n\u2022 And the 6.5 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job.\nThis would mean that upwards of 21 million Americans could be described with some justification as \"out of work\" involuntarily, either fully or partially. But that\u2019s not even one-quarter of the number that Trump offered.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Nichols, a spokesman for Kasich, said the campaign simply updated our math with more recent data in preparing the television ad.\nThe numbers for January 2016, Nichols said, were:\n\u2022 Unemployed: 7.8 million\n\u2022 People who haven\u2019t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being \"in the labor force,\" but who say they \"currently want a job\": 6.2 million\n\u2022 People working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job: 6 million.\nThat works out to 20 million on the nose.\nWe salute the Kasich campaign\u2019s efforts to fact-check-proof their assertion. Still, we should note that we didn\u2019t intend our calculation to be the final word on how to determine the number of \"out of work\" Americans. Rather, we were trying to provide a benchmark for showing just how wrong Trump\u2019s number was. We\u2019ll note that our wording was that the 21 million figure had \"some justification\" \u2014 not exactly a clarion call for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to change its longstanding protocol.\nIn subsequent fact-checks, though not the one the Kasich campaign referred to, we have added language that is clearer about our intentions. We did that, for instance, in our Feb. 11, 2016, fact-check of a different statement by Trump: \"Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35 (percent). In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.\"\nIn that fact-check, which produced a rating of Pants on Fire, we prefaced a similar alternative calculation this way: \"We are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent.\"\nBut enough from us. What do the two economists we checked with for the original fact-check think about Kasich\u2019s use of the 20 million figure?\n\"Given that the image looks like a guy in an unemployment line, I'd say it's a misleading figure,\" said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs website Indeed.com. Many people have good reasons for not wanting to work now, she said, and that is something distinct from actually being \"out of work.\"\nBurtless agreed, saying, \"The 5.988 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job are not \u2018out of work.\u2019 They are employed, but on a work schedule that does not provide them with the weekly hours they desire.\"\nAt the same time, Burtless said there is still some value in the number cited in Kasich\u2019s advertisement.\n\"Gov. Kasich has given an upper-bound estimate of the total number of Americans who are unemployed or underemployed,\" Burtless said.\nIt\u2019s just not the only estimate.\nOur ruling\nKasich\u2019s ad said that \"20 million Americans are out of work.\"\nThe Kasich campaign shrewdly cites a past PolitiFact item as evidence for this larger-than-usual estimate of America\u2019s \"out of work\" population. But it\u2019s worth noting that the calculation we did was not intended to determine the actual number of out-of-work Americans, but rather to suggest the highest figure with any sort of credibility as a way of seeing how far out of line Trump\u2019s assertion was.\nThe statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05301"}
