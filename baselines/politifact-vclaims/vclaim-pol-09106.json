Just 13 percent unemployment.\"", "truth_label": "true", "date": "stated on July 9, 2013 in an online gubernatorial campaign ad:", "title": "Barbara Buono claims Newark unemployment is 13 percent", "text": "In the months leading up to the gubernatorial primary, Chris Christie was busy flying off to various political events around the country, paying little attention to urban blight, soaring property taxes and double-digit unemployment plaguing some New Jersey neighborhoods.\n\nThat\u2019s the suggestion of a new Internet ad released Tuesday by a group called ChristieNotForNJ.com. Buono, a Democratic state senator from Middlesex County, is running against Christie, a Republican, in November\u2019s governor\u2019s race.\n\nIn the ad, Christie is seen campaigning with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney at a fundraiser in Iowa, followed by a shot of boarded up homes in a blighted neighborhood.\n\n\"Guess what, governor? There\u2019s no fried butter in Newark,\" Buono says in the ad, as a shot from the Iowa State Fair \u2013 where fried butter is a staple delicacy \u2013 plays in the back. \"Just 13 percent unemployment.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll leave the butter assessment for the culinary crowd and look instead at the unemployment claim since New Jersey\u2019s had unusually high unemployment figures even after the recession ended in 2009. But 13 percent for the state\u2019s largest city? It turns out that Newark\u2019s unemployment rate since Christie\u2019s been governor has been quite a bit higher than Buono\u2019s estimate.\n\nBefore looking at unemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, let\u2019s note that the data we reviewed was not seasonally adjusted. As a result, BLS spokeswoman Stacey Standish told us it\u2019s best to use the same month to compare data from different years.\n\nWe decided to look at two time frames: February 2010 \u2013 Christie\u2019s first full month as governor \u2013 to February 2013, and May 2010 to May 2013, the last month for which BLS has unemployment data on Newark. Each time frame allows us to review three years of data. We also looked specifically at the unemployment rate.\n\nStandish confirmed that our methodology for determining Newark\u2019s unemployment rate was correct.\n\nFirst, the February comparisons.\n\nNewark\u2019s unemployment rate was 15.9 percent in February 2010 and 14.6 percent this past February. For the months in between, the jobless rate seesawed between 14.3 percent and nearly 16.5 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let\u2019s compare May unemployment rates in Newark for 2010 and 2013.\n\nThe rate was 15.1 percent in May 2010. The preliminary rate for this past May is 13.7 percent.\n\nThe only months where unemployment fell to 13 percent during Christie\u2019s entire tenure thus far was in April 2012 (13.8 percent), this past April \u00a0(13.2 percent) and May (13.7 percent), according to BLS data.\n\nBuono for Governor spokesman David Turner and Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts did not respond to our requests for comment.\n\nWe also looked at unemployment rates in Camden and Trenton \u2013 other major New Jersey urban centers with large minority populations -- and found those rates were as high or higher.\n\nSo why has Newark\u2019s unemployment rate been so high?\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has acknowledged previously to PolitiFact New Jersey that there\u2019s a high rate of unemployment for blacks. Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP\u2019s Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy, noted in 2011 that initiatives such as education and more training and employment services could help improve those statistics.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBuono said in a new online ad about Christie\u2019s trips to other states, \"Guess what, governor? There\u2019s no fried butter in Newark. Just 13 percent unemployment.\"\n\nData from the BLS shows that for almost all of Christie\u2019s tenure as governor, Newark\u2019s unemployment rate has been at least a full percentage point or two higher than what Buono\u2019s ad claims. There have only been three months in which the city\u2019s unemployment rate was in the 13 percent range: April 2012, April 2013 and a preliminary rate in that range for May.\n\nThe point of Buono\u2019s claim is that Newark has had consistently high unemployment, whether during the few months it was in the 13 percent range or when it stagnated in the 15 percent range. We rate her claim True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09106"}
