That underscores a theme from her address that the state must band together to partner in reform.\nLike Chicago, state government faces its own massive pension overhang. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has ruled out the state stepping in to take over municipal funds, saying that to do so would reduce its credit rating to junk status. However, he has left open the possibility that municipal pension funds could consolidate, pooling their assets to boost investment returns.\nDuring her sit-down with the Sun-Times, Lightfoot was asked how she would keep the rest of the state from viewing an all-in approach on pensions as Chicago getting a \"bailout\" from the state, something critics Downstate claim the city often receives. She responded with this:\n\"We\u2019ve got 600-plus police and fire pensions Downstate that are on the cusp of insolvency because they don\u2019t have the revenues that they need to be able to keep those pensions going,\" she said. \"They\u2019ve done all the things that we have done historically: raised property taxes, sold assets, had their ratings reduced by rating agencies, and they\u2019re out of levers to pull, so they need help just as we do. So this isn\u2019t a Chicago-specific thing.\"\nLightfoot is correct that cities and towns outside Chicago are pressured with mounting pension debt. By raising the specter of insolvency, however, the mayor suggests the situation faced by the vast majority of Downstate public safety pension funds is far more dire than it really is.\nHer claim raises questions on its face because the number she cited references the rough tally for all Downstate police and fire pension funds \u2014 not just those with severe funding gaps.\nEach year, Downstate police and fire pension funds file a report with the Illinois Department of Insurance, or DOI. Data from 2017 filings made by 632 such funds were compiled in a July report by the state legislature\u2019s bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability.\nCollectively, the unfunded liabilities for those funds rose to $11 billion in fiscal year 2017, the commission found, and they had the assets needed to cover 55% of their liabilities. While that\u2019s far from the 90% funding level the state requires them to reach by 2040, it doesn\u2019t suggest most will soon be shuttering. That same year, unfunded liabilities for Chicago\u2019s police and fire funds reached nearly $14.5 billion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeslie Geissler Munger\n\n\nstated on September 15, 2016 in a Chicago Sun-Times editorial board debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My opponent\u2026 was on both the city of Chicago payroll and the state of Illinois payroll simultaneously, taking full salary, funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for 10 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Kevin Hoffman \u2022 September 22, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think highlighting that there are lots of police and fire pension systems that are underfunded is accurate,\" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate to indicate that the majority are on the brink of insolvency.\"\nAfter we reached out to the mayor\u2019s office for clarification, her spokeswoman sent us a response that did not back up Lightfoot\u2019s specific claim.\n\"The mayor\u2019s point that municipalities throughout the state are struggling with their pension obligations is an important one,\" spokeswoman Anel Ruiz wrote in an email. \"Approximately 30% of the 632 public safety pension funds in the state are currently funded at ratios of under 50 percent, according to the Department of Insurance.\"\nThat math tracks with the DOI data included in the commission\u2019s report. For comparison, Chicago\u2019s police and fire pensions are both funded at levels below 25%. Just 25 Downstate public safety funds have a ratio lower than that, records show.\nBut Lightfoot didn\u2019t just reference the declining health of some Downstate public safety funds in the aggregate. Instead, she said more than 600 Downstate pensions are \"on the cusp of insolvency.\"\nOur ruling\nLightfoot said more than 600 police and fire pension funds in Downstate Illinois \"are on the cusp of insolvency because they don\u2019t have the revenues that they need to be able to keep those pensions going.\"\nThe source for that figure refers to the total number of Downstate public safety pensions \u2014 not just those in financial distress. And while the average funded ratio for those funds is far from the target set by the state, experts told us it\u2019s not accurate to claim that nearly all of them are nearing a point where they won\u2019t be able to make payments to current retirees.\nWe rate Lightfoot\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2014 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00182"}
