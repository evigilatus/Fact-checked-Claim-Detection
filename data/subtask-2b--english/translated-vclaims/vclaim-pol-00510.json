From special payment to medical care/assistance to the Affordable Care (Abdominal Care) Act and now to \"Medical Care for All,\" legislators have argued about how, who, and how much Americans should pay for their health care. Mark Buchanan, President of the United States Republic, D-Madison, has been tweeting his endorsement of the proposed Medical Care for All Act, including this tweet from April 30, 2019: \"The United States is the only industrialized country without comprehensive health care. The Medical Care for All Act ensures that everyone living in the United States has access to comprehensive health care and benefits. Today's hearing is a historic step towards that.\" We decided to focus on the first part of the tweet. Is the United States the only industrialized country lacking comprehensive health care? Let's take a look. What's the law on medical care for all? In April 2019, Bernie Sanders of the United States unveiled an updated bill entitled \"Medical care for all.\" The Sanders Plan would establish a government-run system that would provide health care coverage for all Americans. According to an analysis carried out by the National Polytechnic Foundation, medical care for all will replace private insurance, as well as medical insurance and care. The law of expensive care will disappear. A government-run health insurance program will replace them all. The Veterans &apos; Health System will remain in place, as will the Indian Health Services. The new bill on medical care for all largely reflects a previous bill, but this version fully covers long-term care. The PolicFact National has developed a manual for medical care for all, which answers many questions about the program. The United States vs. other countries in June 2015 verified our colleagues at Polity Fact National from a very similar claim by the United States, Sun Bernie Sanders, a democratic presidential candidate: \"We are the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right.\" At that time, a speaker said that Sanders had referred to the member States of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of 36 countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, and 26 others. The group does not include China and Russia, which are classified by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as \"emerging economies.\" In its analysis, the National Polytechnic Organization cited an OECD report issued in 2014 which found that only two member countries lacked universal health care coverage: Mexico had enacted a law in 2004 with a view to reaching universal coverage, but had not reached it at the time of the verification of the facts. In 2013, coverage was about 87 per cent of the population. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 15 January 2021, however, by 2018, Mexico had implemented a public health care system known as the Mexican Institute for Social Development, which provides comprehensive health care to Mexican families and foreign residents registered in the system. The other country on the OECD list: United States. (Note: Sanders formulated his claim around major countries with a guaranteed right to health care, speaking as if every advanced economy had it. In fact, some do, and some don't. In this way, Sanders' claim was classified as half a Tro.) In this regard, Buchanan &apos; s claim is more clear - he spoke of universal coverage. The e-mails sent to the Buchanan office to request further information on his claim were rejected. However, Buchanan spoke of industrialized nations, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is therefore a good starting point. An article published by the Economist on 26 April 2018 noted: \"Despite the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, America remains a distant country in the provision of health care. It has some of the best hospitals in the world, but it is also the only rich country with no universal health coverage. The costs of health care can be financially devastating.\" On May 14, 2017, an op-ed article in the conversation, Timothy Callahan, Assistant Professor at the Centre for Health Sciences of the University of Texas A&M, cited several reasons why the United States might not adopt such a system: \"Unusually individual culture favours personal responsibility over government; pressure groups are particularly active, spending billions to ensure that private insurance companies maintain their status in the health system; and our institutions are designed in a way that limits major changes in social policy from happening.\" The World Research Organization, an independent research and media organization based in Montreal, Canada, in a paper dated 9 July 2017, entitled \"The America is the only developed country without comprehensive health care,\" stated that States providing comprehensive coverage provide one of the following three forms: The Government provides one wage; :: Provision of basic care at two levels, together with secondary coverage, which provides more services on the basis of capacity to pay; Compulsory insurance from the employer or individual buyers, supplementing the national coverage. The report classified countries in this way and noted that when OECD - to less industrialized countries - went beyond, dozens of countries had access to comprehensive health care. Among them are Belarus, Mongolia, Romania, Tajikistan and Uruguay. Our referee, Buchanan, said, \"The United States is the only industrialized country without comprehensive health care.\" Our research, including fact-finding by the National Polyte Fact Company, made this clear. Indeed, there are many non-industrial countries that also provide health care for all. We're assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00510"}
