All under Chris Christie\u2019s leadership.\n\u00a0\nNew Jersey was a broken state before Christie became governor, but now that he\u2019s here and has made tough decisions, the state is on a more positive and fiscally sound path, a new television ad claims.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey\u2019s best teachers, and the most education funding ever,\" a narrator states as scenes of a gritty New Jersey and the aftermath of October\u2019s Hurricane Sandy, play.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis fact-check looks strictly at the ad\u2019s claims about balanced budgets, new taxes and job growth. Two of the claims are on target. We will fact-check the ad\u2019s education-related claims Sunday.\n\u00a0\nThe governor claims he balanced four budgets and he\u2019s correct. But it\u2019s hardly an accomplishment that distinguishes Christie from any other governor since state law requires a balanced spending plan.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo new taxes for anyone, however, is debatable.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDuring a 2011 town hall meeting in Evesham Township, Christie ruled out any tax increases, according to a fact sheet for the ad shared by Christie For Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut other actions by the governor could be construed as raising taxes, experts have previously told PolitiFact New Jersey.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlthough rates for income, sales and corporate business taxes have not gone up under Christie, Christie has cut funding to several tax credit programs that have the same effect as tax increases.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere\u2019s one example: New Jersey scaled back the state\u2019s Earned Income Tax Credit -- which the state Treasury Department website said \"reduces the amount of New Jersey tax you owe and may also give you a refund, even if you have no tax liability to New Jersey\" -- in Christie\u2019s first year in office.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough rates didn\u2019t increase, some homeowners and some low-income individuals received less money to offset tax bills \u2013 and that\u2019s a type of increase, professors from the University of California Davis School of Law, and at The George Washington University, told us.\n\u00a0\nBill Quinn, a Treasury Department spokesman, said at the time that \"the Earned Income Tax Credit in most cases really represents a subsidy payment to low income citizens,\" pointing out that more than 76 percent of earned income tax credit recipients in 2010 owed no New Jersey tax.\n\u00a0\nNext, let\u2019s review that claim about New Jersey having the best job growth in 12 years, amounting to about 130,000 new private-sector jobs.\n\u00a0\nThe claim is accurate, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. New Jersey saw an inrease of 66,400 total payroll jobs from December 2011 through 2012. There is no other annual timeframe, measured from December to December, that had as high an increase in the previous 12 years, said Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.\n\u00a0\nThe state also had the best year-over-year increase in private-sector jobs from December 2011 to December 2012, at 59,100, he said. New Jersey also added 127,800 private sector jobs from February 2010 \u2013 Christie\u2019s first full month in office -- through March 2013, Seneca said in an e-mail.\n\u00a0\nSeneca said Christie\u2019s bipartisan efforts to control costs, not raise taxes and to reduce inefficiences that increase business costs all factor into New Jersey\u2019s improving business climate.\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA new ad by Christie for Governor claims that under the governor\u2019s leadership, the state has had \"four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey\u2019s best teachers, and the most education funding ever.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s true that Christie has balanced four budgets -- as required by state law, but some experts have told us that cuts in tax credit programs can be deemed tax increases.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn terms of job gains, the news is positive for year-over-year data, growth in the past decade and since Christie\u2019s been in office. A Rutgers economist confirmed that some of Christie\u2019s actions are responsible for those gains.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe rate these claims Mostly True.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead Part 2 of our fact-check of this ad on Sunday.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09357"}
