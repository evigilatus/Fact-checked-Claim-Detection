PolitiFact wanted to see for ourselves if 3 million people, a number we\u2019ve seen disputed, have really benefited from that change.\nThe White House pointed us to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services June 2012 report for the source of Obama\u2019s number.\nBetween September 2010 and December 2011, the percentage of 19- to 25-year-olds on their families\u2019 insurance increased from 64.4 percent to 74.8 percent, according to the National Health Interview Survey. HSS then took that increase of 10.4 percentage points and multiplied it by the number of people in that age group, which, according to Census data, was 29.7 million in 2010, to arrive at nearly 3.1 million newly insured people.\nTheir estimate is two years old and hasn\u2019t been updated, though they say they it will be going forward.\nThe administration\u2019s calculation isn\u2019t the only method you could use to evaluate the impact of the law\u2019s increased coverage for young adults. Forbes opinion editor Avik Roy, a former Mitt Romney adviser and Obamacare critic, took down the 3.1 million figure and estimated that the true number is more like 930,000. \u00a0\nFactors that affect the estimate include:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe starting point for counting uninsured young adults, and whether that is pre-recession\n\n\nThe data set used for counting uninsured young adults\n\n\nThe year the estimate was last updated\n\n\nOthers have questioned Obama\u2019s estimate as well. Our fact-checking colleague Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post published his own estimate of 2.2 million people, after using updated National Health Interview Surveys and also averaging 2010 figures instead of cherrypicking the third quarter, the year\u2019s low point for uninsured young adults.\nTimothy Jost, a Washington and Lee health care law professor who supports the law, said more than 3 million might be a high estimate, but Roy\u2019s is too low. Again, he acknowledged that there are a number of different ways to arrive at the estimate, but his best guess is 2.5 million.\nEveryone agreed that the number of young adults covered definitely increased as a result of the law. But there\u2019s no telling by exactly how much.\nOur ruling\nObama said more than 3 million adults aged 19 to 25 got health coverage as a result of an Affordable Care Act mandate that allows those individuals to remain on their families\u2019 private plans.\nThere\u2019s no way to get an exact figure, and estimates range anywhere from less than 1 million to 3.1 million. Obama\u2019s estimate may be quite high, but his point that the law\u2019s mandate has increased coverage in that age range is spot on. We rate his claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08029"}
