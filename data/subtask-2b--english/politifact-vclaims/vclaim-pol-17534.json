But the details don\u2019t square with what happened.\nThe post features a letter purportedly written by a man named Ron Knouse. He describes how he and other soldiers had to wait four days for buses to the airport because there was a shortage of planes at the end of Operation Desert Storm.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Finally, the buses came and took the young man to the airport. The planes waiting were from Tower Air. The owner of Tower Air had volunteered his planes and staff to bring soldiers home for the cost of fuel only. Happily, the young veteran got home just in time for Easter weekend in 1991 and spent that time emotionally healing with friends and family surrounding him\u2026\n\"The Airline owner \u2013 Donald J Trump.\n\"This needs to go viral. He\u2019s done so many good things you never hear about.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nDonald Trump did operate an airline at one time. But the details of the letter are inaccurate. Trump did not own Tower Air, and we found no evidence he assisted in the transport of military personnel from Saudi Arabia.\nBeyond that, Trump\u2019s airline \u2014 Trump Shuttle \u2014 was being controlled by a consortium of banks, not Trump, when the United States military chartered flights from the airline for personnel transport. That was for flights within the United States, not from Saudi Arabia.\nThe end of Trump Shuttle\nA different story about a Trump plane transporting 200 marines from North Carolina to Florida after Operation Desert Storm in 1991 emerged when conservative talk radio host Sean Hannity aired a now-deleted segment about it in May 2016, during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. In that version, about 200 Marines took two trips on a Trump-owned plane from North Carolina to Florida after a logistics error left them stranded.\u00a0\nWhile Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign allegedly confirmed the story, details show that he was not personally involved in transporting any American troops.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump ran the airline for a short time. In May 1989, he purchased Eastern Airlines for $365 million, renaming it Trump Shuttle. The airline operated short flights in the northeastern United States using a fleet of Boeing 727 airliners.\nA 2016 fact-check by the Washington Post reported that while some Trump Shuttle planes did transport military personnel around the country in the early 1990s, it was the U.S. military that chartered those flights, not Trump personally.\nRetired Lt. Gen. Vernon Kondra, who was in charge of all military airlift operations at the time, told the newspaper his notes indicated several references to a 1990-91 contract for Trump Shuttle to carry personnel across the country. He said it would have made little sense if Trump personally arranged the flights and said he was \"certainly not aware\" of him being involved.\nTrump wasn\u2019t in a position to donate plane rides, anyway.\nNYC Aviation reported that he had defaulted on his loan in September 1990, and control of the airline went back to the banks until it was sold to US Air. US Air agreed in late 1991 to operate the airline with an option to buy it outright after five years. By April 1992, Trump Shuttle had ceased to exist when it was merged into a new corporation, Shuttle, Inc., which began operating as the USAir Shuttle.\nTower Air\nTrump\u2019s name does not appear anywhere in the nearly 20-year history of Tower Air, which is mentioned as being owned by Trump in the Facebook post.\nThe airline contracted with the Department of Defense to transport soldiers on charter flights in the early 1990s and was founded by Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi and Sam Fondlier in 1982, according to Airline History records.\u00a0\nWhen Tower Air filed for bankruptcy in May 2000, Nachtomi was listed as its CEO.\u00a0\nTo summarize our findings, Trump Shuttle planes were contracted by the U.S. military to transport personnel around the country while the airline was in the process of being sold; it was not under Trump\u2019s control at the time. Trump was not affiliated with Tower Air, which contracted with the Department of Defense in the 1990s to transport soldiers stationed overseas.\nWe rate this Facebook story False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17534"}
