The image did not disclose that the quotes were satirical.\n\"Senate Democrats demand Supreme Court nominee not be unduly influenced by U.S. Constitution,\" the image said in bold yellow font. The image featured photos of Sens. Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, each with a quote attributed to them.\n\nThe quotes purported to portray the Democratic senators as more interested in pushing an agenda than abiding by constitutional laws.\n\"Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,\" Schumer is quoted saying. \"And it\u2019s always \u2014 always \u2014 the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don\u2019t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it\u2019s time for that to end.\"\nThe image also quoted Warren saying, \"We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws, not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the image alleged that Booker said, \"We\u2019re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do.\"\nSeveral readers sent us emails flagging the image and asking that we check it out, so we did.
