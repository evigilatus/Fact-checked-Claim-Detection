The argument made to Kavanaugh and two other appellate court judges was that Congress had overstepped its constitutional powers. Two of the judges nixed the challenge, saying that, yes, Congress actually did have the power.\nKavanaugh also rejected the challenge, but for a totally different, technical reason. Basically, he said it was too early for the court to rule.\nSo, both the two judges and Kavanaugh reached the same place, but his fellow judges upheld Congress\u2019s power to impose the mandate, and Kavanaugh, by sidestepping that question, did not.\nNotice that the case wasn\u2019t directly about patient protections, most notably the ban on denying coverage based on a pre-existing health condition. But all the judges agreed that those protections and the mandate were joined at the hip. They all said that the mandate made the patient protections work economically.\nThe dividing line was two judges affirmed Congress\u2019s power to make the package work and Kavanaugh did not. But he still rejected the challenge.\nMore detail: What Kavanaugh\u2019s dissent means, and doesn\u2019t\nIn the case of Seven-Sky vs. Holder, a group of taxpayers argued that the health care law\u2019s requirement to buy health insurance went beyond the legitimate power of Congress.\nTwo out of the three appellate judges rejected the challenge outright, saying that the mandate was allowed under the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause.\nIn his dissent, Kavanaugh shot down the challenge but pointedly avoided ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 big issue.\n\"I do not take a position here on whether the statute as currently written is justifiable under the Taxing Clause or the Commerce Clause,\" he wrote.\nInstead, he rejected the claim based on tax law.\nHe said the suit itself was flawed because an 1867 law \u2014 the Anti-Injunction Act \u2014 blocks courts from ruling on tax laws before they take effect. It was 2011, and the mandate didn\u2019t come into force until 2014, so \"a suit challenging the individual mandate cannot be entertained until 2015.\"\nWhere do patient protections come into this?\nWell, key protections, most prominently the ban on denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition, come hand-in-hand with the mandate in Obamacare. As Kavanaugh saw it, you can\u2019t have one without the other.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother name for that ban is guaranteed coverage, and during oral arguments, Kavanaugh said that part of the Affordable Care Act was fine.\n\"Congress has the power to impose a guaranteed issue requirement on insurance companies,\" he said.\nGoing further, there\u2019s no mistaking that Kavanaugh saw\u00a0the link to the mandate.\n\"It won\u2019t work without an individual mandate attached to it,\" he said. \"We know that from the states that have tried it that way. It didn\u2019t work. Massachusetts tried it with the mandate and it\u2019s worked extremely well, at least in terms of the goal of coverage.\"\nSo Kavanaugh was content to give patient protections the constitutional thumbs up, but when it came to the other half of the equation, the mandate, he said it was too soon to make a decision on its constitutionality.\nInterpreting what Kavanaugh did\nFor the makers of the ad, this is very simple.\n\"Two judges upheld the Affordable Care Act and its patient protections, and he declined to uphold it,\" Demand Justice executive director Brian Fallon said. \"He could have joined their opinion and upheld it on the merits and he didn't.\"\nFor outside legal experts, the situation is much cloudier.\n\"The group\u2019s statement is technically true, although a bit misleading,\" said Allison K. Hoffman at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. \"Kavanaugh never said that the mandate was unconstitutional. He painstakingly avoided opining on its constitutionality. He spent 65 excruciatingly dense pages of opinion repeatedly calling it a tax, the very thing Congress avoided doing because they knew it would be unpopular.\"\nJames Blumstein at Vanderbilt agreed that by taking no position on the reach of the Commerce Clause, Kavanaugh succeeded in placing himself in the gray zone regarding congressional power.\n\"Kavanaugh was unwilling to endorse the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause,\" Blumstein said. \"He wanted to avoid having to decide what was for him a hard question.\"\nIn his dissent, Kavanaugh emphasized an important principle that stands apart from assessing congressional power: judicial restraint. That\u2019s the idea that courts should not get ahead of the political process that plays out in the nation and Congress.\n\"I see in his declining to address that issue (the mandate) only normal judicial prudence of not deciding issues unless the case requires them to be decided,\" Wake Forest University\u2019s Mark Hall told us.\nAnd law professor David Gamage at Indiana University said Kavanaugh\u2019s dissent makes him neither \"pro-Affordable Care Act, nor anti-Affordable Care Act.\"\nOur ruling\nThe group Demand Justice said that Kavanaugh refused to uphold patient protections. Looking at the record, it is fair to say that he did not uphold the power of Congress to impose the individual insurance mandate. That is one step removed from upholding patient protections, but Kavanaugh said that the two are tightly linked, and there\u2019s broad agreement on that point.\nBut while he didn\u2019t uphold that power, his dissent didn\u2019t specifically negate it. Outside legal scholars said there\u2019s only so much one can read into his opinion.\nIn oral arguments, Kavanaugh said both that the patient protections are legal and that in order to work in the marketplace, they require the individual mandate. \u00a0\nIn his dissent, he avoided saying whether Congress has the power to impose the mandate, thus leaving the viability of the patient protections in limbo.\nWe rate this statement Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-18 17:16:54 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says Brett Kavanaugh \"refused to uphold key patient protections in the past.\"     Demand Justice An advocacy group with Democratic ties focused on judicial appointments https://youtu.be/5mGxNVPuVZo   In a television ad Thursday, July 12, 2018 2018-07-12    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01846"}
