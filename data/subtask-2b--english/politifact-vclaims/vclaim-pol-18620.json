(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve previously fact-checked two other social media posts about AARP. Claims that a portion of member dues goes directly to the Democratic Party and that the organization backed \"federal funding for Planned Parenthood\" are both False.\nThis new claim is also wrong.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJason Young, a spokesperson for AARP, told us that the organization hasn\u2019t endorsed any candidate in the presidential election.\u00a0\nIn fact, AARP has a policy against endorsing or appearing to endorse political parties, government officials or candidates for office. AARP\u2019s board of directors, state presidents, state directors and others associated with the organization also are forbidden to participate in any public political or partisan activity that could be construed as an AARP endorsement. That includes circulating petitions or putting a candidate\u2019s bumper sticker on their car.\u00a0\u00a0\nYoung also told us that AARP doesn\u2019t fund \u2014\u00a0and has never funded \u2014\u00a0Planned Parenthood. He shared a 2018 letter from the director of AARP Minnesota to a volunteer who had been confronted by people at an event who thought AARP supports Planned Parenthood financially.\u00a0\n\"I want to ensure you \u2014\u00a0and I encourage you to share this letter as necessary \u2014\u00a0that AARP does not fund and has not funded Planned Parenthood,\" the letter says.\u00a0\nWe reviewed AARP\u2019s most recent IRS filing \u2014 for 2018, filed in November 2019 \u2014 that details money it contributed to other organizations. Planned Parenthood was not among them. We also reviewed the five previous years and saw no such contributions.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18620"}
