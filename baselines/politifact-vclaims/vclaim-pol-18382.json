Whitmer did not spend May 20 at her vacation home", "text": "Some Facebook users say they have proof that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer isn\u2019t following her own stay-at-home order.\nOn May 20, conservative radio host Randy Bishop posted an image that shows two cars outside a blue house and a garage. In the caption, he claimed it was taken that afternoon at Whitmer\u2019s \"\u2018UpNorth Cottage\u2019 in Antrim County.\"\n\"Evidently Gov. Whitmer's \u2018Stay Home, Stay Safe\u2019 executive orders DON'T apply to HER family!!!\" Bishop wrote.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nSince Whitmer, a Democrat, has been the target of several hoaxes about her handling of the coronavirus pandemic, we wanted to check out this Facebook post, too.\nWe did not find definitive proof that the photo was taken on May 20, but the photo did not appear online prior to that date. The governor\u2019s office says Whitmer was not at her second home on May 20. We reached out to Bishop for his evidence, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nAn executive order signed by Whitmer that went into effect mid-April prohibited people from traveling between two residences. Although she has extended her stay-at-home order through June 12, the provision banning travel to second homes within the state has been dropped.\n\"Michiganders may travel between their residences, but I still strongly discourage people from doing so unless it is absolutely necessary,\" Whitmer said in late April. \"We ask that you consider not doing that.\"\nWhitmer lives in the governor\u2019s mansion in Lansing, but her primary residence is in East Lansing, according to her 2018 financial disclosure. The document also lists a \"family lake house\" in Elk Rapids, a town in northern Michigan.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA May 20 article from the Gateway Pundit appears to back up Bishop\u2019s claim that Whitmer\u2019s family spent the afternoon at their lake house. The conservative website researched the license plate on the black Chevrolet Tahoe in the photo and found that it belongs to Marc Mallory, Whitmer\u2019s husband.\n\"Gretchen and Marc were at their summer home today,\" the Gateway Pundit wrote.\nThat\u2019s inaccurate, according to the Michigan governor\u2019s office.\n\"The governor was in Midland to tour the devastating flood damage and meet with first responders as they evacuated thousands of people to safety,\" a spokeswoman told PolitiFact in an email. \"She then returned to her home in Lansing.\"\nMedia reports confirm that Whitmer spent May 20 in Midland. The next day, she held a press conference in Lansing about the state\u2019s coronavirus response.\nThere is some evidence that Mallory could have been at the couple\u2019s home in Elk Rapids.\nUsing public records searches and Google Earth, we confirmed that the car in the Facebook photo belongs to Mallory and the house is the family\u2019s property on Birch Lake.\u00a0\nThe Detroit News reported that the owner of NorthShore Dock LLC, a company near Birch Lake, said in Facebook posts that Mallory had called to try to get his boat in the water before Memorial Day weekend. The posts, which have since been deleted, attracted the ire of Republican state lawmakers, who say Whitmer\u2019s family may not be following her own stay-at-home guidance.\nWe asked the governor\u2019s office about the veracity of the Facebook posts, but we haven\u2019t heard back. Whitmer said Tuesday that Mallory\u2019s call to the dock company, during which he asked if his status as the governor\u2019s husband would help get his boat in the water, was a joke.\n\"He thought it might get a laugh,\" Whitmer said. \"It didn't, and to be honest I wasn't laughing either when it was relayed to me because I knew how it would be perceived.\"\nRegardless, there is no evidence that Whitmer spent the afternoon of May 20 at her house in Elk Rapids. And even if she did, it would not have violated her current stay-at-home order.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18382"}
