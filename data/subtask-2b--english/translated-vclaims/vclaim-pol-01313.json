Therefore, under this executive order, his son will not be an American citizen.\" This story was highlighted as part of Facebook &apos; s efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let's start with Trump's youngest son. Baron, aged 12, was already born on 20 March 2006. His mother, Tramp's wife, Melania, from Slovenia. She worked in New York as a model and dated Trump when she applied for a visa in 2000, according to the BBC. She obtained a green card when her application was approved the following year. On March 20, 2006, Baron was born in New York and became an American citizen four months later in July 2006. The Trump News, which targets birthright citizenship, was published by Axis, who airs an exclusive interview with the President today, Nov 4. A story containing excerpts from that conversation was published on the Axis web site on 30 October, and while the article discusses when Trump has the ability to use an executive order, it does not explain exactly what this would say in this case. Following the campaign in 2015, Tramp developed a plan to end the right to citizenship of children of illegal immigrants. However, we do not yet know the details of a possible executive order to terminate the right to citizenship, including whether it applies to children with one parent who is a citizen or a non-citizen. The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, subject to its jurisdiction, are citizens of the United States and the State in which they reside.\" The amendment was ratified in 1868 and was intended to extend citizenship to former slaves who had recently been released following the civil war. The amendment goes on to prevent States from depriving any person of \"life, liberty or property, without due process of law\" or \"denial of the protection of laws on an equal basis with any person under their jurisdiction.\" Baron Trump, born on United States soil, is a citizen of the United States because of the 14th Amendment and apart from that: had he been born abroad, he would still have been considered a citizen. United States The citizenship and immigration services have a policy that a child born outside the United States should become a citizen at birth if at that time one of the parents was a foreign national and the other was an American citizen who had been in the country for at least five years, including at least two years after that person had reached the age of 14. Legal researchers and Tramp critics have questioned whether Trump has a unilateral power to issue an executive order that is directly inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. The fact-finding articles mentioned on January 11, 2021 in Facebook by Samantha Buterman, Speaker of the House of Representatives, were no longer written by Curie Pritchnyder, Professor of Political Science at Brown University, in November 3, for Guardian, \"The executive order cannot reflect the guarantee of citizenship for anyone born in the United States as provided for in the Constitution. Congress cannot issue a law to do so. The idea is enshrined in the Constitution and can only be changed by formal amendment.\" For a constitutional amendment to be approved, it must be proposed by a two-thirds majority in both the Council and the Senate. It would then have to be ratified by three quarters of States. In an interview with Slat on 30 October, Vice-President Mike Pines said that Trump viewed the Citizenship Act widely and suggested that the matter might need to be brought before the highest court in the country: \"We all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the United States Supreme Court has never ruled whether the 14th Amendment language under its jurisdiction specifically applies to persons in the country illegally.\" In the meantime, Speaker Paul Ryan rejected the idea that Trump could terminate true citizenship by giving birth by executive order: \"I believe in pursuing the simple text of the Constitution, and in this case I believe that the 14th Amendment is very clear,\" said Ryan on October 30, \"and this will involve a very long constitutional process.\" Our Facebook article says that \"by an executive order\" from President Trump to cancel true citizenship, Trump Barone's son \"will not be an American citizen.\" We do not yet know the details, scope or effect of the executive order that Trump is planning. But we know that the 14th Amendment guarantees the citizenship of Baron Trump. We know that even if Baron Trump was born elsewhere, he would be an American citizen because his father was an American citizen who was in the United States five years before Baron was born. Scientists point out that the abolition of the nationality of the right to birth requires much more than a mere executive order. Any executive order that tries to do so is likely to face legal challenges. As Poletti Fatte Louis Jacobson wrote on October 30, \"All Trump can do is sign such an executive order with a clear expectation that opponents will be sued to prevent its execution. After that, it will be up to the courts to decide the final outcome.\" We value this allegation wrong.
