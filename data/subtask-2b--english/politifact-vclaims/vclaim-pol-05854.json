Nothing in almost three decades? A bold claim, especially for a Rhode Island politician.\nIt\u2019s true Chafee has never been charged, indicted, convicted or imprisoned. During those 30 years, one governor, the mayor of Providence and a gaggle of others have gone to prison. \u00a0\nBut scandal isn\u2019t strictly a legal term. According to the dictionary, a scandal is a public disgrace. We kept that in mind as we reviewed Chafee\u2019s 30 years of public service.\nOne story jumped out at us. A controversy about the purchase of frogs \u2014 yes frogs for the mayor\u2019s aquarium \u2014 as well as toboggans, theater tickets, flowers and other items totalling thousands of dollars a year.\nChafee\u2019s office bought the four frogs, which cost $1.99 each in 1997, and the rest of the stuff with taxpayers\u2019 money from a discretionary account for the Warwick mayor\u2019s office.\nThe story blew up in 2000 as Chafee ran to keep his U.S. Senate seat. Chafee said other mayors had used the same account. But, he said, he was the first mayor to keep records on expenses.\nUnimpressed, Chafee\u2019s critics charged he had inappropriately spent taxpayer money. One, mayoral candidate, Michael Woods, the 43-year-old brother of actor James Woods, called for a state police investigation.\n\u00a0The Journal\u2019s archives include two chapters in Chafee\u2019s life that are more personal.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order \u201cfor all federal vehicles\u201d to be electric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some politicians, college escapades involving cocaine or other narcotics, are fodder for scandal, especially when it\u2019s something that\u2019s concealed initially.\nChafee\u2019s experience with cocaine was still under wraps in the late \u201990s and when the much anticipated questions finally came, he took pride in his transparent response. He immediately admitted his use of cocaine. And moved on with his career.\nAs governor, there was another controversy surrounding the state\u2019s handling of an underage drinking party thrown by Chafee\u2019s 18-year-old son Caleb Chafee on the family\u2019s Exeter property in 2012.\nThe younger Chafee pleaded no contest to a criminal charge of violating the social host law; the state police never released the records on their investigation of the governor\u2019s son. Some suggested that this raised questions about the possibility that there was something to hide.\nAs governor, Chafee made an appointment in the final days of his administration that critics saw as a violation of the state\u2019s revolving-door law.\nChafee nominated a top aide and political ally, Richard Licht, for a state judgeship. The state ethics commission allowed the nomination, but critics argued the\u00a0law should have been applied to Licht, the state\u2019s director of administration.\nFinally, in the first six months of the Raimondo administration, revelations about the management of the Department of Transportation and the Department of Children, Youth and Families have raised questions about conduct in those departments under Chafee.\nOur ruling\nIn his opening remarks Tuesday night Chafee said: \"I\u2019m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals.\"\nWe\u2019re not entirely sure what Chafee considers a scandal. We reached out to Chafee\u2019s spokeswoman to get the candidate\u2019s definition, but she said she would need more time to respond. \u00a0\nThe dictionary again says a scandal is a public disgrace. Over\u00a0the past 30 years, Chafee has had his share of controversy, and an occasional brush with scandal.\nBut scandal, a full blown public disgrace? Probably not.\nAfter all, in the broader scheme of things, is it disgraceful to buy four frogs for $7.96 to amuse visitors to the mayor\u2019s office?\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05854"}
