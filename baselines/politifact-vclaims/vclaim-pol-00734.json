It is the second-highest number of cases reported in the United States since measles was eliminated in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNow, another anti-vaccine claim has surfaced on Facebook on a page called Greeninfo.com, which describes itself as an \"alternative and holistic health service.\"\nThe post reads: \"Think combined doses of vaccines have been tested? They haven\u2019t. Not once. EVER. Our children deserve better.\"\nThe post, which provides no details or evidence, has been shared over 600 times since April 15 and was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase: The claim is false \u2013 all vaccines are tested for years before and after being made available to the public, including \"combined doses.\"\nWe reached out to Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute For Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, on the veracity of the claim.\n\"This is not a true statement,\" he told us in an email.\nSalmon pointed us to a December 2008 document from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The review covered federal vaccine safety programs and public health activities.\" The summary begins:\nThe evaluation of safety for vaccines is conducted through a network of diverse, yet integrated activities that cuts across Federal agency responsibilities and includes the private sector and academic investigators. The development, licensure and widespread use of a vaccine involves activities and programs from a broad range of groups, including State health departments, academia, industry, healthcare providers, professional organizations, third party payers, managed care organizations, philanthropic and service organizations, and agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) in the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).\nAccording to Health and Human Services vaccine safety page, which is coordinated by the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO), every licensed and recommended vaccine goes through years of safety testing. This includes testing and evaluation before the vaccine is licensed and recommended, as well as monitoring after it is recommended for the public.\n\"Before a vaccine is ever recommended for use it\u2019s tested in labs. This process can take several years. FDA uses the information from these tests to decide whether to test the vaccine with people,\" the page says. \"During a clinical trial, a vaccine is tested on people who volunteer to get vaccinated. Clinical trials start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.\"\nThe CDC\u2019s multiple vaccines information page reports that data shows getting several vaccines at the same time does not cause any chronic health problems.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y.
