(Scott Walker) With jobs and the economy the main focus of the narrow race between Walker and the Democratic Challenge, Governor Mary Burke wrote a report that says that the state added an estimated 8,400 jobs in September. A day after the figures came out, hours before his second discussion with Burke, Wicker told the Wisconsin Municipal League in a speech on October 17, 2014: \" Yesterday afternoon, the Labour Force Development Department in Wisconsin announced that our numbers of employment, and the number of jobs created in the private sector last month, in September, were 8,400 -- 8,400 new jobs in the private sector created in Wisconsin last month.\" \"This is the biggest job creation in the private sector we've had in September in more than a decade. In more than a decade.\" In the days that followed, Walker repeated the claim several times. Is he right? The \"September Business Report\" is a preliminary report. A monthly survey of 3.5 per cent of state employers was drawn from the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics. Thus, monthly figures have a large margin of error and can swing widely when they become final. This batch, for example, has an error margin of 7,980. The figures can change again later, when more accurate quarterly figures - based on a census of almost every government employer - can be used to adjust the monthly figures. However, the figures are the latest available figures. When we asked for support from the Walker campaign, Elie Marrie's spokesperson explained that they were the most recent issue per month, and noted that these numbers were widely reported every month. When we looked at a decade of data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics, September 2014 came out at the Summit: 2005: 2000: 2006 1:200: 2007: - 3,700: 2008: - 8,700: Check out the facts that Sarah Goodlowski stated on January 9, 2021 on Twitter: \"Not all women lost jobs (in the December job report), most of them black and Latin women. \u2022 15 January, 2021 2009: 400 2010: - 3,200 in 2011: 4,400 in 2012: 6,400 in 2013: 1,300 in 2014: 8,400 in 2014: the second largest job gain for this time frame was the addition of 6,400 jobs in September 2012. The pendulum turned in the other direction in 2008, during the worst period of economic contraction, when 8,700 jobs were lost in that month. The September 2014 figures are certainly preliminary and previous years &apos; figures are final. So, there's a little orange apple going on in comparison. However, when we often assessed Walker's claim that it was correct to compare Wisconsin to the Western Central States for job growth over the past year, a federal BLS official told us that it was reasonable to compare the initial figure with the previous year, with the understanding that the new figure was not definitive. In that claim, the initial figures for July 2014 were compared with the final figures for July 2013. This comparison showed that the State ranks third in the Middle West. Of course, we cannot predict what the revised post figure will be in September when the next round of statements will be issued in November 2014. But if it's revised by 2,000 jobs or more, that's not gonna be the best September in ten years. Once again, the claim of better growth in Midwest is useful. When the final figures appeared, the third to fourth order fell. \u2219 (and) Walker revised his point. In any event, we can only assess the claim on the basis of what is known at the time of its submission. This one holds up, even on another scale. As we have extracted the initial September reports over the past years, so that we can see how the initial figures for September 2014 compared to the initial figures for last September (we are sort of obsessed with this way). The 2013 records were complicated by the closure of the federal government and comparative data prior to 2009 not available. However, the initial number of 8,400 posts in 2014 exceeded 2012 (an increase of 1,500), 2011 (a decrease of 900) and 2010 (a decrease of 9,900). The use of numbers in the past will be noted by the nearest readers that Walker had a strong relationship between love and love hate with monthly numbers, and that he's not the only one who's ever been there. In December 2011, Labour Force Development Minister Reggie Newson described the figures in this way: \"These unreliable employment statistics from Washington misrepresent public information and create unnecessary concern for job seekers and job starters about the shape of our nation's economy.\" Instead, government officials - including Walker - began to emphasize the more accurate quarterly figures. Until the campaign season, when the monthly figures belonged to Fogg. So we put Walker's views on the numbers on the Flip-O-Meter, and we classified them on a full package. But here we simply evaluate what Walker said: The truth - O-Meter has no hypocrisy. Our evaluation (Walker) claims that the September report, which showed an increase of 8,400 jobs, was the best in the last 10 years that month. This is piling up. An official in BLS says that the approach is legitimate, with another year's warning being preliminary. Therefore, we appreciate the claim that it is often true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07066"}
