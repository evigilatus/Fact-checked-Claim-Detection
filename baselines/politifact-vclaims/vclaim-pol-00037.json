Get the police out of the schools.\"\nThen the ad shows four \"real moms, not actors,\" sitting at a kitchen table, holding coffee mugs and disagreeing with Bynum-Coleman.\n\"That\u2019s scary,\"\u00a0the first woman says. \"I don\u2019t want my kids in an environment where they\u2019re not going to be safe.\"\nThe second woman says police are \"heroes.\" The third says the officers are at schools\u00a0 \"as an added layer of protection.\" The fourth says, \"I just want my daughter to be safe.\"\nThe ad returns to the first woman, who says, \"As a mom, I wouldn\u2019t vote for Sheila Bynum-Coleman. I just wouldn\u2019t.\"\nDuring much of commercial, there\u2019s type on the screen saying, \"We need to get the police out of the schools - Sheila Bynum-Coleman.\"\nBynum-Coleman says Cox has distorted comments she made two years ago. So we fact-checked Cox\u2019s ad claim.\nThe commercial cites as its source an Oct. 9, 2017 podcast interview of Bynum-Coleman by Marcello Rollando, a performing arts director and liberal activist. Bynum-Coleman was asked for her thoughts on the \"school to prison pipeline,\" the trend of a disproportionate number of black students being expelled from schools or arrested.\nIn a lengthy reply, Bynum-Coleman\u00a0said many schools were relegating\u00a0 routine student discipline to on-site police and security guards. She did say \"we need to get the police out of the schools,\" as Cox claims in his ad. But the commercial omits Bynum Coleman saying in her next breath the officers are needed to provide safety.\u00a0\nHere are her expanded remarks:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But now we have police in the school who are policing our children, you know we don\u2019t want children to get into fights, we don\u2019t want them walking into class late, we don\u2019t want them being disruptive in the classrooms, but do we want to send them to prison?\n\"I think there\u2019s an alternative here and I think we need to get the police out of the schools. The police need to be there for safety measures and to make sure the school is safe, not to incarcerate the children and deal with disciplinary actions, and that\u2019s what\u2019s taking place.\"\nA few minutes later, Bynum-Coleman said, \"I think that the police should only be there to make sure the school is safer and secure. They should not have any dealings with disciplinary actions within the school.\"\nRob Silverstein, Bynum-Coleman\u2019s campaign manager, sent us an email calling Cox's ad\u00a0\"incredibly misleading and deceptive, and it presents a clearly false impression of what she said.\"\nParker Slaybaugh, spokesman for Cox, stood by the ad. \"It's pretty hard to be a misrepresentation of Ms. Bynum-Coleman, when the ad uses a recording of her own words,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nCox\u2019s ad says\u00a0\"Sheila Bynum-Coleman said, \u2018We need to get the police out of schools.\u2019\"\nBynum-Coleman used those words in a lengthy answer she gave to a question about the \"prison-to-school pipeline,\" affecting many black students.\u00a0\nBut in her next sentence, she explained that police \"need\" to be on hand \"to make sure the school is safe, not to incarcerate the children and deal with disciplinary actions and that\u2019s what\u2019s taking place.\"\nAnd she elaborated a few minutes later, \"I think that the police should only be there to make sure the school is safe\u00a0and secure. They should not have any dealings with disciplinary actions within the school.\"\nCox ignores this easily available context and, in an era of mass shootings, misleadingly creates the impression that Bynam-Coleman said she would leave schools unprotected.\u00a0\nWe rate Cox\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00037"}
