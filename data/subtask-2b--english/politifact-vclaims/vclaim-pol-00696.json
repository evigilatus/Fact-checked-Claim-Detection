Now, as the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, McConnell is taking government-funded care away from tens of millions of Americans. Let that sink in.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIt is true that McConnell was diagnosed with polio when he was young, as he lays out in his 2016 memoir \"The Long March.\" His treatment was not paid for by the government, but through charitable donations.\nMcConnell was diagnosed with polio in 1944 at the age of 2, nearly 10 years before the polio vaccine was developed. In his memoir, McConnell wrote that he received care in Warm Springs, Ga., at the polio treatment center founded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had suffered from the disease.\nDavid Oshinsky, historian and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \"Polio: An American Story,\" told PolitiFact in an email that no government money was involved in the Warm Springs, Ga., treatment center. It was \"all voluntary private contributions.\"\nThe rumor surfaced on social media in June 2017 as Senate Republicans, led by McConnell, took steps to repeal and replace President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Occupy Democrats Facebook page posted the meme with an accompanying article that reported government-sponsored public funds saved McConnell\u2019s life, several outlets reported at the time.\nThat story, which appeared on the Occupy Democrats website, has since been deleted. We\u00a0tracked down a snapshot of the article using the web archive tool Wayback Machine.\nAnother story with similar reporting surfaced the same day on the online magazine Death and Taxes.\nBoth falsely claim that McConnell\u2019s care and rehabilitation was paid for by the public and, thus, was government-funded. But no federal dollars helped cure McConnell of the disease;\u00a0it was a privately-funded facility.\nIn 1937, Roosevelt re-established the Warm Springs Foundation as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and, in 1938, the foundation launched the first March of Dimes\u00a0fundraiser. Comedian and radio personality Eddie Cantor coined the phrase and helped promote the nationwide March of Dimes campaign that was to line up with the president\u2019s annual birthday ball on Jan. 30.\nCantor and other organizers solicited donations on the radio the month leading up the ball, and by Jan. 29, 1938, the eve of the president\u2019s birthday, \"over 80,000 letters with dimes and dollars flooded the White House mailroom.\" The mailroom was \"literally buried in an avalanche of donations, a total of 2,680,000 dimes or $268,000,\" according to the March of Dimes website.\nFunds also went to research grants to find a cure for the disease. That materialized in the mid 1950s, when Jonas Salk successfully developed the polio vaccine.\nWhile Roosevelt\u2019s political office promoted the fundraising for polio care and research, and the president used his name and popularity to help raise funds, the money came from the charity of the American people, as well as celebrities and corporations.\nThe care McConnell received as a toddler was not taxpayer or government-funded, as the viral meme suggests. The facility operated as a nationwide nonprofit organization.\nWe rate this meme False.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-29 16:06:08 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Mitch McConnell was cured of polio when he was a child by government-funded care and now he\u2019s trying to take that same care away from millions of Americans    Facebook posts on the internet     Monday, April 22, 2019 2019-04-22    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00696"}
