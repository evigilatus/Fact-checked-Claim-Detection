Trey Gowdy\u2019s son found dead in a dumpster", "text": "A tasteless hoax on several blogs says the 8-year-old son of U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., was found dead in a garbage bin in Washington.\nDailyUSAUpdate.com, a known purveyor of bogus news stories, posted a story on May 20, 2017, with the headline, \"Worse than Hitler! Trey Gowdy\u2019s son found in a Dumpster in D.C.! Murders are being questioned!\"\nFacebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.\nThe fake article said that Terrence Vaughan Martin Gowdy was found dead in a Washington dumpster.\nRife with misspellings and grammatical errors, the post said the boy had disappeared from the Capitol building and was found in the trash receptacle at a Trump-owned hotel, possibly in an attempt to frame the president. It said two suspects named Hamil Lalahafa and Sanjay Gemtrapa were being questioned.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was no contact information listed on DailyUSAUpdate.com. The fabrication has been published in various forms on other websites, too. None of them seem very concerned with the fact that Gowdy\u2019s two children are named Abigail and Watson. There also are no mainstream news accounts of anything happening to the chairman of the House Benghazi committee\u2019s kids.\nThe story first\u00a0appeared May 20 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a well-known purveyor of fabricated news stories. The site\u2019s goal is to goad conservative readers into believing fake posts in an attempt to illustrate their gullibility.\n\"We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist,\" the site\u2019s About Us disclaimer reads. \"Names that represent actual people and places are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and do not in any way depict reality.\"\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org\u2019s fake saga went on to say the suspects (whose names had changed) had escaped from U.S. Marshals and implied a link to the boy\u2019s death to Hillary Clinton.\nThere\u2019s no evidence that anything actually happened to Gowdy\u2019s real children, so that\u2019s a plus. This story, however, is another creation of the fake news cycle.\nWe rate it Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-05-26 17:12:11 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says U.S. Rep.
