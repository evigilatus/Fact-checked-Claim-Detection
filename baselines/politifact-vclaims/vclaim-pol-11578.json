Or is there more to the study?\n\nAsked for backup, Neumann campaign spokesman Chris Lato showed us that in January 2011, the National Institutes of Health awarded a $175,587 grant to a University of Kentucky psychology professor for an \"enhancement of sexual motivaton\" project.\n\nIndeed, the sex habits of Japanese quail on cocaine were to be observed.\n\nSo, Neumann is correct on the cost and the basic set-up of the study.\n\nLato also cited an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning news web site. The article pointed out that the project is actually a five-year study and it quoted a university official defending it.\n\nQuail watching\n\nThe grant information shows the government launched the project with a $181,406 award in January 2010. It added the $175,587 cited by Neumann in 2011 and another $175,211 in February 2012. The study is slated to continue through January 2015.\n\nThe grant document explains why Japanese quail were chosen and how the study relates to humans:\n\n\"The goal of the proposed experiments is to utilize an animal model whose sexual behavior system has been well-studied, Japanese quail. In addition to the benefits of using quail to study sexual behavior, the use of a visually-oriented species in studying drug effects may be of additional relevance to studying human drug addiction.\n\n\"We currently have preliminary evidence in male Japanese quail that pre-exposure to cocaine enhances sexual motivation. This finding ties in well with clinical observations that indicate that cocaine use in humans may increase sexual motivation, thereby increasing the likelihood of the occurrence of high-risk sexual behavior,\" such as unprotected sex and increased number of sexual partners.\n\nThe Daily Caller article provided by Neumann\u2019s campaign noted that James Tracy, the vice president for research at the University of Kentucky, defended the study.\n\n\"Why Japanese quail? Cocaine abuse in humans has been shown clinically that it leads to risky sexual behavior, they have more sexual partners, and that leads to more sexually transmitted diseases,\" Tracy told a Kentucky TV station.\n\n\"It's important to look what is behind the title (of the study). You are limited to only 64 characters\" in applying for the federal grant, he said.\n\nAlso backing the study is chronobiologist Bora Zivkovic, blog editor of Scientific American, which describes itself as the \"leading source and authority for science, technology information and policy for a general audience.\"\n\nZivkovic said in the magazine he spent 10 years studying the Japanese quail and that the bird has been used in laboratory research since at least 1914.\n\n\"Studying effects of cocaine on reproductive behavior is so much more efficient in a species in which we do not have to start from scratch \u2013 we already know so much about its brain, behavior and reproduction, we can move on to more sophisticated studies than just the first exploratory \u2018basic experiments.\u2019 Thus we can make faster progress. This is an efficient approach,\" Zivkovic wrote.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a good use of tax money to do more study on quail and sex and cocaine isn\u2019t a question we\u2019re here to settle.\n\nBut the study Neumann cited isn\u2019t intended merely to learn about birds, but about drug abuse and sexual habits of humans that can lead to public health problems.\n\nOur rating\n\nNeumann said he could save $175,587 by eliminating a study of the \"connection between cocaine and risky sex habits of the Japanese quail.\" A grant for that amount was awarded for such a study in 2011, another was made in 2012 and more are slated to be made.\n\nBut the scope of the study is much larger than what Neumann suggests by citing only the title.\n\nNeumann\u2019s claim was accurate, but needed additional information. We don\u2019t know how Leno or Letterman would rule, but that\u2019s our definition of Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11578"}
