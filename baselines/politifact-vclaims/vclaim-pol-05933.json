Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on his Sept. 21 show regarding the legacy of President Ronald Reagan.\nColbert asked Cruz, who\u2019s running for the Republican presidential nomination, whether he could agree with Reagan\u2019s support of \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants and the late president\u2019s willingness to raise some taxes amid budget shortfalls.\nCruz said \"of course not\" before pivoting to Reagan\u2019s most conservative accomplishments, one being that he \"signed the largest tax cut in history\" and spurred economic growth.\n\"When (Ronald) Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year,\" Cruz said. \"There\u2019s only one other four-year period where that\u2019s true. That\u2019s true from 2008 to 2012.\"\nHis point was that Reagan rescued the U.S. economy from the ravages it suffered under his Democratic predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, and that the only other equivalent economic distress occurred under Carter\u2019s fellow Democrat, Barack Obama.\nColbert responded, \"But when conditions changed in the country, he reversed his world\u2019s \u2018largest tax cut\u2019 and raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations. So it\u2019s a matter of compromising.\"\nWe wondered if Cruz was correct about the periods of low GDP growth. (In a separate fact-check, we explore Colbert\u2019s rejoinder.)\nExcepting the unusual post-World War II period of 1945 through 1949 -- when the nation was demobilizing from an all-encompassing war -- Cruz has put his finger correctly on the two general periods in which the annual average growth of gross domestic product over four-year periods has sunk below 1 percent. They are the late 1970s era of \"stagflation\" (that is, stagnant growth combined with rapid inflation) and the aftermath of the Great Recession. The full annual data can be found here.\nBut there were actually three distinct four-year periods during and after the Great Recession that fit Cruz\u2019s criteria, rather than one -- that is, the four-year periods starting with 2006, 2007 and 2008. (With every four-year period beginning after 2009, average annual GDP growth has exceeded 1 percent.)\nHere\u2019s the rundown of the four post-World War II periods that fit Cruz\u2019s criteria:\n\n\n\n\nFirst year\n\n\nSecond year\n\n\nThird year\n\n\nFourth year\n\n\nAverage annual GDP growth\n\n\n\n\n1979\n\n\n1980\n\n\n1981\n\n\n1982\n\n\n0.2 percent\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n2007\n\n\n2008\n\n\n2009\n\n\n0.3 percent\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

Also, the implication of his comment -- that Democrats bear the primary responsibility for these periods of poor economic growth -- is not so clear.\nFor starters, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, economists say it\u2019s hard to determine how much credit or blame a president deserves for successes or shortcomings in the economy at large on their watch. Factors outside their control, from energy-price shocks to technological changes to pure luck, can have a significant impact on the nation\u2019s economic record.\nIn addition, Cruz\u2019s groupings suggest some contradictory standard-setting.\nFor the 1979-1982 period, Carter was in office for the first two years and Reagan was in office for the third and fourth years.\nBut in the next two periods -- 2006-2009 and\u00a0 2007-2010 -- George W. Bush, a Republican, was president for at least half of the time. In fact, Bush was in charge for the first three years in 2006-2009, and the first two years in 2007-2010.\nIf Carter, Democrat, is to take blame for the slow growth in the first period, then logically Bush, a Republican, should shoulder the same blame in the next two four-year periods.\nBy the same token, if Reagan, a Republican, escapes blame in the first example, then so too should Obama in the second and third four-year periods.\nAnd the 2005-2008 period --\u00a0which occurred entirely on Bush\u2019s watch -- barely escapes inclusion on this list, with an average annual growth rate of 1.13 percent. (During the 2008-2011 period,\u00a0Obama\u00a0was president for the final three of those years.)\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, said he doesn\u2019t blame either Reagan or Obama for the economic shortcomings early in their tenures that fall under Cruz\u2019s statistical claim. Still, he sees a logical inconsistency in Cruz\u2019s comparison as stated on Colbert\u2019s show.\n\"It seems doubtful whether poor economic performance early in any president's term can be attributed to the impact of his administration's policies,\" Burtless said. \"If you take office when economic output is plunging, it does not seem legitimate to attribute the economic plunge to the person who just took office.\"\nHe added a footnote: Unlike Obama, who unquestionably inherited a recession already under way, the economy actually grew through the first couple of months of Reagan\u2019s first term. GDP grew in the third and fourth quarters of 1980, right before he was elected, and continued to grow during the first quarter of 1981 after he was in office, before a \"double-dip\" recession hit.\nCruz spokesman Phil Novack told PolitiFact that our analysis misses the point.\n\"The focus on who exactly held office in each of those individual time periods is not as important as the contrast between the two periods in terms of how quickly the economy was growing before and after those identified time periods, which is the point Cruz was making,\" Novack said. \"His point was obviously referring to policy results, and we know the results of the policies that followed those slow-growth years of below 1 percent growth that Sen. Cruz identified. Reagan's policies brought us a boom, and Obama's policies have been a bust.\"\nFor what it\u2019s worth, we also compared Carter and Reagan on their economic records and found them more similar than one might expect.\nDuring Carter\u2019s four years in office, the growth rate averaged 3.23 percent a year. If you take the first four years of Reagan\u2019s presidency, it averaged 3.34 percent. Essentially, each president had two good years and two bad years, which more or less averaged out.\nOur ruling\nCruz said that \"when (Ronald) Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year. There\u2019s only one other four-year period where that\u2019s true. That\u2019s true from 2008 to 2012.\"\nCruz missed\u00a0two other four-year periods that fit the criteria. In addition, his implication -- that Democrats are largely to blame for those conditions -- doesn\u2019t stand up to logical consistency, particularly when he excluded the period beginning in 2006 (which included three years solely under Bush) and 2007 (which included two years solely under Bush).\nThis goes on top of general uncertainty about how much blame to assign presidents for poor economic conditions. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05933"}
