Tillerson\u2019s lawyer also told the Wall Street Journal that Tillerson himself cared the most about property devaluation. And the oil chief dropped out of the lawsuit after receiving attention for it.\nIn 2012, Tillerson, his wife and their neighbors in Bartonville, Texas, sued to block the construction of a 160-foot water tower in their luxury community. The tower would, in part, supply water for hydraulic fracturing \u2014 which injects pressurized water as well as sand and chemicals under shale rock formations to extract natural gas. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe lawsuit contended the project violates the town\u2019s zoning ordinance and will also be an \"unbearable nuisance.\"\n\"A water tower will have lights on at all hours of the night, traffic to and from the tower at unknown and unreasonable hours, noise from mechanical and electrical equipment needed to maintain and operate the water tower, and creates and (sic) unsafe and unattractive nuisance to the children of the area,\" the suit reads.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Furthermore, upon information and belief, (the Bartonville Water Supply Corporation) will sell water to oil and gas explorers for fracing shale formations leading to traffic with heavy trucks on FM 407, creating a noise nuisance and traffic hazards,\" it continues.\nIn addition to joining the lawsuit, Tillerson sat for a three-hour deposition in May 2013 and protested the project at a town council meeting that November, according to the Journal\u2019s report in February 2014. But the newspaper noted that Tillerson wasn\u2019t \"the most vocal or well-known opponent of the tower.\" That distinction belonged to the lead plaintiffs, former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey and his wife.\nEnvironmentalists jumped on the story, with plenty pointing out the irony and hypocrisy but embracing Tillerson into their ranks.\nA former oil executive penned an open letter to Tillerson on NoFrackingWay.Us decrying the environmental impacts of the practice and wishing him \"good luck with that fracking water tank.\" Credo Action, an online hub of progressive activists, dubbed Tillerson \"the highest-profile anti-fracking activist in the world.\" And MoveOn.org offered Tillerson its \"FrackingFighter\" award.\nUnder pressure and after a judge dismissed the claims, Tillerson dropped out of the lawsuit two months later in April 2014, the Dallas Business Journal reported. The Armeys and a few others continued to pursue legal action over the project, and the battle continued into at least November 2015, the last mention of the case we could find.\nOur ruling\nFood & Water Watch said Tillerson \"sued to keep a fracking project out of his backyard.\"\nTillerson joined a lawsuit that listed noise nuisance and traffic hazards among the plaintiffs\u2019 many concerns, though he later dropped out of the litigation.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03872"}
