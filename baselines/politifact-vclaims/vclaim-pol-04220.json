Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Koster campaign also directed us to an article from the Springfield News-Leader.\n\n\nWhat we found in examining the evidence is that not every hospital Koster cited is \"rural,\" and the hospitals closed for a variety of reasons.\n\n\nCecil G. Sheps Center Report\n\n\nThe Sheps Center has tracked hospital closings in the continental United States since 2010. In that amount of time, three rural Missouri hospitals have closed, the center reports.\n\n\nThe Sac-Osage Hospital in Osceola closed in September 2014, the Parkland Health Center Weber Road in Farmington closed in January, and the SoutheastHEALTH Center of Reynolds County in Ellington closed in March.\n\n\nKoster\u2019s campaign also directed our attention to the Ozarks Community Hospital in Springfield, which closed its surgery department and emergency room in July. The Ozarks Community Hospital is not considered a rural hospital because it\u2019s located in Springfield, population 160,000. The hospital contained 45 beds, plus 10 more in its geriatric psychiatry unit, a small number for a city of that size.\n\n\nIf we start counting in September of 2014, these four closings work out to approximately one every eight months. But, again, while the Ozarks Community Hospital is small, it\u2019s not rural.\n\n\nMedicaid\n\n\nAccording to Ryan Barker at the Missouri Foundation for Health, Missouri could have expanded Medicaid starting Jan. 1, 2014, before any of the hospitals closed. Expanding Medicaid would have had a significant impact on the reimbursement of health care providers. Dave Dillon, a spokesman for the Missouri Hospital Association, told St. Louis Public Radio that the legislature\u2019s decision to not expand Medicaid will cost Missouri $4 billion in federal payments over the next six years.\n\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, states were given the opportunity to expand the pool of citizens covered by Medicaid, a subsidized insurance for citizens living in poverty. The federal government would have covered the entire costs of the broadened coverage for the first three years, but the level of federal subsidy would decline after that.\n\n\nLegislators in Missouri and 18 other states chose not to expand Medicaid, in part because of the greater costs to the state, but also because of ideological opposition to subsidized insurance and Obamacare.\n\n\nSince many rural hospitals were already in crisis before 2014 because of a large burden of uninsured patients, the failure to expand Medicaid isn\u2019t the direct cause for closings. However, Medicaid expansion was a missed opportunity to lessen the load on those affected hospitals.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaleb Rowden\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2017 in a statement at a legislative breakfast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And this would be the first year, if everything holds true, we will spend over $10 billion of our state budget on Medicaid out of the $28 billion budget.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Austin Hough \u2022 March 12, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the hospitals closed\n\n\nIn an article from the Kansas Health Institute News Service, Chris Smiley, the CEO of the Sac-Osage hospital, said the hospital was forced to close because of a large amount of uninsured patients and shrinking payments from Medicare.\n\n\n\"Hospitals expected to see millions of newly insured customers thanks to federal subsidies enabling people to buy health insurance and the expansion of state Medicaid programs,\" explained the article. \"In exchange, they agreed to accept reduced Medicare payments and a huge cut in disproportionate share hospital, or DSH, funding, which the federal government pays to offset the costs of uncompensated care.\"\n\n\nSince Missouri opted out of Medicaid expansion, this left the hospital with a gap in reimbursement.\n\n\nThe closest hospital to Osceola is now Ellett Memorial Hospital in Appleton City, 30 minutes away.\n\n\nParkland Health Center Weber Road officials were much less specific in their explanation, but said that concerns about building safety and regulations factored in the decision to close.\n\n\nMost of the hospital\u2019s services, including emergency care, have since been relocated to other Parkland Health facilities, also located in Farmington.\n\n\nSoutheastHEALTH was forced to close because of a $6 million debt owed by Advanced Healthcare, the previous owner of the hospital. As the owners of the property, state Medicaid officials informed the company that it was liable for the debt.\n\n\nThe nearest hospital to Ellington is now the Iron County Hospital in Pilot Knob.\n\n\nOzarks Community Hospital was forced to close its ER and surgery center because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determined it did not have a large enough inpatient population to be considered a hospital.\n\n\nSince approximately 40 percent of the hospital\u2019s patients were uninsured and it was being paid less money to treat them, the hospital was only able to admit patients following surgery by 2015, according to OCH Health System owner and CEO Paul Taylor in a Springfield News-Leader article.\n\n\nHe said there is \"no doubt in my mind\" that the hospital would have stayed open if Missouri had expanded Medicaid.\n\n\nThe Ozarks Community Hospital now functions as a clinic.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nKoster said, \"A rural hospital in Missouri closes every 8 months. The legislature\u2019s failure to expand Medicaid has brought crisis to many of Missouri\u2019s rural health care providers.\"\n\n\nKoster\u2019s claim is a bit of stretch. Four small Missouri hospitals have closed entirely or in part since September 2014, three of which are rural. In half those cases, patients being unable to pay their bills was cited as a reason for the closure. And many of those patients likely would have been covered had Missouri expanded Medicaid.\nKoster\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.\u00a0We rate it Half True.\n\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/777d846a-33b3-42b6-8f88-49d665f6fe6a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04220"}
