Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees must offer health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 Health insurance exchanges. The plan involves the use of voluntary \"exchanges\" through which individuals and small businesses may purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 Affordability subsidies. Lower-income individuals and families receive government subsidies to help pay their health insurance premiums. Subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 Expansion of Medicaid. The plan expands Medicaid to all children whose families earn up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 Insurance market regulation. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 may be covered on their parents' plan.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe think Santorum\u2019s use of the label \"top-down\" reflects his political opposition to both the Massachusetts plan and the national plan modeled after it. Given that opposition, a person could consider an individual mandate a \"top-down\" approach to health care, although others would disagree.\n\nBut \"government-run?\" That characterization is simply wrong.\n\nWe asked Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, to explain:\n\n\"The Massachusetts plan leaves private health insurance intact, and under the Massachusetts plan, health care delivery remains predominantly in private hands, as it was before the law was enacted,\" he wrote in an email.\n\n\"The role of government is expanded, but that is not the same as saying the government \u2018runs\u2019 the health system. The Massachusetts plan expanded Medicaid, but at the same time it expanded uninsured residents\u2019 access to private insurance (through subsidies to buy coverage and the connector).\"\n\nWhat does an actual government-run system look like? Oberlander pointed to the truly socialized system of Great Britain -- as well as to one in our own backyard.\n\n\"The Massachusetts plan ... looks NOTHING like a true \u2018government-run health care system... \u00a0the VA\u2019s health system where the government owns the hospitals and employs doctors directly,\" he said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSantorum called Romney\u2019s health law \"a top-down, government-run health care system.\"\n\n\u00a0 The individual mandate and the requirement that employers offer health insurance might be considered top-down, though it is still a system that relies heavily on private insurance and private medical providers. But there\u2019s no case to for calling it \"government-run.\"\u00a0 A real government-run system has doctors on the payroll. Massachusetts does not. We rate Santorum\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11699"}
