House members file expenditure reports for all official foreign travel with the House clerk\u2019s office. We searched reports for the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 and found no trips by Pelosi to China. (Pelosi traveled to Jordan and Afghanistan in October, Spain in December and Luxembourg and Belgium in December. She visited Poland and Israel in January and Germany and Belgium in February.)\nPelosi\u2019s spokesman said her last visit to China was in November 2015 when she visited Beijing. The U.S. delegation and Chinese officials discussed climate change, protection of cyberspace, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, human and women\u2019s rights, and other topics, according to a press release from Pelosi\u2019s office.\nOther false Facebook posts have included a photo of Pelosi shaking the hand of a Chinese official. Snopes and USA Today found that the photo was from Pelosi\u2019s visit in November 2015 when she met with Chinese politician Zhang Dejiang, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.\nRELATED: All of our fact-checks of or about Pelosi\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said that Pelosi was in Wuhan, China, \"6 days after the impeachment HOAX failed.\"\nTravel records last show Pelosi in China in 2015.
