Bruce Rauner called some Chicago Public Schools \"crumbling prisons,\" and then five-year-old emails from when he was in private business revealed he\u2019d also called principals \"managerially incompetent\" and half its teachers \"virtually illiterate.\" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could not let the moment pass, even as he said he was accepting Rauner\u2019s apology for the remarks.\nAt a press event after Rauner\u2019s email comments were released, Emanuel used the opportunity to boast about CPS students\u2019 achievements. \"Well, let me tell you what the [Chicago Public Schools] \u2018crumbling prisons\u2019 with wardens as principals and guards as teachers have done. They lead the country in high school graduation of an urban school system\u2026They now match the United States of America in kids graduating high school going on to a four-year college...That same prison with that same warden and that same security guard is also producing eighth-grade leaders in the country in math gains, fourth-grade leaders in reading gains.\"\nThat\u2019s a lot to study, so we decided to do our homework.\nTesting the claims\nLauren Huffman, a spokeswoman for the mayor\u2019s office, noted Emanuel often repeats those claims, citing statistics from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The NAEP calls itself the largest, continuing organization that tests students in a variety of subjects. It is under the umbrella of the National Center for Education Statistics run by the federal education department.\nWe were able to verify the mayor\u2019s claims about eighth-grade math and fourth-grade reading by examining \"The Nation\u2019s Report Card\" for 2016 and the Trial Urban District Assessment published by the NAEP, and by interviewing Grady Wilburn, a statistician with the National Center for Education Statistics.\nWilburn said Chicago\u2019s fourth-grade reading score had improved 15 points since 2003, the second-highest improvement behind Washington, D.C., which improved 26 points. Since 2013, Chicago improved 7 percentage points and tied for first place with Washington, Cleveland and Boston.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWhile the chart shows numerically that D.C. is higher, it does not account for statistical significance. Wilburn said when districts are tested for statistical significance, Washington, Cleveland and Chicago are not different from each other. Significance testing considers sampling error associated with only assessing a portion of students, not all of them.\nIn eighth-grade reading, Wilburn said scores show Emanuel\u2019s statement to be accurate.\nSince 2003, he said, eighth-grade CPS math scores have improved 20 percentage points. They are statistically tied for highest gains since 2003. They\u2019re tied with Atlanta, Boston and Los Angeles.\nIf you look just at 2013-15, Chicago\u2019s scores went up 6 percentage points, and that is the biggest gain. Of the 21 urban districts monitored, CPS students were the only ones to improve in eighth-grade math from 2013 to 2015.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing or surpassing?\nEmanuel made two other claims about Chicago Public School students. One of the claims was that they now match the nation in kids graduating high school and going on to a four-year college.\nThe Chicago Consortium on School Research at the University of Chicago published a new study in June that examined high school graduation, college enrollment and bachelor\u2019s degree attainment rates.\nChicago Public Schools\u2019 \"four-year college enrollment rate for 2014 is 42 percent, two percentage points lower than the national rate, and half of CPS graduates who enroll in four-year colleges will graduate in six years,\" a summary of the report says.\nTwo percentage points lower than the nation in college enrollment would indicate Emanuel\u2019s statement is slightly off, but it is clear CPS graduation rates, college enrollment and degree attainment have been rising significantly. In 2006, the graduation and college enrollment rate was eight percent. In nine years, by 2015, that rate had doubled to 16 percent.\nEmanuel\u2019s other claim, that CPS leads the nation among urban districts for high school graduation, was more difficult to verify. The National Center for Education Statistics put the adjusted cohort graduation rate at 82 percent for 2013-14. Jenny Nagaoka, deputy director of the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research and an author of the study of CPS college attainment, said the CPS rate for the same year is 74 percent, but she cautioned the two institutions might rely on districts that calculate rates differently.\nUnlike reading and math scores, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a comparison of urban district graduation rates. In 2012, she said CPS was \"probably in the middle of the pack\" nationally.\n\"On the basis of this, I can\u2019t conclusively say this is a true or false statement,\" she said. \"CPS is certainly higher than Baltimore. We may be higher than New York. CPS is certainly higher than many. Chicago has made great gains. We\u2019ve really closed the gap compared to the national rate and that\u2019s important.\"\nChicago\u2019s improvement in graduation rate comes at a time when, nationally the rate also has been climbing. \"It is a big accomplishment to improve the gap when the national rate also is improving,\" Nagaoka said.\nOur ruling\nEmanuel\u2019s boasts about reading and math scores compared to other urban districts were accurate. His statement about going on to four-year college was a bit off, but probably not statistically significant. We could not find data to conclusively verify that CPS leads urban districts nationwide in its graduation rate, but it has made dramatic improvement.\nA similar study from the consortium concludes, \"While changes in student demographics account for some of the increase in graduation rates, improvements in student performance in high school \u2014 compared to similar students who started high school in the past \u2014 accounts for most of the change; students are passing more classes and earning more credits in ninth grade. Not only are more students graduating, but they are leaving high school with higher achievement than graduates in prior years.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/63a534ae-e972-481b-a873-1a398ba7c69f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04418"}
