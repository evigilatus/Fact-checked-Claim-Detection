David N. Cicilline, was criticized for leaving the city in poor financial shape and draining reserve funds to balance his last city budget.\n\nCicilline denied that he had masked an emerging financial crisis in Providence and he defended his accomplishments during his eight years as mayor, saying that, \"When I took office in 2003, we had very little reserves, and we worked very hard to build up our reserves.\"\n\nWe decided to take a look. We began by asking Cicilline\u2019s communications director, Jessica Kershaw, to provide the basis for the former mayor\u2019s statement.\n\nIn reply, Cicilline\u2019s congressional office issued a statement saying: \"When referring to the unreserved fund balance, or rainy day fund, as the attached Comprehensive Annual Financial Report shows, in 2003, when Cicilline took office as mayor, there was $10 million, and the Cicilline administration more than doubled that by building it up to $22 million by 2008.\"\n\nAttached to the statement was a page from the city\u2019s audited financial statement for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010. That page shows Providence had an \"unreserved\" general fund balance of $10.2 million at the end of fiscal year 2003. That total rose to a high of $22.36 million at the end of fiscal year 2008, but it plunged to $2.08 million at the end of fiscal year 2010.\n\nSo does $10.2 million represent \"very little reserves\"? Well, at that time $10.2 million was just under 3 percent of the city\u2019s $345 million in actual general operating spending for 2003.\n\nCertainly, that\u2019s not nearly as much as the $22.36 million in unreserved fund balance that the Cicilline administration had accumulated by fiscal year 2008 -- about 5 percent of the city\u2019s actual spending that year.\n\nBut it\u2019s a whole lot more than the $2.08 million that the Cicilline administration had left by the end of fiscal year 2010 -- about 0.5 percent of the actual spending.\n\nAnd it looks really good in comparison with the $220,814 that remained in those reserves as of March 11.\n\nBut what is the standard for determining whether a city\u2019s rainy day fund is sufficient? Public finance literature often focuses on a 5 percent standard. And this year, the Government Finance Officers Association executive board is recommending revised \"best practices\" that call for the equivalent of two months -- or 16.6 percent -- of annual spending.\n\nWith that in mind, did Cicilline have \"very little reserves\" when he had $10.2 million, or about 3 percent?\n\nGary S. Sasse, the former Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council director and state revenue director who is now financial adviser to the Providence City Council, said, \"I would say 3 percent is marginal reserves. It doesn\u2019t meet the requirement of 5 percent. But it\u2019s better than nothing. It\u2019s better than we have right now.\"\n\nCity Treasurer James J. Lombardi III, a critic of Cicilline\u2019s financial practices, said that while the 2003 unreserved fund balance fell below \u00a0the 5 percent threshold, that doesn\u2019t mean Providence had \"very little\" reserves at the time. \"Clearly, it was a lot more than we have today,\" he said.\n\nPlus, the Cicilline administration had other restricted contingency accounts as a cushion, Lombardi said. And in 2003, the city\u2019s assets included the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Center, which it later sold. Now, the city has slashed its unreserved general fund balance, depleted restricted contingency accounts and borrowed at least $60 million to balance the budget, he said.\n\nCicilline has defended his decision to use reserve funds and to borrow money to balance budgets, saying those actions were better than cutting city services and significantly raising taxes. \"It was a judgment that I made that that was the best way to navigate through the worst economy since the Great Depression,\" he said.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nCertainly, it\u2019s true that when Cicilline took office, the unreserved fund balance did not meet the often-cited 5 percent threshold and it fell well short of the 16.6-percent goal that a professional group now recommends.\n\nBut it\u2019s a stretch for the former mayor to characterize the $10.2 million he had in 2003 \u00a0as \"very little.\" After all, that\u2019s almost five times what was in the reserve fund in his last year in office.\n\nGiven municipal finance standards, there is an element of truth in Cicilline\u2019s claim, but his statement ignores critical facts that would give a much different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, that is the definition of \"Barely True.\"\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Doughty\n\n\nstated on June 12, 2011 in an appearance on WPRI's \"Newsmakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Providence is one of the busiest fire departments for its relative size in the country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy C.
