Glenn Grothman was known for making provocative comments, such as: Homosexuality should not be discussed in sex education classes and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday is \"an insult\" to taxpayers.\nGrothman\u2019s remarks have gotten less attention since he was elected in 2014 to a House seat in east-central Wisconsin that has been safely Republican for decades.\nSo, it was a surprise when Grothman, who is seeking a third House term in 2018, said he is facing the toughest race of his political career against Democrat Dan Kohl. Kohl himself isn\u2019t well known, though he is the nephew of multimillionaire and former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis.\nA mantra of Kohl\u2019s campaign -- that Grothman \"is the single-most partisan member of the House\" --\u00a0 is something we want to check.\nThe charge (sometimes with the word Congress instead of House) appeared as recently as Nov. 7, 2017\u00a0on Kohl\u2019s campaign Facebook page. And it is one he has made repeatedly, including on TV, on Twitter, in a campaign video and in his campaign announcement.\nAs we\u2019ll see, there\u2019s a solid source to back up the claim. But its data is nearly a year old and it acknowledges it uses only one way to measure partisanship.\nOne ranking\nThe latest Bipartisan Index ranked Grothman as the second-most partisan House member, ahead of only Kansas Republican Tim Huelskamp.\nKohl argues that Grothman is currently the most-partisan because Huelskamp, who lost his run for re-election in 2016, is no longer in the House.\nBut the rankings are for the 114th Congress, which covers Grothman\u2019s first two-year term in the House (2015-\u201916). They don\u2019t take into account any activity since 2016, including any new member now in a first term.\nThe rankings are done by the Lugar Center, a think tank formed by Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican who served in the U.S. Senate from 1977 to 2013; and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. The rankings have been reported on by Politico, The Hill, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Roll Call and other media that cover Congress.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe index measures bipartisanship in two ways -- the frequency with which members of Congress sponsor bills that include at least one co-sponsor from the opposing party and co-sponsor bills introduced by members of the opposing party.\nAs the Journal Sentinel has reported, it\u2019s just one of many ways to define bipartisanship, but it\u2019s a concrete, quantifiable measure of the effort members make at the front end of the legislative process to work across party lines.\nAccording to the Bipartisan Index, during the 2015-\u201916 session, Grothman sponsored eight qualifying bills, none of which gained a single Democrat co-sponsor; and co-sponsored 276 qualifying bills, only nine of which were introduced by a Democrat.\nOther measures\nGrothman\u2019s House office noted that GovTrack.us, which tracks Congress, also does bipartisanship rankings.\nWe found two for House members for the 2015-\u201916 session, though each is less comprehensive than the Bipartisan Index. One had the same finding as the Bipartisan Index -- that Grothman did not introduce any bill that had a Democratic cosponsor. For the percentage of bills cosponsored by each legislator that were introduced by a member of the other party,\u00a0Grothman ranked fifth from the bottom.\n\nGrothman's office also cited to us a number of Grothman\u2019s bipartisan actions, all during 2017, including: Grothman expressing disagreement with fellow Republicans over legislation; working with U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, on legislation for refinancing student loans; and co-sponsoring a GOP-sponsored bill, also supported by Democrats, to legalize hemp.\nOur rating\nKohl says Grothman\u00a0\"is the single-most partisan member of the House.\"\nOne widely noted index ranked Grothman as the second-most partisan member during the 2015-\u201916 congressional session, above only a member who is no longer in the House. That arguably makes Grothman the most-partisan currently.\nBut the index is only one way of defining partisanship, and it doesn\u2019t account for any House member activity after 2016.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.\ndiv class='artembed'> Share the Facts 2017-11-08 17:39:03 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says Glenn Grothman \"is the single-most partisan member of the House.\"     Dan Kohl Democratic candidate, U.S. House https://www.facebook.com/pg/DanKohlWI/about/?ref=page_internal   On Facebook Tuesday, November 7, 2017 2017-11-07    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02711"}
