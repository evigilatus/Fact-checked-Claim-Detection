(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It\u2019s similar to other claims we\u2019ve seen on Facebook, so we wanted to check it out.\nSome Democratic caucus members omitted \"one nation under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance during DNC meetings. But the line was not excluded from any of the convention\u2019s primetime televised spots. On each night of the DNC, \"under God\" was included in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nConservative news outlets like the Washington Examiner have pointed out that, during the livestreamed Muslim Delegates Assembly on Aug. 18, one participant omitted \"under God\" from the Pledge. A delegate at an Aug. 18 LGBTQ Caucus meeting also abstained from saying it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were 30 caucus and council meetings during the DNC, according to the party\u2019s website. They were not the scripted, highly produced sessions that aired on television.\nThe Pledge of Allegiance has existed in some form since the late 19th century, but in 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a bill that officially added the words \"under God.\" There is a long history of legal challenges and religious objections to the inclusion of the phrase, particularly in public schools, where students are often asked to say the pledge.\nWe reached out to Hubbard for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nHer Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\nCorrection, Aug. 24, 2020: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that, on the first night of the DNC, participants sang the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" instead of saying the Pledge of Allegiance. In fact, the pledge was included on the first night.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17159"}
