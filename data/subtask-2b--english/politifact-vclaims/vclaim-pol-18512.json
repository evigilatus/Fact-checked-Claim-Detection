Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2020 \nBut there is no proof that 9,000 people cast illegal ballots in Nevada after moving out of state, and there remains no evidence of any widespread voter fraud in Nevada or elsewhere.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden led Trump by more than 36,000 votes in Nevada as of this writing.\u00a0\nSchlapp\u2019s claim is derived from a Trump campaign list\nSchlapp\u2019s 9,000 number derives in part from another unproven claim from the Trump campaign and Republicans in Nevada, who argued days earlier that there were 3,062 instances of voter fraud stemming from cases in which people moved out of Nevada but still voted in the state.\nTrump campaign attorneys sent U.S. Attorney General William Barr a list of 3,062 unnamed individuals who they claimed voted in Nevada after moving out of state. A recent lawsuit also referenced \"over 3,000 instances of ineligible individuals casting ballots.\"\nThe campaign\u2019s list showed ZIP codes for voters\u2019 current and previous addresses, but it left out other personally identifying information. The lawyers said they formed it by cross-referencing the list of general election voters in Nevada with publicly available change-of-address records.\nBut the list alone did not prove that anyone had violated the law, as we reported.\nThat\u2019s because people who move within 30 days before an election can legally cast a ballot in their new state \u2014 or in their prior state of residence \u2014 in-person or via absentee ballot. Nevadans who leave the state to attend college or other reasons can also request a ballot.\u00a0\nThe list from Trump\u2019s lawyers also included addresses for Americans serving overseas in the military and their spouses, including some people who have since spoken out.\u00a0\nThe ACLU of Nevada said the list showed changes of address for people who moved to military bases, including at least 129 Army or Air Post Office addresses, 13 Fleet Post Offices and 15 Diplomatic Post Offices, according to the Wall Street Journal. There are other addresses on the list, the Journal reported, that the ACLU said are located in cities near military hubs.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This list they\u2019re talking about has been debunked as having, for example, having military personnel on there who are serving overseas and have the right to vote,\" Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, said on Fox News Nov. 7. \"It could include Mormon missionaries on that list. It could also include college students on that list.\"\nAny registered voter in Nevada could request to vote by mail in 2020, according to the website for the Nevada secretary of state.\nClark County, which includes Las Vegas and nearly 75% of Nevada\u2019s population, has so far referred just three cases of potential fraud to the Nevada secretary of state\u2019s office, said county spokesperson Dan Kulin. None of the three cases involved an ineligible voter from out of state.\n\nA county election worker scans mail-in ballots at a tabulating area as an observer watches at the Clark County Election Department on Nov. 5, 2020, in Las Vegas. (AP)\nSchlapp does not have hard evidence to support his claim\nHow did Schlapp get from the campaign\u2019s list of 3,062 out-of-state voters to 9,000?\u00a0\nHis number relies on back-of-the-envelope math and some major assumptions, including the assumption that everyone who mailed in a ballot was ineligible to do so. There are no signs of a new, bigger list that includes 9,000 changes of address or voter names.\nAn American Conservative Union spokesperson said Schlapp had projected that the number of people who illegally voted from outside Nevada was actually three times as large as the 3,062 people originally alleged. The spokesperson said that\u2019s because only one-third of people report changes of address to the national database maintained by the U.S. Postal Service.\n\"The 3,000 that we came up with, we believe that that is two-thirds shy of the actual number because most people don\u2019t go to the post office to change their address,\" Schlapp said in a Nov. 9 interview with former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.\nBut Martha Johnson, a spokesperson for the Postal Service, said the service was \"unable to confirm\" that only one-third of people report when they change their address. \"The USPS processed approximately 36 million change of addresses\" in 2020, Johnson said.\nSchlapp has not backed his claims up with any hard evidence. Even if 9,000 absentee voters did mail in ballots to Nevada from out of state, there\u2019s no proof any of them did so illegally, as he claimed.\nA spokesperson for Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, declined to comment on Schlapp\u2019s specific claims but pointed to a statement. It said Nevada is investigating all credible allegations of fraud but noted that \"many voter fraud complaints lack any evidence.\"\nNevada law does allow the residency of registered voters to be challenged, including for people who have moved, the Nevada Independent reported. But that law would have required that an affidavit be filed by the challenger with the county clerk in advance of the election.\nOur ruling\nSchlapp claimed that as an example of voter fraud, \"we have literally 9,000 people who voted in this election (in Nevada) who don\u2019t live in Nevada.\"\nSchlapp has acknowledged that his 9,000 figure is not a literal count of illegal out-of-state voters. It is a speculative estimate he came up with based on a list of 3,062 individuals produced by the Trump campaign \u2014 a list that had its own problems.\u00a0\nThe original list included military personnel in its count and did not establish that any of the people it identified were actually ineligible to vote in Nevada. The burden of proof is on the speaker, and Schlapp has provided no credible evidence to substantiate his claim.\u00a0\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18512"}
