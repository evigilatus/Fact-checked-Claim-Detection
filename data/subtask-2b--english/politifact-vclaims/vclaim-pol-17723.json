Melissa Melendez tweeted on Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0\nMelendez, who represents much of Riverside County, went on to argue for a full reopening.\n\"Students should return to school, in person, and all school sports/activities should resume. Let\u2019s stop robbing our kids of the education we owe them. We can do this safely.\"\u00a0\n\nWe won\u2019t put a Truth-O-Meter rating on the second half of her tweet because it\u2019s her opinion. But the first part makes a claim about the facts.\u00a0\nAre there really no COVID-19 studies showing a risk to children?\nWe decided to check that out.\u00a0\u00a0\nOur research\nBenjamin Linas is an associate professor of epidemiology and an infectious disease physician at Boston University School of Medicine. He wrote a recent article in Vox advocating for the reopening of schools this fall.\nBut when asked about Melendez\u2019s claim, he called it \"an oversimplification and untrue.\"\u00a0\n\"There absolutely are studies of COVID-19 risk in children. It is silly to say that kids do not have risk,\" Linas wrote in an email. \"The good news is that medical consensus at this time, based on data, is that children generally have a mild form of COVID and that many are asymptomatic. Overall, if your child contracts COVID, they will be OK. That is good news. But to take that and say that kids are \u2018not at risk\u2019 is an oversimplification and untrue. Some children have died of COVID, some have been in ICUs.\"\nIn his Vox article, Linas pointed to public health reporting that showed children under the age of 18 made up only 2% of coronavirus cases in the United States, even though they represent 22% of the total population.\u00a0\nHe wrote that similar studies in Chicago and Massachusetts found that children make up fewer COVID-19 cases than anticipated, as have studies in Italy, South Korea, and Iceland.\nLooking at data nationally and worldwide at the end of May, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded: \"Based on these early studies, children of all ages are at risk for COVID-19; however, complications of COVID-19 appear to be less common among children compared with adults based on limited reports from China and the U.S.\"\nLee Riley, professor and chair of infectious disease and vaccinology at UC Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health, also disputed Melendez\u2019s claim.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This lawmaker is wrong,\" Riley wrote in an email. \"Though rare, there are well documented cases of severe complications kids develop with COVID-19. In Europe and the US, several cases of Kawasaki-like disease have been reported. (New York City) had about 100 cases with 3 deaths.\"\nRiley is referring to a rare but serious condition found in young people this spring known as Multisystem-Inflammatory Syndrome. Doctors in Europe and the United States have attributed it to complications linked to COVID-19.\u00a0\nWhile the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is low for children, the professor added that \"kids can serve as a reservoir for transmission to their parents and other relatives. Parents who may have diabetes, high blood pressure, and other underlying medical conditions will be at risk for severe complications and even death.\"\nWhen asked about the claim in question, a spokesperson for Sen. Melendez said her tweet was based on statements made at recent White House Coronavirus Task Force events. He acknowledged \"the exact phrasing\" of those statements \"is not the same\" as the senator\u2019s tweet.\nHere\u2019s a sample:\u00a0\n\n\n\"We really don\u2019t have evidence that children are driving the transmission cycle of this,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield stated on Wednesday at the task force briefing.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Children are less likely to become infected and they are less likely to spread infection,\" American Academy of Pediatrics President Sally Goza said at a White House event on Tuesday.\n\n\nThose statements line up with what other health experts have said. But they don\u2019t specifically support Melendez\u2019s broad claim \"There is no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from COVID.\"\u00a0\nA day after Goza\u2019s remarks, White House health advisor Dr. Deborah Birx disputed the idea that children have been proven to be less likely to spread COVID-19, saying there\u2019s not enough data to arrive at that conclusion, CNBC reported.\nLooking at the age groups tested in the United States, \"the lowest tested portion is the under-10-year-olds,\" Birx said Wednesday.\n\"There\u2019s no data one way or the other right now,\" to determine how much children will spread the disease, added UC Berkeley\u2019s Dr. Riley, in a follow-up phone interview.\u00a0\nOur rating\u00a0\nCalifornia State Sen. Melissa Melendez recently claimed there is \"no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from COVID.\"\u00a0\nMedical experts say that\u2019s just plain wrong. There are studies that have examined children and found they are at risk of COVID-19, albeit less risk than adults.\nAs one infectious disease expert put it, some \"children have died of COVID, some have been in ICUs.\"\u00a0\nWhile children aren\u2019t at a high risk for complications of the coronavirus, experts said the data is not yet clear about their role in transmitting it. There\u2019s a tense debate nationally about whether reopening schools will lead to a greater spread of COVID-19 not just among children but also among family members and wider communities.\u00a0\nThat debate is still playing out. What\u2019s clear is that Melendez went too far in her claim, reducing a complicated topic to an oversimplified, unsupported tweet.\u00a0\nWe rate her claim False.\u00a0\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17723"}
