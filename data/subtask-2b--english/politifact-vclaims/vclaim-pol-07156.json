PolitFact Georgia decided to check.\nNunn\u2019s claim is designed to bolster her bipartisan bona fides - and showcase where she agrees with conservatives such as Georgia\u2019s two current senators, Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, and powerful groups, such as the Georgia and American farm bureaus.\nBoth Perdue and Nunn have said they want to serve on the Senate agriculture committee.\nHer claim is based on statements that Perdue made in February, when he was running in the crowded GOP primary. Of the seven Republicans running, only U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Savannah, said he supported the farm bill. \u00a0\nAt the time of that\u00a0 debate, Nunn had already voiced her support for the measure, which took more than two years to pass, as well as her intent to seek a seat on the Senate\u2019s agriculture committee, said her spokesman Nathan Click.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While David Perdue opposed the Farm Bill -- the No. 1 legislative priority for Georgia farmers -- \u00a0Michelle Nunn has said since the beginning of this campaign that fighting for Georgia farmers is one of her top priorities,\" Click said.\nLawmakers across the political spectrum supported the farm bill largely because of the importance of agriculture in various states.\nIsakson and Chambliss both supported the final bill, with Chambliss taking the floor of the Senate to urge others to vote with him.\n\"There is no single piece of legislation that impacts as many people in my state as this one,\" said Chambliss, a former agriculture lawyer.\nOpposition came mostly from the far-left and far-right of each party. Democrats who voted against the bill complained about $8.6 billion cut over a decade to food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. Republican opponents claimed those cuts did not go far enough.\nPerdue sides with the GOP opponents to the measure, said spokesman Derrick Dickey. He believes that Congress missed an opportunity for a broader overhaul of the food stamp program.\n\"We have seen exponential growth in food stamps throughout the years,\" Dickey said. \"David supports a discussion focused on getting those people back to work, separate from protections from farmers.\"\nThat sort of debate would require a bifurcated bill, to fund agriculture and nutrition. An effort to do just that failed in Congress before lawmakers rallied behind the compromise.\nWith that history, it is clear that Nunn is correct to say Perdue did not support the 2014 farm bill.\nBut it is an overreach to imply that opposition to the bill translates into opposition to farmers or agriculture.\nWe rate her claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07156"}
