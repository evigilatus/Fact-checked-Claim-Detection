Trump and the Democrats want a national paid leave program. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York says such a program would boost the economy.\n\"If we had a national paid leave plan, it would potentially put into the economy $21 billion annually,\" Gillibrand said at a conference hosted by the Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy and advocacy organization.\nGillibrand has sponsored a bill that would provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave annually through a weekly payroll deduction. Trump\u2019s plan provides six weeks of paid leave by expanding unemployment insurance funds. Both plans would allow paid time off work after the birth of a child. Gillibrand\u2019s plan would also allow paid leave for a temporary disability or to care for a relative.\nBoth proposals face an uphill climb in Congress because many Republicans oppose a national paid leave program. Gillibrand hopes her claim of an economic benefit persuades other senators to support her bill.\nBut is she right?\nWhere the number came from\nGillibrand cites a 2016 report from the Center for American Progress.\nThe report found people who take unpaid or partially paid leave lose $20.6 billion in wages each year. Researchers used federal data on the number of people who take unpaid or partially paid leave and their median wage to come up with the number.\n\"I was trying to figure out how much these people are losing \u2026 because they have to take unpaid and partially paid leave while they\u2019re out either because of caregiving responsibilities or temporary disability,\" said Sarah Jane Glynn, former director of women's economic policy at the Center for American Progress and a co-author of the report.\nThe cost of a national paid leave program is not included in the report. Glynn said that was intentional.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Until we come to a consensus on what this program should look like it\u2019s kind of difficult to say what it\u2019s going to cost to taxpayers,\" Glynn said.\nGillibrand touts a $21 billion boost to the economy, but that\u2019s not what the report says.\n\"That paper did not say including paid family leave would increase the economy by $21 billion. It said it would give workers $21 billion more and that\u2019s a key distinction,\" said Ben Gitis, director of labor market policy from American Action Forum, a center-right policy research organization.\n\"It sounds like they kind of looked at one side of the coin,\" said Vanessa Brown Calder, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research foundation. \"There\u2019s also some consequences and costs to instituting paid parental leave policies.\"\nAny plan would be paid for with tax dollars or a payroll deduction. The Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, a nonpartisan research group focused on women\u2019s issues, released a report earlier this year that said close to $33 billion would need to be raised each year to fund Gillibrand\u2019s plan.\n\"There was some flippage in the language,\" said Jeff Hayes, program director for job quality and income security at the institute, of Gillibrand\u2019s claim. \"An economist might tell you that just the uncompensated wages don\u2019t actually grow the economy.\"\nHayes did not dispute the Center for American Progress report\u2019s estimate of lost wages. The number may even be higher, he said.\nOur ruling\nGllibrand said a national paid leave program \"would potentially put into the economy $21 billion dollars annually.\"\nResearchers say workers would receive at least $20.6 billion in paid leave. But Gillibrand\u2019s claim ignores the money that would be taken out of the economy to pay for it. The program would be adding money to the same pot it\u2019s being taken from.\nHer claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
