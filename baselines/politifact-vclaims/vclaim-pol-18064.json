There are new travel advisories, different rules in place for foreign nationals and new screening procedures.\nAs of March 5, 2020, the State Department recommends that people not travel to China or Iran and reconsider travel to South Korea, Italy and Mongolia. Advisories for each location \u2013\u2013 like this one for Italy \u2013\u2013 provide additional details on specific areas of the country and health information for that area.\u00a0\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends people avoid all nonessential travel to those same countries and has a coronavirus-related travel page that provides guidance for international travelers.\u00a0\nThere are new screening procedures for people arriving to the U.S. from \"high-risk countries.\" Foreign nationals who have spent the past 14 days in either China or Iran will not be permitted inside the country, according to the CDC. The rules are different for U.S. citizens. They may be subject to health monitoring after leaving either of those countries.\u00a0\nSeveral airlines have suspended or reduced operations to certain locations due to concerns for COVID-19 and reduced demand.\u00a0\nAmerican Airlines and Delta Air Lines are both halting flights to and from Milan, Italy, as well as several airports in or around China. Both airlines also announced a reduction in service between the U.S. and South Korea. United Airlines made similar changes, suspending operations to and from several Chinese airports, including Beijing and Shanghai, and Hong Kong.\u00a0\nThis sweeping claim exaggerates current coronavirus-related travel restrictions and omits critical information. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18064"}
