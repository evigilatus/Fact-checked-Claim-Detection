She referred to the experience of one Rhode Island company to illustrate her point.\n\"I go back to the Newport Tent example,\" she said on the show that aired Sept. 7. \"Every time they work in a city or town they have a whole different set of permits that they have to get in order to pitch a tent.\"\nThis particular claim about Newport Tent sounded familiar to us. It turns out that former Journal staff writer Cynthia Needham (now an editor at the Boston Globe) wrote about the company\u2019s struggles with permitting in a May 4, 2010 story with the headline \"New bills could reduce red tape.\"\nIn the story, Newport Tent owner Bill Corcoran complained about the time and effort it takes to comply with all the differing rules in Rhode Island\u2019s 39 cities and towns. During the busy season in spring and summer, one employee devotes her time to driving around the state getting all the necessary permits, he said at the time.\nBut that was four years ago. Weren\u2019t the nine proposed bills written about in that article supposed to create more uniform permitting processes and put time limits on how long communities have to complete requests?\nWhen we contacted Taylor\u2019s campaign, her campaign manager, Zach Sherman, first pointed us to the Rhode Island statute that requires Newport Tent -- or any other tent company - to obtain permits from local authorities.\nThe link he sent was out-of-date. The General Assembly recently changed the law, increasing the minimum size of tents subject to local approvals from 120 square feet to 350 square feet.\nSherman also gave us Corcoran\u2019s number, so we called him. Our first question was the obvious one. Haven\u2019t things gotten better since that 2010 package of legislation won passage?\nNo, he said flatly.\nThe problem isn\u2019t so much that each of the state\u2019s cities and towns requires a permit before Corcoran\u2019s company can put up a tent, it\u2019s that the requirements for those permits vary so widely, he said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome communities require a trip to the building inspector and then the fire department. Some reverse the process. Others call for two visits to the building department. There is little consistency, he said.\nFor example, he said, Providence requires a signed form from a property owner authorizing a tent to be put up. No other community requires such an authorization.\nWe looked at regulations in other cities and towns and found more differences. \u00a0In Cranston, tent stakes must be installed at least 10 feet apart and aisles must be at least 44 inches wide, according to rules posted by that city\u2019s Fire Department. The Watch Hill Fire Department in Westerly isn\u2019t so specific, requiring only that there be no trip hazards in the tent.\nCorcoran also said Newport is the only community in the state that allows his company to do business by phone or mail, largely because of the company\u2019s 40-years-plus year history of work there. Permit applications in all other cities and towns must be done in person.\nCorcoran says there\u2019s more flexibility in Connecticut and Massachusetts. In Connecticut, where his company erected a tent last weekend, everything was done by phone and email, he said.\n\"That was easy,\" he said. \"They had the forms right online.\"\nIn Rhode Island, he said, he still has an employee who works nearly full-time on permitting in the state.\nOur ruling\nCatherine Taylor said that tent companies such as Newport Tent must meet different permit requirements in each of Rhode Island\u2019s cities and towns.\nAlthough the state legislature has worked to ease the regulations governing Newport Tent and other tent companies, one thing hasn\u2019t changed. Those companies must still seek permits from cities and towns through processes that vary widely and have differing requirements.\nWe rule Taylor\u2019s claim True.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07255"}
