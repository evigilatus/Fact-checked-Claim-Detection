Bernie Sanders turned his sights on Walmart this week.\n\"While Walmart claims it cannot afford to pay its workers $15 an hour, it was able to find enough money to pay its CEO more than $22 million last year,\" Sanders tweeted.\nSanders unveiled the Stop WALMART Act on Nov. 15 to \"put an end to their outrageous greed.\" The bill would bar companies from buying back stock unless they adopt the $15 an hour wage and allow workers to earn seven days of paid sick leave per year. It also would limit executive pay to no more than 150 times median employee pay.\n\"The Walton family of Walmart is the wealthiest family in America, worth $180 billion,\" Sanders said in a series of tweets directed at Walmart. \"Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart\u2019s horrendously low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion every year.\"\nThere was one stat in particular that caught our attention: Are U.S. taxpayers really subsidizing Walmart\u2019s workforce at a cost of $6.2 billion a year?\nGiven the total tax revenue collected by Sanders\u2019 home state of Vermont was $5.9 billion last year, this would be a pretty staggering figure. We decided to dig in.\nWe asked the Sanders camp for leads on where the figure came from and didn\u2019t hear back. But we\u2019re pretty confident we found the source.\nThe $6.2 billion figure first appeared in a report from the advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness that came out on tax day in 2014.\n\"Walmart receives an estimated $6.2 billion annually in mostly federal taxpayer subsidies,\" the report said. \"The reason: Walmart pays its employees so little that many of them rely on food stamps, health care and other taxpayer-funded programs.\"\nA Google search indicates that the figure made dozens of headlines when the report was released, and continues to be cited in articles on Walmart -- it showed up in a story last year on The Intercept, for example.\nSo how did Americans for Tax Fairness come up with the figure? The group relied on data from a report released by the Democratic staff of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce in May 2013.\nFor that report researchers used Wisconsin Medicaid enrollment data from 2012 \"because it appears to be the most recent and comprehensive.\" Walmart was found to have more employees on Medicaid -- 3,216 -- than any other employer in the state.\nFrom there, the Democratic staffers assumed that Walmart employees enrolled in Wisconsin's BadgerCare+ Medicaid program were also enrolled in other federal benefits programs, such as subsidized housing, food stamps, home energy assistance and child care subsidies.\nTaking all these costs together, the researchers estimate that a single Walmart supercenter with 300 employees costs $904,542 per year \u2013 about $3,015 per employee. Then they ran the numbers again factoring in some employees who aren\u2019t enrolled in BadgerCare+, but could be, which upped the figure to $1,744,590 per year \u2013 about $5,815 per employee.\nAmericans for Tax Fairness then took the midpoint of these figures, $4,415, and multiplied it by Walmart\u2019s estimated 1.4 million person workforce at the time.\n1,400,000 x $4,415 = $6,181,000,000\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there it is. About $6.2 billion (not \"at least,\" as Sanders tweeted).\nBut the figure has been controversial since its inception. The House Committee report includes a qualifier about the difficulty of trying to extrapolate the Wisconsin data across the country. Wisconsin has lower poverty levels than many other states, it notes. And, Wisconsin makes it easier than many other states to enroll in Medicaid.\n\"Because of varying program eligibility requirements across states, extrapolating taxpayer costs for Wal-Mart stores in other states based on the Wisconsin data is difficult,\" the report says.\nIn his tweet, Sanders also referred to \"middle class taxpayers\" footing the bill. The House Committee and Americans for Tax Fairness reports encompass everyone who helps pay for public benefits programs -- not just the middle class. \u00a0\nIn 2014, when the numbers were fairly fresh, MSNBC host Ed Schultz got a Mostly False from PolitiFact\u00a0for citing the $5,800 in assistance per employee figure, which came from the same reports. \u00a0\nFour years later, the figures are even more tenuous.\nWalmart\u2019s workforce has increased to about 1.5 million employees and the company has raised wages significantly. The Democratic staffers cited an average $8.81 hourly wage for Walmart sales associates in the 2013 report. Walmart announced in January this year that it would raise its base wage to $11 an hour. And then there's cost of living increases.\u00a0\nSo maybe these forces cancel out. But who knows?\nDennis Bailey, communications director for Americans for Tax Fairness, said the group stands by the accuracy of it\u2019s research, but hasn\u2019t revisited the figures since Walmart increased wages.\nBailey added that critics of the group\u2019s research hadn\u2019t come forward with any data to refute their figures. \"You take a small sample and extrapolate -- that's done all the time in a data world. There isn\u2019t any reason to think that doing it in a different state would give different results,\" he said. \u00a0\nWalmart isn\u2019t much help. Company\u00a0reps have previously rejected the figures in the Americans for Tax Fairness report, but have not provided alternate data.\nJustin Rushing, head of corporate communications for Walmart, said in an email Friday he had no comment on the veracity of the $6.2 billion figure. He pointed to a 2005 report from Jason Furman, then chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, about Walmart\u2019s low wages and who benefitted from America\u2019s expanded social safety net.\n\"The bulk of the benefits of these expansions go to the workers that receive them, not to the corporations that employ them,\" says an abstract of\u00a0Furman's report.\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart\u2019s horrendously low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion every year.\"\nSanders is using old numbers that appear to be suspect from the beginning. But there's no\u00a0updated research that we could find.\u00a0\nThere is an element of truth in that some Walmart employees offset their wages with public assistance programs. And given the size of Walmart\u2019s workforce it could very well add up to billions of dollars.\nSanders also added a class element that wasn't in the initial research, claiming that the $6.2 billion in taxes came only from the \"middle class,\" which seems to be political flourish not grounded in facts.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01253"}
