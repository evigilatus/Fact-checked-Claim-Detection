We've had a lot of records of past crimes as more Republicans than Democrats, \"Kuchner Laura Ingerham said on Fox News April 1. Ingraham enters: \"Hey, hey, hey. You had more ex-cons as Republicans than Democrats? Kouchner replied: \"These are the statements I have seen. I think that would surprise a lot of people when they see the new alliance that President Trump is building for the Republican Party. Do ex - criminals hurry to join the Trump concert in Florida? We have found no state-level data to support Kouchner &apos; s conclusion that more former figures have been registered as Republicans since the entry into force of a new law. At this stage, his comment is merely a wish. We called the White House to ask for Kochner's data and didn't get a reply. Amendment 4 allows criminals to vote in November, voters agreed to Amendment 4, which restored the voting rights of Florians with convictions for a felony upon completion of their sentence. It does not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offences. The legislature has been discussing how to define the meaning of supplementing provisions, while defenders say that they do not need other legislation. Notwithstanding that battle, the fourth amendment entered into force in January 8, and some former factions have registered to vote. We interviewed election officials and professors studying the vote, as well as supporters of Amendment 4. No one can refer to any state-wide data showing the party breakdown of newly registered ex-offenders. The application for voter registration in Florida requires applicants to check a box that says: \"I confirm that I am not a convicted criminal, or if I am convicted, my right to vote has been restored.\" However, there is no way to separate those whose rights have been restored from those who have never been criminals. A spokesman for the Florida Electoral Chamber told us that she did not have party voter registration data for former offenders. This leaves us with narrative reports that may not be statistically representative. Professor Daniel A. Smith at the University of Florida said that he and his students recognized 61 Floridaians who described themselves in January's media reports as \"returnees\" - criminals who regained the right to vote. They were able to find 39 people who had entered the voters list in Florida by February. He warned that it was not a representative sample, but that they had found it: of these 39 individuals, 25 were Democrats, 10 were non-party members and 4 were Republicans. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2012, a few of the experts we interviewed questioned whether Kouchner was referring to the NBC report in February on the registration of criminal voters. A graph in that report was entitled \"Florida criminal before the vote\" and said, \"New records, top 10 provinces.\" The story says: \"between December and January, Democrats saw a net gain of 711 new registrations in the top 10 provinces of Florida. In fact, the Republicans experienced slightly greater gains at that time in those provinces, increasing 717 registrations.\" So that chart showed that GOP had a 6-vote rim. However, the data appear to reflect all registrations in 10 provinces, not just criminals. Although there are ethnic differences in the criminal justice system, and the majority of black voters are Democrats, in large numbers more whites can regain the right to vote in Florida. The National Sentencing Project in 2016 found that of the 1.5 million ex-combatants in Florida who could not vote, about 28 per cent were black. Of the 72 percent who were not black, most were white, and a modest number of Latinos. Michael Morse, JD candidate at Yale Law School and Ph.D. candidate at Harvard Ministry of Government, said that he planned to analyse voter registration and conviction data to determine the party structure of the newly registered former film. He said: \"Though I'm working on it, it is not possible to assess Kochner's claim so far.\" According to Morse, who, along with Professor Mark Meredith, Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, considered the political behaviour of the 150,000 former soldiers who had been restored by the Government, much depends on the ethnic breakdown of those first registered. Charlie Christ about a decade ago. They wrote about their results in a November article for Fox. They found that the former black militia was very supportive of the Democratic Party, but all the other former militia in the state were slightly more supportive of the Republicans. In total, they found about 19,500 former individuals whose rights were restored in the 2016 Christian elections -- about 58 per cent of registered Democrats (largely black), 24 per cent of registered Republicans (mostly non-Black) and the rest registered with either party. Researchers have concluded that if all ex-combatants could vote in 2016, the Democrats would have received a net of 48,000 votes. Trump won the state more than twice that margin. \"It is clear that there is a preference for the Democratic Party, but it is not a huge preference, especially for voting because of a lack of turnout,\" he said. However, the same party preferences may not apply to the population of Amendment 4, as Morse said. Of all the former Krest whose rights were automatically restored under Christ, 38 percent were black. Of all the previous crimes in the state, as estimated by the sentencing project, only 28 per cent are black. Nor is anyone yet aware of the outcome of the battle in the state legislature over the determination of fines and fees to be paid as part of the completion of the judgement before the vote is registered. \"In short, everything in the air,\" he said. \"It is not yet clear who will benefit from the Fourth Amendment and what demographic compositions of that population group.\" Our judgment, Kochner, said that Florida has overstepped the law where former offenders can vote now. We've had a lot of previous crime records as more Republicans than Democrats.\" The State party stated that it did not have data showing a biased breakdown of former offenders who had registered to vote since the Fourth Amendment entered into force on 8 January. Previous research has shown that former blacks are heavily inclined towards the Democratic Party, while non-black voters tend, but to a lesser extent, to the Republican side, to the Democratic Party. We evaluate the data based on available data, and so far none to support the Kouchner statement. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c407cdf9-9af9-4965-a7f4-03fd901e9923", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00784"}
