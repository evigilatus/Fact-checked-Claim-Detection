Americans know \"every little tidbit about every other president,\" but Obama\u2019s past remains a mystery, according to the e-mail.\n\n\"Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from Obama's past, saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend, etc.?\" the e-mail states. \"Not one person has ever come forward from his past.\"\n\nIt\u2019s amazing this e-mail was even sent over the Internet, because PolitiFact New Jersey found that it only takes a few Google searches to realize how ridiculous the claim is.\n\nIn books and various other media accounts, friends and former classmates have provided memories of the future president, from body surfing in California and cooking in a New York City apartment to running the Harvard Law Review.\n\nOur PolitiFact colleagues gave a Pants on Fire to a similar claim from Donald Trump, who said Obama\u2019s former classmates \"never saw him\" and \"don\u2019t know who he is.\" In that ruling, PolitiFact outlined different news articles with people remembering Obama.\n\nSo, let\u2019s review some of what PolitiFact New Jersey found:\n\nObama began his higher education in 1979 at Occidental College, a small liberal arts college in Los Angeles. In a video interview with The Gazette in Colorado, Barbara Thummalapally recalled how she and her husband became friends with Obama at Occidental.\n\nAfter partying until about 4 a.m. one weekend, Thummalapally said, \"Barack says, \u2018Oh, I got to go to my room, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Why are you leaving now?\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got a paper to write.\u2019\"\n\nOne of Obama\u2019s freshman roommates at Occidental, Paul Carpenter, also \"recalled Obama as \u2018a good bodysurfer\u2019 who had \u2018a funky red car, a Fiat\u2019 and who also played intramurals \u2014 flag football, tennis and water polo,\" according to a May 2008 Associated Press story.\n\nIn 1981, Obama transferred to Columbia University and shared an apartment with Phil Boerner. In a 2009 column in Columbia College Today, Boerner wrote about living with Obama and spending time with him in New York City.\n\nRegarding their apartment\u2019s irregular heat, Boerner wrote: \"When the heat wasn\u2019t on, we sometimes sat with sleeping bags or blankets wrapped around ourselves and read our school books. We also didn\u2019t have regular hot water and sometimes used the Columbia gym for showers.\"\n\nSohale Siddiqi, who also shared an apartment with Obama during his time in the city, recalled how women thought Obama was a \"hunk,\" according to that Associated Press story.\n\n\"You know how it is. You go to a bar and you try hitting on the girls,\" Siddiqi told the Associated Press. \"He had a lot more success. I wouldn't outcompete him in picking up girls, that's for sure.\"\n\nMore recollections can be found from Obama\u2019s years at Harvard Law School between 1988 and 1991, where he would meet several individuals who later joined his transition team.\n\nHarvard classmate Cassandra Butts, who served as the team\u2019s general counsel, spoke of Obama\u2019s Harvard experience in a 2008 interview on the PBS show Frontline:\n\n\"He was very mature, and he was very directed. He knew what he wanted to do: get his law degree and learn as much as he possibly could and take that experience back to Chicago and work in the same communities that he had worked as an organizer.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nA chain e-mail making the rounds in New Jersey claims \"no one ever came forward from Obama\u2019s past, saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend.\"\n\nAs various news accounts indicate, this claim is bogus. Friends and former classmates have participated in numerous interviews, telling tales of Obama\u2019s years leading up to his run for the White House.\n\nThat\u2019s why this chain e-mail deserves just three words: Pants on Fire!\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
