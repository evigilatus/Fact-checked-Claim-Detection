Now Facebook posts like this one are alleging that the man who is in jail on that murder charge isn\u2019t the officer in the video,, using widely shared photos of Chauvin as evidence.\u00a0\n\"Can someone clear something up for me?\" the June 4 Facebook post says. \"Who are these two men?\"\u00a0\nThe post shows two images: one is a mugshot of Chauvin, and the other is a still of him from the video. In each photo, Chauvin\u2019s ear is circled.\n\"The one on the left the media tells us is the one who\u2019s been arrested and is currently sitting in the Hennepin County jail,\" the post continues. \"And of course as the world knows, the one on the right is the one who murdered George Floyd. After all he looked right into the camera multiple times for multiple minutes while he continued to exert ever increasing pressure on his neck. Help a brother out.\"\nThe claim is unfounded and amounts to another so-called \"false flag\" conspiracy theory that we see follow so many high-profile and often violent deaths that draw global news coverage. Since Floyd died on May 25, we\u2019ve fact-checked false statements suggesting the 46-year-old\u2019s death was staged and that the protests have been orchestrated by powerful hands.\nIn comments on this Facebook claim about Chauvin, users agree that these are different men in the photos. As evidence, they note differences in hairline, skull structure and ears. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

In the mugshot, he is looking straight at the camera while in the video his chin is angled down and his head turned to the side.\u00a0\nThis reporter experimented with her phone\u2019s camera and found that her hairline, bone structure and ears appeared differently when imitating the angles of these photos.\u00a0\u00a0\nA different mugshot of Chauvin, seen here in the June 3, 11:40 p.m. post down the page, shows him in two images \u2014 in profile and staring straight at the camera. The images help to highlight how Chauvin\u2019s hairline and ears can look different depending on the camera angle.\u00a0\nThe mugshot in the Facebook post is from the Ramsey County Jail, where Chauvin was held after first being taken into custody. He was later transferred to the Hennepin County Jail \u2014 which released another mugshot \u2014\u00a0and then moved to a corrections facility in Oak Park Heights, Minn., partially due to COVID-19 concerns, a local CBS affiliate reported. There are no credible reports about confusion over Chauvin\u2019s identity or location.\nClaims that the person in custody is someone else are unfounded and defy what we know from public records.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17887"}
