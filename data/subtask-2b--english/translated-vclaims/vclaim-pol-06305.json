Trump said, \"Our real hero is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.\" \"Don't believe 5.6. Don't believe it.\" In the past, we have come up with the idea that the government cooks books somehow when the unemployment rate is calculated. However, are there 18 to 20 percent legitimate statistics? (Trumbe's employees did not respond to inquiries from Poletti Fact) As is the case, there are unemployment measures that exceed the normal unemployment rate (in fact 5.5 per cent, not 5.6 per cent, as Tramp said). However, none of the more extensive measures is approaching the level proposed by Tramp. The most extensive statistics according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, called the U-6 rate, are sometimes presented as a more \"complete\" picture of unemployment. It includes not only those who are officially considered to be \"unemployed,\" but also those who work part-time for economic reasons, as well as those who are \"frequently associated\" with the labour force, which means that they want to work but have not sought employment lately enough to be counted as active in the labour force. Currently, the U-6 rate of \"deficit use of labour\" is 10.8%. This is more than the standard unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent, but also far below the 18 to 20 per cent claimed by Trump. So is there any other reliable way to calculate it? Maybe. One can combine a more expanding measure of underemployment than U-6 -- a measure that attracts more Americans whose career has been affected by weak post-recession labour markets. For example, the university or six new graduates who did not enter the labour market are not counted primarily because they feared that there would be no jobs for them, and do not count people who chose to take care of their children full-time, returned to school or retired early to avoid having to compete for a job. The size of this set is not possible given the type of data that BLS collects, but we can at least calculate something roughly a higher limit. To do this, we can use data that show how many people 16 or more are \"not in the workforce\" -- those who are not working and are not looking for work. If you take the number of people in this category at the beginning of President Barack Obama's term of office and compare it with today's number, this gives an idea of how many people have left the workforce in the wake of the recent recession. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. As of January 2009, 80.5 million Americans out of 16 and above were not in the labour force. Today, this number is just under 93 million. Therefore, the number not in the labour force has increased by some 12.5 million. If you treat this figure in the U-6 account (and subtract a \"blind\" category to avoid double counting), you will get a rate behind the envelope of 16%. But even this is almost too high, as this assumes that every one of these 12.5 million Americans who stay out of the labour force in Obama's years has done so because of the weakness of the labour market. In fact, we are in the midst of the first large wave of child retirement, so a share of those 12.5 million is likely to reflect this large pool of historically retired people. For the sake of argument, let's assume that half the additional increase in the number of people outside the labour force comes from the surge in the retirement of the bum child. This means that the \"new\" unemployment rate -- maybe we can call this new census \"U-7\" -- is about 13%. Other speculations would produce slightly higher or lower ratios, but what is important is that the figures in this range are much lower than 18 to 20 per cent mentioned by Trump. \u2219 Access to up to 18 or 20 per cent is likely to require entry into the count of high school and college students and people who have happily retired -- that is, people who are not technically employed, but who have no reason to be. That's a very far bridge. \"The presidential candidate must know the definition of unemployment,\" said Tara Sinclair, economist George Washington University. Our Governor Trump said, \"We have a real unemployment anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Unbelievable 5.6. Don't believe it.\" Put aside his paranoia around the federal government cooking books, Trump is off the base even if you give him the maximum benefit of doubt. The highest official government census of underemployment is 10.8% -- almost half of what Trump says. If you make a quick and filthy attempt to extend this measure to other Americans left uncounted in standard statistics, there is no reasonable way to get more than 16% -- and even extend it. This is far less than Trump's, so we assess the false claim.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06305"}
