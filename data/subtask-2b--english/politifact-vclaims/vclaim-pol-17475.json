One is of Buttigieg standing in front of a barbed wire fence in a camouflage uniform holding a gun with a helmet on his arm. The second and third images are cropped closer around his face.\u00a0\n\"Some INTERESTING investigation of \u2018Mayor Pete\u2019 and his \u2018military service\u2019 photo being circulated here,\" the account writes. \"1) LOOK AT THE GUN- This is NOT set up with \u2018military\u2019 sights. And it is NOT the type issued when \u2018Pete\u2019 was \u2018deployed\u2019. 2) Um\u2026. No HELMET? The man is armed but NOT wearing his helmet? What DEPLOYED SOLDIER takes up arms without wearing their helmet in a hostile zone? 3) LOOK AT THE SUNGLASSES- The close up view shows PAVEMENT PAINTED LINES and A CAR FRONT END! This photograph was STAGED!!! This being known, I hereby label \u2018Mayor Pete\u2019 A FRAUD!!!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve already debunked claims that Buttigieg never served in the military. He was a Navy intelligence officer in Afghanistan for six months, according to military records his campaign provided to PolitiFact. News outlets have spoken to his commanding officers and fellow soldiers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was sent to Afghanistan to join a task force called the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, according to ABC News. \"We dealt with things like bank fraud, money laundering, extortion, kidnapping, human trafficking and the opium-heroin trade,\" said Army Reserve Col. Guy Hollingsworth, who was the task force\u2019s military commander when Buttigieg arrived. Journal entries Hollingsworth shared with the network describe Buttigieg accompanying the colonel on trips to meetings around Afghanistan.\nPaul Karweik, Buttigieg\u2019s commanding officer after Hollingsworth, told ABC Buttigieg \"knew the mission inside and out and he could articulate it well. \u2026 He was very organized, very disciplined.\"\u00a0\nButtigieg joined the Navy Reserve in 2009. He was a lead analyst tracking the flow of money to terrorist cells. He wasn\u2019t in combat but he took more than 90 trips outside secured military installations in Afghanistan. He was honorably discharged in 2017.\u00a0\nWe asked Buttigieg\u2019s campaign about the Facebook post. Sean Savett, a spokesman for Buttigieg, said Buttigieg was \"inside the wire\" in the photo, meaning he was on base, where he didn\u2019t need to wear a helmet. As for the gun, Savett said, \"it was typical for someone like him to not have a scope.\" There were also parking lots on base, he said, explaining the reflection in Buttigieg\u2019s sunglasses.\nIn the photo, Buttigieg is clearly posing; this isn\u2019t a candid shot. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s staged. Buttigieg\u2019s military record is clear and convincing, while these claims are unfounded.\u00a0\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17475"}
