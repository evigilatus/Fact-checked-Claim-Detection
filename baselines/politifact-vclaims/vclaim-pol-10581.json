Paul Ryan, R-Wis., as his running mate. They also were asked to comment about a recent shooting near Texas A&M University.\n\nBoth Perry and Scott cautioned about using the shooting as evidence that people\u2019s gun rights should be restricted.\n\nScott then stated an amazing statistic about guns, if true.\n\n\"I mean, I think we have more concealed weapons permits than any other state because Floridians care about their right to bear arms.\"\n\nFlorida is the fourth-most populous state in the country, so it\u2019s no surprise it would be high on a concealed permit list. But is it No. 1 ahead of Perry\u2019s Texas, which has 6 million more residents, and California, which is nearly double the size?\n\nTurns out, yes. Scott is correct.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, recently studied the number of active concealed weapons permits by state. Their report, available here, is dated July 2012 and includes concealed weapons permit data as of Dec. 31, 2011, in most cases.\n\nThe top 10 of valid permits by state breaks down like this:\n\n1. Florida -- 887,000;\n2. Pennsylvania -- 786,000;\n3. Georgia -- 600,000;\n4. Texas -- 519,000;\n5. Indiana -- 406,000;\n6. Washington -- 351,000;\n7. Utah -- 347,000;\n8. Tennessee -- 341,000;\n9. Michigan -- 296,000;\n10. Virginia -- 279,000.\n\nThere\u2019s two caveats to this list. First, several states, including Florida, allow out-of-state residents to acquire concealed weapons permits. So people living outside of Florida may have a Florida permit. Records don\u2019t distinguish by location.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s worth noting that many states have reciprocity agreements regarding concealed weapons permits, meaning that a Texas license is valid in Florida and vice versa.\n\nWe don\u2019t think either is enough to question the validity of Scott\u2019s remark, however.\n\nThree large states are missing from the Top 10 list. Illinois does not issue concealed weapons permits. California and New York are considered a \"may issue\" states, which gives those states much more discretion over who gets a permit. That in turn makes it harder to get one.\n\nAs a result, California has just 35,000 active permits, representing .1 percent of the adult active population, according to the analysis. Florida, a \"shall issue\" state, had a concealed weapons permit rate of 6.2 percent of its active adult population. Georgia ranks first at 11 percent.\n\nOur ruling\n\nScott said Florida has \"more concealed weapons permits than any other state.\" A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office study backs Scott up. The state has about 887,000 valid concealed weapons permits, nearly 100,000 more than the next closest state, Pennsylvania.\n\nWe rate this statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2010 in a news release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Lee Logan \u2022 February 26, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Correction: Our concluding graphs originally gave Georgia the No. 2 ranking and ignored Pennsylvania, which is rightly No. 2.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10581"}
