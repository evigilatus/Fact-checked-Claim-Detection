The Old Dominion and New Jersey are the only states that choose governors the year after presidential elections. There isn\u2019t much else to feed political junkies during these odd years.\n\nBut the 2009 Virginia gubernatorial race particularly piqued national interest. It came a year after Barack Obama carried Virginia, marking the first time in 44 years a Democratic presidential candidate won the state. Suddenly, reliably-Republican Virginia was recast as a critical swing state presidential politics. McDonnell\u2019s popularity in Virginia created a buzz about his potential for the GOP national ticket in 2012.\n\nMcDonnell, still seeking to nail down his gubernatorial win, dismissed the speculation.\n\"The candidate doesn\u2019t want to talk about future ambitions, saying he will serve his full four-year term through 2013 if elected,\" The Virginian-Pilot reported on Oct. 17, 2009.\n\nTwo days later, during his interview with Nobles, McDonnell said, \"You know, there\u2019s a lot of \u00a0number of national political pundits that are paying an exceptional amount of attention to Virginia. I am running to be governor of Virginia...I am fully committed to four years as Virginia\u2019s governor.\"\n\nA month after his inauguration, McDonnell reaffirmed the pledge. Dispelling rumors that he might run for the U.S. Senate in 2012, McDonnell told WTOP Radio on Feb. 23, 2010: \"I am absolutely planning to serve for four years.\"\n\nMcDonnell\u2019s response changed earlier this year when asked, for the first time, whether he would be interested in joining the GOP ticket in 2012 as the vice-presidential candidate.\n\n\"What if the party\u2019s nominee.. came to you and said \u00a0\u2018for the betterment of your party and your country, I need you to serve as my running mate.\" Nobles asked during a \u00a0February 21 interview\u00a0this year. \u00a0\"Wouldn\u2019t that be a difficult thing for you to turn down?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" McDonnell replied.\n\nMcDonnell then stressed that he was honored to be governor and was not seeking to join the national ticket.\n\nMcDonnell expressed outright interest in the No. 2 spot in a Politico story\u00a0that ran Aug. 15, noting the his popularity in Virginia and his recent ascension to the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association.\n\n\"I\u2019d be very interested,\" McDonnell was quoted as saying. \"It is a swing state. I\u2019m not asking for the call. I\u2019m not looking for the call. As I\u2019ve said many times, I\u2019ve got the best job in America. But I think anybody who is in public life, if a presidential nominee called him and said, \u2018I need your help to win,\u2019 it would be a tremendous honor. \u2026 We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s going to be seven, eight, nine months before any of these decisions are made.\"\n.\nThe next day, McDonnell was accused\u00a0of reneging on his promise to serve out his term by David Mills, executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia.\n\n\"Virginians deserve an answer: Is McDonnell just a flip-flopper who won\u2019t stand by his word if it interferes with his personal political ambitions? Or did he knowingly mislead Virginia voters?\" Mills said in a news release.\n\nTucker Martin, McDonnell\u2019s chief of communications, told us: \"The governor\u2019s position has been absolutely consistent on this issue. He is fully committed to serving the people of Virginia. He is planning to serve the full four years of his term.\"\n\nMartin said the vice-presidential talk \"is a hypothetical conversation about a possible phone call that couldn\u2019t even happen until a year from now. You can\u2019t change your position on something that hasn\u2019t happened.\"\n\nBut McDonnell is no longer promising to finish his gubernatorial term. He has put out word he is interested in being nominated for vice president next year. That\u2019s a Full Flop!\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12520"}
