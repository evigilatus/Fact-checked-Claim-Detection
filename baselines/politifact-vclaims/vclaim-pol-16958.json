So, in effect those countries also have universal coverage.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nPublic Citizen\u2019s tweet showed the discrepancy between countries with universal health care and the U.S., in terms of jobs lost due to the coronavirus.\u00a0\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, the 3.5 million number is accurate, though it\u2019s estimate examined the last two weeks of March and economists labeled the total \"likely,\" not certain.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the other countries listed each utilize a universal or government-provided health insurance model, meaning citizens there are not at risk of losing their health insurance if they lose their job.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16958"}
