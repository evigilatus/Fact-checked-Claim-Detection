Pryor voted for Obamacare, and he continues to insist that it\u2019s an 'amazing success,'\" a recent email to supporters said.\nYes, Pryor voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2009, and he doesn\u2019t shy away from that vote. But has he been such a valiant supporter throughout his campaign?\nFirst, we looked to see if and when Pryor first said the Affordable Care Act was an \"amazing success.\" We found that the statement comes from comments Pryor made Aug. 6, 2013, during a visit to Mercy Hospital in Rogers, Ark. This was months before the rocky rollout of healthcare.gov, the Affordable Care Act online exchange.\n\"Well, I would say if you want a good opinion about Obamacare, go right here to Mercy Hospital and ask them how they feel about it. It\u2019s been an amazing success story so far. Now the other side won\u2019t ever tell you that. They won\u2019t tell you all the good things that are working,\" he said to a local television reporter.\nWe can\u2019t be certain if he was saying the legislation was an \"amazing success\" overall, or if it was a success at Mercy Hospital, specifically, though his campaign says it was the latter. The same week he made those comments, he also said at a different event that Mercy Hospital added 100 new jobs because of the Affordable Care Act.\nA few months later, at an event with voters Dec. 4, an attendee asked Pryor whether he still believes the law was an \"amazing success,\" according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Pryor said he had made that comment immediately after meeting with hospital administrators who believed the health care law would benefit them because so many of their patients are poor.\n\"For a lot of hospitals, that is going to keep the doors open, and that is a success right there to try to keep the rural hospital doors open,\" he said at the event.\nCotton\u2019s campaign said Pryor \"continues to insist\" that the law has been an \"amazing success.\" But looking through news reports, it seems that his August comments were the only time Pryor has used the phrase \"amazing success\" in conjunction with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout his campaign, Pryor has followed the pattern of other Senate Democrats running for re-election by saying he supports the Affordable Care Act, but there are still changes and improvements to be made.\n\"Let me say on the front end: The Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. We need to go in and reform it and fix it,\" he said on Aug. 8, the same week he made the \"amazing success\" comment.\nHe has publicly held that stance as early as March 2010, when he released a statement discussing potential amendments to the law, and he has maintained it through recent months. This June, he told Politico that \"the law \u2018isn\u2019t perfect\u2019 and that he would \u2018work to make it better,\u2019 but \u2018something needed to be done\u2019 to rein in the insurance industry.\"\nHere are some of his other statements on the Affordable Care Act since the \"amazing success\" comment:\n\n\nDec. 4, 2013 -- At the Political Animals Club in Little Rock, he said the law would be beneficial to Arkansas\u2019 rural hospitals, according to Arkansas News Bureau. He said of the vote, \"I do remember that there were a lot of other things included in there. You run into this sometimes, where maybe you like one idea in something but they put a bunch of other stuff in there that makes it to where it\u2019s something I couldn\u2019t vote for.\"\n\n\nFeb. 8, 2014 -- Pryor gave an interview to the Pine Bluff Commercial in which he said, \"With large pieces of legislation like this, if you get 80 percent of it right, then you are doing well,\" and that he would vote for the law again.\n\n\nApril 14, 2014 -- KARK television asked Pryor if he would vote for the law again. \"You know, I would have,\" he said. \"Of course, I would want to see changes back then. But I think on something like this, it's big, it's complicated, it's difficult. If you get 80 percent of this right, you've really done something. We probably did get 80 percent of it right. We need to go back and really work on that other 20 percent and get it going in the right direction.\"\n\n\nJune 13, 2014 -- At the Delta Grassroots Caucus Conference, he said the law is not perfect, but he is working on ways to fix it. \"When I talk to my Republican friends about it I say, give me something better and I\u2019ll vote for it,\" he said, according to Arkansas News Bureau.\n\n\nOur ruling\nThe Cotton campaign said Pryor \"continues to insist\" that Obamacare is \"an amazing success.\"\nWe found that Pryor said the Affordable Care Act was an \"amazing success,\" but he was likely saying it was a success for a particular hospital he was visiting at the time. That comment came a year ago, and Pryor has not repeated it since. The comment also doesn\u2019t fit with Pryor\u2019s usual talking point -- that the law is not perfect, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\nThere\u2019s some truth in Cotton\u2019s claim, but it leaves out crucial context and distorts Pryor\u2019s comments, so we rate this Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07526"}
