One of the long-standing efforts has been the Child Safety Project, run by the National Shooting Sport Foundation, the sound of weapons manufacturers, shooting range and retailers. The radio host and commentator Dana Loesh went to Twitter to reprimand President Barack Obama for neglecting this approach. \"Obama Addicted the budget of proj ChildSafe to provide trigger locks and safety groups,\" Loesch tweeted in September 4, 2014. We wanted to see whether the current administration had reduced spending on this trigger-locking programme. We e-mailed Luich's evidence program to back up the statement, but we didn't answer it. The Senior Vice-President and General Counsel of the National Shooting Sport Foundation, Lawrence Kane, explained that the Child Safety Project was a non-profit project run by his group and largely supported by the Foundation and private donations. However, during the administration of President George W. Bush, she received a great deal of government support. \"There was funding grants from the Ministry of Justice,\" Ken said. \"There were a number of different grants. They differed in size. Over time, they have totalled $90 million over eight years.\" The Foundation used the money to purchase trigger locks and safety guides. It has partnered with over 15,000 state and local law enforcement agencies in all 50 states to distribute these safety packages free of charge to firearms owners. Kane said since 2001, the programme has provided over 36 million groups, with government funds not directed towards salaries or public expenditures. There's no doubt that federal money is a simple part of what it was. And whether this happened in the Obama era is another matter. A more complicated picture than the fact-checking that Greg Kelly mentioned on January 11, 2021 in a television section says Joe Paden is on a video that talks about \"election fraud\" in \"recognition.\" \u2022 On January 12, 2021, we went to the United States of America to spend, a government website that gives anyone an opportunity to know how federal agencies spend taxpayers' money. The year 2002 was a high-water mark for federal grants to the National Shooting Sport Foundation. That year, the Ministry of Justice granted it approximately $50 million to cover the costs of fire locks and other safety materials. The year 2003 was also a strong one. Washington provided another $25 million. However, as this graph shows, the flow of government dollars to the institution then declined. In 2006, the Ministry of Justice awarded the Foundation $917,850. By 2008, the amount had decreased to $500,000. These declines occurred under the Bush administration, three years before Obama took office. The chart also shows a shift in the federal agency that supported the distribution of safety kits. In 2009, the Department of Veterans &apos; Affairs began to award the National Shooting Foundation to provide kits for Veterans. Keen said: \"The Association contacted the National Sports Foundation because of concerns it had, and had, with the return of veterinarians with post-traumatic stress disorder.\" Under the Obama administration, VA provided the basis for approximately $3 million until 2012 for the delivery of approximately 1.5 million child safety kits, according to KEN. On an annual basis, this amount is slightly higher than the amount spent in the last year by the Bush administration. Keen said that work with the Alliance was still under way and it was estimated that an additional $2 million was under preparation. According to the Ministry of Justice, the Foundation provided 32 million groups by 2005. In the seven years since then, some 4 million groups have been handed over. Luich our governor said that Obama's administration was tearing up the budget for the child safety project. In fact, the most drastic cuts occurred during the years of Bush. Obama inherited a $500,000 program. In 2009, the funding agency changed from the Ministry of Justice to the Department of Veterans &apos; Affairs. While funding for the child safety project itself has ended, the same type of group has been distributed to people &apos; s homes, albeit through different channels. Funding increased very slightly compared to the last year of the Bush administration. The work between the Foundation and the Veterans &apos; Affairs continues.
