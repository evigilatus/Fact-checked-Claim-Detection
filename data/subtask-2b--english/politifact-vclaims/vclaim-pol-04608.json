Basically, yes.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the first night was not intended to have a specific focus on foreign policy, \u00a0leaving the Democrats with three days left to discuss the issue. And Hillary Clinton -- away from the podium in Philadelphia -- issued a fairly muscular call for action against ISIS at the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Charlotte, N.C.\n\"We have to protect ourselves against terrorists,\" Clinton told the group. \"To do that, we need to lead other countries in stopping ISIS, al-Qaida, and other radical jihadist groups. We shouldn\u2019t leave that to the rest of the world to figure out on their own. That won\u2019t keep us safe.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, as it concerns the convention in Philadelphia, the RNC\u2019s statement is literally correct. Based on our searches of C-SPAN closed-captioning text, Congressional Quarterly transcripts and other video archiving services, we couldn\u2019t find any speaker who mentioned \"ISIS,\" \"Islamic\" \"terror,\" \"terrorist,\" or \"terrorism\" during the first day of the convention.\nThe closest example came in a video that quoted Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech after the mass shooting in Orlando in which a gunman who professed allegiance to ISIS attacked a gay nightclub.\n\"From Stonewall to Laramie, and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly and without fear has been met by violence. We have to stand together, be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate,\" she said.\nBut that doesn\u2019t really fit the description in the RNC\u2019s email, since the email referred to speeches at the Democratic convention, not to video footage shown of Clinton\u2019s past speeches.\nOur ruling\nThe Republican National Committee said speakers at the Democratic National Convention made \"zero mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS.\" While Clinton took the opportunity to bring up the topic at an appearance in Charlotte on the same day, the email accurately reflects what was said -- or more precisely, not said -- from the podium in Philadelphia.
