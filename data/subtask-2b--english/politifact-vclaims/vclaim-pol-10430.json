President Obama's strong leadership saved a million jobs. Since June 2009, this industry has added a quarter of a million jobs, and the auto industry is thriving again. These are good, middle-class jobs in glass, in plastics and steel\u2014jobs making things for an economy built to last.\"\n\nWith Detroit\u2019s comeback such a big topic at the convention, we thought it was worth checking to see if that was accurate.\n\nWe turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government\u2019s official source of employment data.\n\nThere are two categories relevant to this analysis. One is \"motor vehicles and parts manufacturing.\" Since June 2009, seasonally adjusted employment in this sector has increased by 165,100 jobs.\n\nThe second category is \"motor vehicle and parts dealers.\" Over the same period, employment in that sector increased by 84,500.\n\nAdd these two figures together and you get 249,600 jobs -- almost exactly a quarter million.\n\nWith statements such as these, PolitiFact considers not just whether the statement is statistically accurate, but also whether the politician or party in question deserves the credit or blame attributed to it.\n\nIn this case, determining Obama\u2019s precise role in aiding the auto industry is more a matter of opinion than fact, but experts have told us for other articles that Obama\u2019s leadership was crucial, along with help from some Republicans. So we think it\u2019s reasonable to credit Obama\u2019s \"strong leadership\" with a role in producing these numbers.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe data will change once new jobs figures are released on Sept. 7, 2012. But at the time King made the statement, his data was correct. We rate his statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
