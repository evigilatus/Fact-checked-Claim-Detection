Sen. Ted Cruz said President Barack Obama is to blame for the fact that the position hasn\u2019t been filled.\n\"Look, of course we should have a surgeon general in place,\" Cruz, R-Texas, said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union Oct. 19. \"And we don\u2019t have one because President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist.\"\nObama nominated Dr. Vivek Murthy in November 2013, but Senate Republicans blocked his confirmation the following spring because of alleged anti-gun leanings. The National Rifle Association, which scores policymakers\u2019 records on gun rights, announced that it would ding senators who voted for Murthy.\nCNN\u2019s Candy Crowley pushed back on Cruz\u2019s assertion, noting that Murthy is a doctor. Cruz acknowledged that, but repeated his original point: \"He is a doctor, but where he\u2019s made his name is as a crusader against Second Amendment rights.\"\nIt\u2019s up for debate how much of an impact the surgeon general would have in the current Ebola situation.\nBut it\u2019s bogus for Cruz to imply that Murthy -- a graduate of Yale School of Medicine -- is not primarily a health professional. It\u2019s also a bit of a stretch to call Murthy an \"anti-gun activist.\"\nA career in public health\nHere are some of Murthy\u2019s credentials as a health professional:\n\n\nReceived his doctor of medicine degree in 2003 from the Yale School of Medicine;\n\n\nIs a physician and Harvard Medical School instructor at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, one of the best hospitals in the country;\n\n\nHas contributed to vaccine development and cancer research published in several medical journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association, Science, and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute;\n\n\nCo-founded TrialNetworks, which provides medical researchers with information technology systems for managing clinical trials;\n\n\nMember of the U.S. Presidential Advisory Council on Prevention, Health Promotion and Integrative and Public Health.\n\n\nAlso of note: As a student, Murthy co-founded two India-based public health projects, one while as an undergraduate at Harvard University and the other while at Yale. The first focused on AIDS prevention, and the latter trained women in rural areas to address community health issues.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical leanings\nWhere Murthy starts to get in hot water with Republicans is with Doctors for America, which he founded and currently heads. Doctors for America is a pro-Affordable Care Act health care reform advocacy group. They started out in 2008 as Doctors for Obama, an arm of the Obama presidential campaign.\nDoctors for America\u2019s primary cause is health care reform and expanding access to medical services. However, the group also considers gun\u00a0violence a public health problem, and they have pushed gun control legislation. At a 2013 conference, they held a reducing gun violence workshop.\nOf particular concern for the NRA is a letter Doctors for America sent to Congress Jan. 14, 2013, following the Sandy Hook school shooting. Murthy\u2019s signature is on the letter.\nThe letter lays out several policy suggestions, including a ban on assault weapon sales, instituting universal background checks and removing laws that prohibit doctors from asking patients if they own a gun -- similar to other Doctors for America proposals.\nThese policy proposals are relatively mainstream and expected from someone who is a political ally to the president. They are also similar to policies supported by other medical associations, such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. But the NRA has painted the Doctors for America policy proposals as radical.\nThe NRA and Senate Republicans also made hay with Murthy\u2019s Twitter. In 2012 and 2013, he tweeted occasionally about gun violence -- expressing plainly that he believes in more gun control and that he considers it a health care issue. \u00a0\nBut does this mean he\u2019d be an advocate for gun control as surgeon general?\nWhen we asked Cruz's office for comment, spokesperson Catherine Frazier told us this: \"It is wrong to cherry-pick one line out of context from the argument that Sen. Cruz was making, which is that the president\u2019s nominee is no mere health professional, he\u00a0is a liberal activist that has indicated he would use his position to further a gun control agenda. Both Republicans and Democrats have voiced concern over the nomination.\"\nIn Murthy\u2019s opening statement at his surgeon general confirmation hearing, though,\u00a0he listed other public health issues as priorities -- including obesity (his stated primary cause), vaccine-preventable diseases and tobacco use. He did not mention gun control.\nLater in the hearing, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., read aloud one of Murthy\u2019s tweets. In response, Murthy said he would not use the surgeon general role as a \"bully pulpit for gun control.\"\nHe added: \"The role is not to be a legislator or a judge. The role is to be a public health educator and to bring the country together around our most pressing health care challenges, and I believe at this point that obesity is the defining public health challenge of our time. That is where I intend to put my primary focus.\"\nOur ruling\nCruz said, \"President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist.\"\nMurthy has a long list of credentials showing he is a health professional, including his position as an attending physician at a leading hospital. Murthy runs a health care reform organization that has pushed for gun control measures, and he has expressed personal support for gun control. But enacting gun control is not Murthy\u2019s main cause and not part of his public surgeon general platform.\nIt\u2019s no secret that Murthy is a political ally for Obama and backs his positions on gun control. But it's inaccurate\u00a0to say he's an anti-gun activist but not a health care professional. We rate Cruz\u2019s claim False.\nUpdate, Oct. 24, 2014: After we published this item, Frazier, Cruz\u2019s spokeswoman, wrote us to say that we didn\u2019t note in our original report that Cruz acknowledged Murthy was a medical doctor. We have added to the story additional context from the interview with Crowley to make that clear. Still, we continue to believe that Cruz was inaccurate to minimize Murthy\u2019s substantial record as a medical professional -- in ways unrelated to gun policy -- and caricature him as primarily an advocate. Our rating remains the same.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07092"}
