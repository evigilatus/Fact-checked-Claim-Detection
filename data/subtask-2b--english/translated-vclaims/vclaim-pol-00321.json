The allegations are often true, although the Nightbecker in us needs to point out that no governor can \"exceed\" the law without substantial legislative assistance. The ad also overestimates a few points. Let's focus on the preparatory claim first. At that time - early 2005 - families of workers who had fallen into service received US$ 12,420 as a death or benefit. What the Declaration does not say is that they may also have received the benefit of a low-cost life insurance policy supported by the Government covering soldiers for up to $250,000. About 95% of the reserves are ready to buy this insurance. In fact, they are automatically deducted from their salary unless they choose to leave. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, this overdoing, Richardson began to legislate and, through legislation, to pay for these policies for members of the New Mexico National Guard. The legislation amounts to the \"granting\" of life insurance to soldiers, as provided for in the Declaration. After Congress had raised the maximum amount of payments to $400,000, New Mexico agreed to cover the additional premiums for that coverage. At the same time, Congress has increased the death benefit of $12,420, which many others have described as shameful, to $100,000. Later in 2005 and 2006, the 18 states mentioned in the Declaration already enacted some form of legislation that improves the entitlements of military personnel. Were they all following Richardson's guide as the ad suggests? Richardson said in the February 2005 news that 21 states contacted his office about the insurance program. He said, \"Many are preparing legislation based on the New Mexico model.\" However, it is far from being a single voice in this matter. Only a few months ago, Mr. John Kerry, D-Mass, proposed a generous surge in military death benefits during his 2004 presidency. By mid-January 2005, President Bush and several members of Congress from both sides were demanding an increase in death benefits for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. We note that Richardson first proposed the payment of premiums to the United States National Guard on 4 January 2005. So it looks like he was on the lead edge of the effort.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00321"}
