More than 700 people tried it by June 5, and for many of them, it appears that the chain of symbols and numbers have turned into the words \"Mark Zuckerberg.\" This does not mean that their accounts have been hacked. Instead, as illustrated by the 2011 story on the \"Today\" web site, the series instructs Facebook to convert the number to its corresponding Facebook page identification number. Facebook was published on January 23, 2021 in Facebook, which says that users have recently registered on Facebook to track their \"out-of- Facebook activity,\" which involves bank accounts, e-mails and other applications. \u2022 On January 28, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook card is 4, according to the 2011 Business Inter story about the first people to sign Facebook. The story of \"Today\" was looking at a similar article where Facebook users shared guidance to copy @[251859230739:0] to comment and then multiply access. The text then became \"I'm gay.\" That's because the number series in this case matches the Facebook page \"I'm gay.\" The number series was the identity of the Facebook account page. \"Today\" created a Facebook page called, \"Don't panic! This is just a test, and they experimented with asking users to write the page identity number in the same formula, and you figured the text had been changed to \"Don't panic! This is just a test.\" We're assessing this wrong Facebook post.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00559"}
