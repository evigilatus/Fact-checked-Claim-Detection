Does his numbers add up? The website JobCenterOFWisconsin.com, whose secretary is appointed by Walker, is managed by the State Labour Development Department. The Department describes the site as a cost-free exchange between employers and job seekers. Its popularity appears to have grown significantly in the weeks leading up to the elections of 4 November 2014. The home page shows an ongoing record of the number of vacancies on the site. When the action plan was launched on 16 September 2014, Walker said there were over 60,000 vacancies on the site. By the morning of October 17, there were just under 80,000 on the home page of the site. This is an increase of approximately one third per month. Furthermore, the excess indication (+) besides the current account indicates that more posts are available. On 9 January 2021 on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski's fact-check database stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in the December job report), most of them black and Latin women. \u2022 15 January, 2021, we asked the Department of Labour Development to provide us with a table showing all vacancies on the site. We received it on October 9, 2014. There were more than 79,000 posts in the main part of the data table, including some 74,000 posts that had been published during the past six months. These are the ones who operate the published record on the home page of the website. There were over 65,000 lists on the second part of the data table. More on those in a minute. These figures clearly far exceed the figure that Walker claimed, which is more than 70,000. However, it is less clear whether there are many jobs already available: 1. The State itself does not guarantee the accuracy of all lists. Of the 79,000 initial on-site lists, some 41,000 are reviewed by State officials and are scheduled to expire automatically after 90 days, and the Department of Labour Development has informed us. The other 38,000 initial lists come from two national companies and the Department relies on them to update their lists. With regard to the other 65,000 names - which are not specifically counted on the home page of the website - the State has told us that it advises job seekers to warn when searching for such lists that they come from multiple sources and may include duplicates. These sources include functional builders and Krigslist. 2. Human rights and fundamental freedoms. 12 - 17 5 Thousands of jobs outside Wisconsin. Walker filed his claim in the context of posts in Wisconsin, even if he did not specifically state that all 70,000 vacant posts were within the jurisdiction. According to One Wisconsin now, a liberal advocacy group, about 13,000 job lists were for openings not in Wisconsin but in neighbouring states, a figure not contested by the Ministry of Labour Development. We found our own check, for example, about 1,100 menus in Dubok\u00e9, Iowa, and about 950 each in Rockford, El, and Duluth, Min. Finally, although Walker &apos; s claim did not address the quality of the jobs listed on the website, it should be noted that many of them are at the lower end of the payroll. Among the most commonly announced titles are the cashier, a certified nurse assistant, a registered nurse and a restaurant crew. Two of the three employers who obtained the largest number of jobs were the McDonalds and Quick Tripp store chain. Our classification (Walker) says \"more than 70,000\" of vacant posts on the government job site, Job Centrov Wisconsin.com. This figure exceeds the initial number of rostered posts. But not all lists are verified by the state and thousands of jobs outside Wisconsin. For a precise statement, but it needs to be clarified, our classification is often correct.
