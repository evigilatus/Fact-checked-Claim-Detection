They kicked me off the plane. They called me a f------ terrorist,\"\u00a0the man says in a TikTok video.\u00a0\nAnother person can be heard asking him to please calm down and saying that she was kicked off a Delta flight earlier.\nSome social media users are mischaracterizing why the man is upset.\n\"People who broke into the Capitol Wednesday are now learning they are on no-fly lists pending the full investigation,\" one Facebook post said. \"They are not happy about this.\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nBut the TikTok user who published the video didn\u2019t say the man was upset because he was on the no-fly list, a Department of Homeland Security database of \"known or suspected terrorists.\"\u00a0\nRather, the user said that he was upset because he was directed to wear a face covering.\u00a0\n\"Homeboy had a full toddler level meltdown bc he was told to wear a mask,\" the Jan. 10 TikTok post said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, released a statement on Jan. 7 urging the Transportation Security Administration and the FBI to add those involved in the attack on the Capitol to the no-fly list.\nWe reached out to Delta and the FBI about the claim in this Facebook post \u2014\u00a0and whether rioters have been added to the no-fly list \u2014\u00a0but did not immediately hear back.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, there\u2019s nothing to support the allegation in the post.\u00a0\nFirst, the TikTok user who posted the video said that the man was upset because he was kicked off his flight for not wearing a mask.\u00a0\nAnd second, if the man had been added to the no-fly list \u2014\u00a0a decision that\u2019s made by the FBI and enforced by TSA \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make sense that he would have made it to the boarding area, where this video was taken.\u00a0\nIf someone is on the no-fly list, they can\u2019t even get a boarding pass, which means he wouldn\u2019t have made it to the gate.\nWe rate this post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.\nCORRECTION, Jan. 13, 2021: An earlier version of this fact-check included a quote from the video that, upon further review, we cannot conclusively say was uttered because the audio is unclear.
