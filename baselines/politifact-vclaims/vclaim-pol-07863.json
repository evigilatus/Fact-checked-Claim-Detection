John Barrow, a Democrat from Augusta. He last tried in 2008.\nThe Second Amendment is a galvanizing issue, and politicians know it. Barrow pulled out his father\u2019s gun, his grandfather\u2019s gun and his National Rifle Association endorsement for an ad when he was fending off other challengers two years ago.\nAnd it\u2019s unlikely that many would say it was coincidence that this year, with the entire General Assembly up for re-election, state lawmakers passed a gun bill that the NRA called the \"most comprehensive\" in recent Georgia history and that critics decried as one of the nation\u2019s most extreme.\nBut can Stone really say he\u2019s the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress?\nWe decided a fact check was in order.\nWe saw the potential to check Stone\u2019s claim. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives keeps a database\u00a0of all federal firearms licenses, so a check of those names against the names of all U.S. House and Senate candidates could do the trick.\nThe only problem: There are about 140,000 current federal firearms licenses, and many are issued in the names of businesses and corporations, not individuals.\nStone was forthcoming with us about his license (he even emailed us a copy) and about how he came to make his only-one-in-the-country claim.\nFriends in the firearms industry pointed out to him in 2012 that he might be the only U.S. House candidate with an ATF license, Stone said. He said he went to multiple sources for verification, including the NRA, Gun Owners of America, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the ATF.\n\"To everyone\u2019s knowledge, I am the only one,\" Stone said. \"I have Google and Bing searched this extensively, and to the best of my knowledge and ability to check, I am the only one.\"\nHe volunteered that he would change his ad if another candidate were found to be able to make the same claim.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Bloomberg\n\n\nstated on October 18, 2010 in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia and other states with weak gun laws have more crime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Stirgus \u2022 November 9, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut our research turned up another question: Can he really call himself a dealer?\nStone has a federal firearms license. It is what\u2019s known as a Curio and Relic license. He collects, restores and trades historic firearms, at least 50 years old, and as a hobby, not a business.\nWhen we asked the ATF to assist in our search for his license, we were told that, based on a code on the license, \"he\u2019s a collector, not a dealer,\" a distinction we wondered about since his ad says dealer.\nThe ATF does issue what it labels as \"dealer\" licenses. They are largely reserved for gunsmiths, pawnbrokers and others who make a living buying and selling many types of guns.\nJerry Henry, with the gun advocacy group GeorgiaCarry.org, said he thinks Stone\u2019s YouTube claim is \"misleading at best.\"\n\"He\u2019s a collector,\" Henry said. \"That\u2019s not what I consider a firearms dealer.\"\nOthers we talked to agreed. Tim Coker with the National Firearms Dealer Network said gun enthusiasts hearing the claim would assume that Stone is a licensed dealer, selling modern firearms.\nNRA officials were not aware of Stone\u2019s claim, spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said. The group has been a Barrow supporter.\n\"He (Barrow) has stood steadfast with gun owners, hunters and sportsmen thought his career,\" Arulanandam said.\nStone remains insistent. He sent us two dictionary definitions of dealer. He also said he deals in black-powder firearms and pre-1899 firearms, which require no ATF license, restrictions or registration on buying and selling.\n\"I am a firearms dealer. I buy and sell firearms,\" he said. \"This fact is indisputable.\"\nWhen we first started the fact check, we asked Stone why he decided to tout the fact that he was a federal firearms dealer. He said the discussion of where a candidate stands on Second Amendment rights can be time-consuming. With the dealer moniker as his calling card, he said his position is immediately clear.\nIn summary, Stone, a former congressional aide, has proclaimed himself the \"only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress.\" He said he wasn\u2019t able to document that statement, but after talking with people in the firearms community, he believes it\u2019s true.\nWe couldn\u2019t find any sources to definitively prove or disprove Stone\u2019s claim of exclusivity.\nHe does have a federal firearms license for a very niche group of collectors. He contends this status allows him to make the claim that he is a gun dealer. Others suggest his statement is misleading.\nOverall, a viewer of Stone\u2019s ad needs much more information to weigh the value of his claim -- an awful lot of context is missing even though there is some truth to part of his statement.\nWe rate the statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07863"}
