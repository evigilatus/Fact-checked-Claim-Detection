Joe Kennedy III talked about the immigrant roots of a city in his Boston-area district.\n\"We are here in Fall River, Massachusetts, a proud American city,\" Kennedy said, speaking from a vocational technical high school. \"An American city built by immigrants.\"\nBreitbart, a conservative website formerly run by Steve Bannon who served as Trump\u2019s strategist, fired back at Kennedy\u2019s description of the city.\n\"No, Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants,'\u00a0\" stated the headline. \"Fact-Check: Mostly False.\"\nWe decided to do a fact-check of our own of Breitbart\u2019s claim.\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news. We found the Breitbart story glosses over the role of immigrants in the city\u2019s history.\nAs evidence, Breitbart wrote that Fall River was established in the 1600s by English settlers \"who were not \u2018immigrants\u2019 but colonists.\"\nBreitbart wrote that a native-born family, the Bordens, ran a mill in what became the town before and after the American Revolutionary War. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Breitbart said that immigrants arrived at the end of the 19th century.\nBreitbart has a point that English settlers arrived before other immigrant groups, but when the town truly took off due to the textile mills, it was waves of immigrant labor that fueled the growth.\nWe interviewed Bridgewater State University professor Philip Silvia who wrote his dissertation on local history, The Spindle City: Labor, Politics and Religion in Fall River (1870-1905). Silvia has taught courses on Fall River\u2019s immigrant and labor history.\nFall River was settled by English immigrants in the 1600s when few people lived in the area, Silvia said. But ultimately, \"it attracted immigrants like no other place,\" Silvia said.\nFall River became prominent in the 19th century when textile factories were constructed. The mills drew various waves of immigrants from different nationalities, including the English and the Irish.\nFall River incorporated as a town in 1803 and as a city in 1854.\nThe real surge occurred after the Civil War when Fall River became the pre-eminent textile city in the United States, fueling a massive influx of immigrant workers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA gigantic wave came from French Canada,\u00a0the largest immigrant group for decades.\n\"Technically one could argue it wasn\u2019t immigrants supplying the capital who built the mills, but without workers, the mills would not have succeeded as they did,\" Silvia said.\nBreitbart pointed to immigrant statistics in 1910 and wrote that immigrants \"never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.\"\nBut Silvia, who wrote his dissertation on the topic, said that by 1875, more than half of the population was foreign born.\nBy the 1870s, three-quarters of the mill population were immigrants and that population climbed even higher.\nEventually immigrants included those who were Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Jewish and Scottish. Later waves came from Vietnam and Cambodia.\nAround 1900, there were 18 ethnic groups in the city.\n\"It is an immigrant city,\" he said.\nKennedy\u2019s spokesman pointed to an article by the local newspaper that covers Fall River, The Herald News, documenting\u00a0visible signs around the city that show\u00a0its immigrant history.\n\"From the Faberg\u00e9 egg-shaped bell towers of St. Anne\u2019s Church to the Portuguese bakeries that line Columbia Street, Fall River would not be Fall River without its immigrants...,\" stated the newspaper following Breitbart\u2019s article about Kennedy\u2019s speech. \"Fall River\u2019s notable churches and many of its landmarks were built by the people who began arriving on its streets in the mid-19th century from Ireland, Canada, Italy, Lebanon, Poland and Portugal, and in recent years from Brazil, Syria, Haiti, Cambodia and elsewhere.\"\nAs of 2016, about 18 percent of the city\u2019s population of 90,000 is foreign born, according to the U.S. Census.\nWe attempted to reach Breitbart and did not get a reply.\nBreitbart wrote that, \"Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants.' \"\nEnglish settlers first established Fall River in the 1600s when it was sparsely populated. But Breitbart gives short shrift to the role waves of immigrants played in growing the community as it turned into a prominent textile city in the 1800s.\nWe rate this claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fac08248-00f0-411e-bfec-8d820025c2dd", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02454"}
