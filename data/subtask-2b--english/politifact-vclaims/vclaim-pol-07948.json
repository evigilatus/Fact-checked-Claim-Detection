Harry Reid drive the standoff at the Bundy ranch for personal gain?", "text": "The furor over Cliven Bundy\u2019s cows in Nevada has churned up some powerful speculation about the murky forces at play. A long-running effort by the federal Bureau of Land Management to stop Bundy from letting his cattle forage without paying any grazing fees (on land that was off-limits to grazing in any event) turned into a standoff between federal agents and Bundy\u2019s supporters, both well armed.\nOut of that drama came the assertion that Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid was behind it all and the goal was personal gain. Reid publicly endorsed federal action against Bundy.\nA tea party website Republic Broadcasting Network out of Texas put it succinctly.\n\"It\u2019s very simple. Harry Reid, senator from Nevada, is using federal violence to take people\u2019s land in his state so he can package it to re-sell it to the Chinese. That\u2019s what the Bundy Ranch deal is all about.\"\nThis claim and its cousins have been debunked before (a tip of the hat to Snopes). Here\u2019s the gist of its flaws:\n\n\nThe government had no interest in Bundy\u2019s property. It wanted his cattle off government land.\n\n\nReid\u2019s son had represented a Chinese firm that had been interested in developing a solar energy array, but the deal involved land far from the Bundy property and collapsed a year ago.\n\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management has identified a desert area for solar power development, but it is about 50 miles away from both the Bundy ranch and the federal land where he likes to graze his cattle.\n\n\nThe habitat protections on the land Bundy wants to use were put in place in 1994, long before there was any hint of Chinese interest.\n\n\nReid's accusers\u00a0posted an interview with Fabian Calvo, a Los Angeles real estate agent, as evidence to back up their inaccurate claim. Calvo connected the dots between Reid, his son Rory and the Bureau of Land Management.\n\"Reid\u2019s son is involved with BLM customers, putting together deals right where Clive Bundy\u2019s ranch is,\" Calvo said. \"The federal government is ready to send armed guards in to take peoples land, unconstitutionally, illegally, over what I believe is making sweetheart deals to the Chinese.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn editorial in Investors Business Daily hinted darkly that on March 14, the BLM announced support for the Western Solar Energy Plan.\n\"Coincidentally, part of that solar energy expansion includes a plan by China's ENN Energy Group to build what would be America's largest solar energy complex,\" the editorial said. \"The site chosen with the guidance of Reid's son, Rory, is in Laughlin, Nev. Laughlin is in Clark County, where Bundy's ranch is.\"\nClark County covers more than 8,000 square miles. Laughlin is about 100 miles as the crow flies from Bundy\u2019s ranch.\nAs for the ENN Energy Group, there had been a plan to turn 9,000 acres into the nation\u2019s largest solar array. According to press reports, Reid\u2019s son Rory did represent the company, and Reid himself helped recruit the company during a trip to China in 2011. But the deal hinged on nailing down long-term contracts to sell the power the massive facility would generate. When the developers were unable to get those agreements, they\u00a0backed out. That was in July 2013.\nLooking at the BLM\u2019s efforts to use federal lands as sites for solar energy, the agency released a list of 17 designated areas in 2012. The Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone is closest to Bundy\u2019s ranch, but that doesn\u2019t make it his neighbor. It is about 5,700 acres large but its closest border is at least 50 miles to the west of Bundy\u2019s property.\nThe BLM did invite energy companies to submit proposals in mid March. This was the final step in a two-year process aimed at managing the environmental impacts of any development that might take place in these zones.\nThat environmental assessment provides one possible link to Bundy and his cows. In order to offset the loss of natural habitat in the development zone, the government typically preserves or restores the same kind of habitat someplace else. The Dry Lake area is home to the desert tortoise, a threatened species.\nMike Connor is with the Western Watersheds Project, an environmental conservation group. Connor said Nevada has four areas designated as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) to protect the desert tortoise. One of those is Gold Butte. That\u2019s the federal land where Bundy has been grazing his cattle.\nSome of Bundy\u2019s defenders have said that blocking him from Gold Butte would make it easier to build at Dry Lake.\n\"That really wouldn\u2019t make any sense,\" Connor said. \"Gold Butte was set aside as an ACEC in 1994. You can\u2019t use the same land twice to protect the same habitat. There really is no connection between what\u2019s going on at Dry Lake and what\u2019s going on at Gold Butte.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Republic Broadcasting Network said Sen. Reid was behind the use of force to take away Bundy\u2019s land and sell it to the Chinese. There is nothing accurate about this claim. The dispute involved Bundy\u2019s long use of federal land without a permit. The land gained protected status long before solar energy projects were on the table. The Chinese solar energy proposal no longer exists. The land where such projects might be developed are far from Bundy\u2019s property.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07948"}
