Pete Gallego says Mexicans have one national ID in lieu of a birth certificate and voter card", "text": "State Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, who favors a GOP-backed mandate that voters show their photo ID at the polls, recently pointed to another voter ID \u2014 in Mexico. \"If you don\u2019t have this card in Mexico, you don\u2019t vote,\" he said on the Jan. 27 edition of Your News Now\u2019s Capital Tonight, holding a voter card from Mexico\u2019s Federal Electoral Institute that he described as including a photo, fingerprint and \"your life\u2019s history.\"\nIn a separate interview for that night\u2019s program, which airs weekly in Austin, Waco and other cities, state Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, who opposes voter ID legislation, said: \"You\u2019ve got to tell the whole story. In Mexico, they don\u2019t have birth certificates, for example. They don\u2019t have a lot of the same things that we have. They don\u2019t have registration cards for voters. They have one national ID. We don\u2019t have a national ID.\"\nShifting away from the hubbub about the proposed voter ID law, we wondered whether Mexicans have one national ID, but lack birth certificates and voter cards.\nIn an interview, Gallego told us that \"most of (Mexico\u2019s) population\" doesn\u2019t have a birth certificate. \"Mexico is not at a point where they have implemented the law all across the country,\" he said. \"They don\u2019t have the resources.\"\nGallego said that supporters of a voter ID in Texas are pointing to Mexico as an example of the law at work, but \"Mexicans have a national ID card for everything,\" not just voting. \"It\u2019s just a different system,\" he said.\nWhen we asked if anyone could confirm his statements, he arranged a conference call with Rosalba Ojeda, the consul general of Mexico in Austin.\nOjeda told us that birth certificates have \"been around forever\" in Mexico, but some residents in remote areas \"simply don\u2019t get around to registering the baby.\" Some people aren\u2019t registered until they\u2019re older, \"when they have the opportunity to go to the village,\" she said.\nMexicans can register their birth at any time, Ojeda said, but it\u2019s not necessarily easy. They must go to the local municipio, or municipal office, of their birthplace and bring witnesses who can attest to their birth in Mexico.\nShe said that she doesn\u2019t know what proportion of the population has a birth certificate but that the government has conducted \"a lot of campaigns\" in the \"last 15 years and so most of the people I would say now would have one.\" Birth certificates are required to access hospital services and get a passport, Ojeda said.\nOjeda also told us that the Mexican government is conducting a pilot project that gives citizens national IDs. According to a Jan. 25 San Diego Union-Tribune news article, Tijuana elementary school students became the first to register for the new identity card. \"The card is aimed at minors from ages 4 to 17, but by the end of 2012, Mexico\u2019s federal government is hoping that as many as 25.7 million children will sign up,\" eventually extending ID cards to adults as well, according to the article. \"With the document, they won\u2019t need to present a birth certificate when registering for school, medical appointments or to receive other public services.\"\nThe article also says that in Mexico, \"birth certificates and voter registration cards are the most commonly used identification documents.\"\nOjeda told us that a birth certificate is also required to get an electoral ID, which citizens need to vote.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the electoral institute\u2019s website, to vote, Mexicans must apply to the \"Electoral Roll\" by personally submitting an official form that includes their signature, fingerprint and photograph to a field office of the Federal Electoral Registry. There\u2019s an office in every electoral district. There are some exceptions, such as for citizens who physically can\u2019t go to the offices.\nSince 1991, the institute has issued free \"photo-voting cards\" \u2014 \"an essential document to exercise the right to vote,\" according to the site. They include the owner\u2019s address, electoral district, full name, age and ID number.\nKenneth Greene, an associate professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, \u00a0told us that Mexico does have birth certificates. He said that he hasn\u2019t seen a national ID, but that the country does have a voter ID card.\nAndrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center, told us in an e-mail that Gallego\u2019s statement is incorrect on both counts. Selee said Mexico has birth certificates and registration cards for voters, but the country doesn\u2019t have a national ID card. \"Their voter registration card usually serves that purpose,\" he said. \"There is discussion of creating a national ID, but it doesn\u2019t exist yet.\"\nWhile some people in rural areas don\u2019t get birth certificates, Selee said, \"that doesn\u2019t seem to be a major problem anymore in Mexico in the way it is in some countries like Haiti and Bolivia.\"\nSeparately, Greene pointed us to an undated report by the Mexico-based Be Foundation, which works to increase birth registration in the country. The report says Mexico \"has no simple system for registering births. For poor people in rural areas, getting a birth certificate can mean walking hours or even days to the nearest municipal office.\"\nKaren Mercado, the foundation\u2019s president, told us in an e-mail that \"in Mexico, more than 10 million people lack a birth certificate,\" which she said means \"no access to (citizens\u2019) most fundamental human rights to education and health programs, protection and participation.\"\nIn a follow-up interview, Gallego told us: \"My issue is not that they do not have birth certificates \u2014 it\u2019s that they\u2019re not credible... it\u2019s not that the system doesn\u2019t exist. In practical terms, a lot of people don\u2019t have them, and they\u2019re not necessarily reliable.\"\nHe told us that he was referring to the voter ID when he said Mexico has one national ID.\nTo the Truth-O-Meter.\nAs experts pointed out, the statement misfires on three fronts.\nMexicans don\u2019t have a \"national ID card for everything,\" though a pilot project is under way to issue identity cards to minors. But the federal government issues voter IDs featuring each voter\u2019s photo and other personal information. The government also issues birth certificates; according to experts we spoke with, less than 10 percent of residents don\u2019t have one.\nWe rate Gallego\u2019s statement as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13637"}
