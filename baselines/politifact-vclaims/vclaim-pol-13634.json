Parents have no legal right to object!\"\n\nWe contacted Christopher C. Plante, executive director of the Rhode Island chapter of NOM, who told us that many schools in Massachusetts -- where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2004 -- have books on the subject in their libraries.The \"poster child,\" he said, is a picture book called \u00a0\"King & King,\" \u00a0by Linda de Haan and Stern Nijland.\n\nThe book tells the story of a queen who decided it was time for her son, the prince, to marry. He rejects every princess she offers. Finally the last candidate enters, and the prince feels \"a stir in his heart.\" But it was for the princess\u2019s brother, Prince Lee.\n\nThe two marry, and the book says \"everyone lives happily ever after.\" On the last page, the two princes kiss, with a red heart covering their mouths.\n\nThe book \"glorifies the idea that it\u2019s perfectly OK to have same-sex marriage,\" said Plante. And he said the courts have ruled that the educational system has a duty to \"normalize\" same-sex marriage for grades as low as kindergarten.\n\nAsked for examples of where the book is taught to kindergartners, Plante offered just one location, Lexington, Mass., where it became an issue in 2006. \u00a0\n\nThat year, two couples -- David and Tonia Parker and Robert and Robin Wirthlin -- filed a federal lawsuit against Lexington school officials. The suit alleged that the Parkers\u2019 son was given a book in kindergarten that depicts various forms of families, including one with parents of the same gender. And, the suit said, when the Wirthlins\u2019 son was in first grade, he was read another book, \u00a0\"King & King,\" in school.\n\nThe parents said they have religious beliefs that homosexuality is immoral and that marriage is \u00a0a holy union only of a man and a woman. They alleged school officials were attempting to indoctrinate their children with the belief that same sex marriages are moral.\n\nIn 2007, The U.S. District Court in Massachusetts dismissed the parents\u2019 claims, finding that parents don\u2019t have the right to restrict what a public school may teach their children, even if the teachings contradict the parents\u2019 religious beliefs.\n\nThe parents appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit but lost. The appeals court wrote: \"There is no allegation here of a formalized curriculum requiring students to read many books affirming gay marriage. The reading by a teacher of one book, or even three, and even if to a young and impressionable child, does not constitute \"indoctrination.\"\n\nAsked for any other examples of gay marriage being taught to kindergartners, Plante referred us to Kris Mineau, executive director of the Massachusetts Family Institute, which describes itself as \"dedicated to strengthening the family and affirming the Judeo-Christian values upon which it is based.\"\n\nMineau said he has been fighting same-sex marriage advocates for eight years and he is certain their message is being spread in schools throughout Massachusetts.\n\nBut he acknowledged he could not cite any examples other than Lexington. \"I don\u2019t have documentation of everything going on,\" Mineau said. \"It\u2019s very difficult to quantify.\"\n\nMineau also said the 2007 court rulings discouraged other parents from officially complaining about their children being exposed to school programs endorsing same-sex marriage.\n\nWe looked for other evidence that Massachusetts schools are teaching kindergartners about same-sex marriage.\n\nWe asked Jonathan Considine, spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, if the state mandated curriculum on same-sex marriage for kindergartners. The answer is no, he said. Massachusetts is a local control state, so each district decides on what topics to cover.\n\nHe said, \"Massachusetts does not require that students in any grade be taught about gay marriage.\"\n\nHe said many schools have used books or promoted discussions to teach tolerance because some students have same-sex parents and there are teachers with same-sex spouses.\n\nConsidine referred us to The Massachusetts Comprehensive Health Curriculum, which includes a standard that by fifth grade, students should be able to define sexual orientation, such as heterosexual, gay and lesbian. It makes no recommendations about teaching different types of marriages to kindergartners.\n\nThen we called the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which represents 107,000 educators.\n\nLaura Bennett, a spokeswoman for the association, said she does not know whether anyone is discussing same-sex marriages with kindergartners in any of the state\u2019s hundreds of school districts. \u00a0But she is relatively certain no one else has publicly complained.\n\n\"I work on communications with teachers, and if there were other cases, I would have heard,\" she said. \"There\u2019s just that one case, over and over again.\"\n\n\"I haven\u2019t heard boo about this,\" added Thomas Gosnell, president of the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts, which represents most of the other educators in the state. \"I have not heard one of my members tell me they are talking about gay marriage in kindergarten. They are probably not talking about any kind of marriage in that grade.\n\n\"I don\u2019t even hear anyone talking about gay marriage anymore,\" he added. \"It\u2019s just there.\"\n\nBottom line: The National Organization for Marriage mailing says that Massachusetts public schools teach kindergartners about gay marriage. The wording, including the present tense verb, gives the impression this is happening now, in many schools.\n\nBut the group\u2019s only evidence is two incidents five years ago. It\u2019s possible that somewhere, in one of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, other kindergartners have been taught about same-sex marriage. But NOM couldn\u2019t cite any other examples. We find its statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13634"}
