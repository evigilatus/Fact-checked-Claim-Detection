Omar is one of two Muslim women working in Congress and a strong supporter of Muslim rights. To describe the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Omar said, \"Some people did something.\" We went back to her original speech to find the insulting phrase. Here's what we found: \"We have lived long and uncomfortable because we are a second-class citizen, and frankly, I am tired of it, and every Muslim in this country must be tired of it. \"CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they realized that some people did something and that we all started losing access to our civil liberties. So you can't say that today someone is looking at me weird, that I'm gonna try to make myself look nice. You have to say that this guy looks at me strangely. I'm not comfortable with that. I'm gonna go talk to them and ask them why. Because that's your right. You can't hate it so closely. Anytime you have a chance to go talk to someone, their chances of hating you are less. So this is a practice we all have to adopt.\" On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for inaugural security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, you can read Omar's entire notes in context. While people may disagree about the appropriateness of her description for September 11, he drew our attention through her statement about CAIR, That's not accurate. Other reports also referred to inaccuracy. The Council supports the Council for American-Islamic Relations. Founded in 1994, according to its website, \"to promote a positive image of Islam and Muslims in America.\" Annual reports on the status of civil rights of American Muslims are published; reports on its website dating back to 1996. The first CAIR report was in response to the 1995 attack on the Moreh federal building in Oklahoma, after which some people blamed Muslims initially for the bombing. The real bomber was a white American born of Timothy McPhee. We asked Omar's staff why she made a clear mistake about an organization that she said she supported. The spokesperson, Jeremy Sylvain, said that the size of the centre had doubled after the attacks of 11 September. \"It was a mistake, and she now knows that he was founded earlier,\" he said. Omar was clearly mistaken in her description of the beginning of CAIR. We assess her statement wrong.
