The population of Missouri prison was widely discussed in the state legislature with the House of Representatives, which approved Bill 113 on 21 February. The bill, known as the Integrity of Justice Fuse Act, allows flexibility in imposing a mandatory minimum penalty for non-violent crimes. This reduces the mandatory minimum limits for first-time offenders, but more importantly, it reduces the penalties for persons already in prison. The largest contributor to the prison population is reoffending, or re-incarceration of prisoners released for violation of parole or other offences. According to state prison data, on average 48.1 per cent of prisoners returned to prison in 2008-2012 within five years of their release. On February 19th, a hearing of legislators to discuss and amend the bill, Cody Smith, R. Jasper, said, \"On our current course, we will have 2,000 short prison beds by 2021... we will soon need two new prisons, at a cost of $485 million over the next five years.\" This census has been surprising since Jove. Mike Parson recently announced a plan to integrate two correctional centres because of the low prison population. How can Missouri prisons be overcrowded enough to require two new facilities, but also be able to consolidate buildings because of the small prison population? We decided to find out. After contacting Smith's office, we were sent to the Centre of Justice of the State Council of Governments. The State of Missouri partnered with the Justice Centre for the Evaluation of the Prison System in 2017 with the Task Force on Reinvestment in Justice. Smith's figures came from the Board's reports on the Missouri system. In a presentation in September 2017, the Task Force stated, \"If current trends continue, MDOC will have 2,351 prison beds without the required capacity by the end of fiscal year 2021.\" This data came from the Department of Corrections in 2016, the criminal file together with its population projections in August 2017. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, Smith also received \"two new prisons\" part of his claim from the show. According to the main page of the Missouri section of the Justice Center website, \"The State will need to build two new prison facilities by FY2021, which will cost nearly half a billion dollars of combined construction and operating costs.\" According to the September 2017 slides, \"the cost of constructing a new facility of 1,636 beds (e.g. Chilikot Women's Facility) is approximately $175 million.\" Two prisons will then cost approximately $350 million in construction costs alone. With operating costs, the cost rises to about $404 million. The operation of the facilities in the first three years would increase the cost to $485 million. Two years later, is it relevant? Sheridan Watson of the Justice Centre of the Security Council said that the prison population of Missouri had declined since 2017. This is due in part to HB 1355 of June 2018, which aims to assist law enforcement agencies in reducing violent crime, while establishing better support systems for persons with mental illness or drug abuse issues within the criminal justice system. These support systems include counselling, rehabilitation of drug addicts and more to help break addiction cycles. It also helps bills like HB 113 Smith by reducing the time non-violent prisoners spend behind bars. However, patterns and trends that drive access to prisons and prison capacity in Missouri still exist and are being addressed through the reinvestment of justice, and Watson said in e-mail. There is still no data to compare Missouri with other states in 2019, so it is not known where Missouri is. However, Karen Bojman, Director of Communications, Department of Corrections, Missouri, noted that the population \"has declined from more than 32,000 in 2017 to 29,500 this year,\" a decrease of 8 per cent. Bogman said: \"We do not spend on the numbers that remain low, but we have offered programmes to reduce reoffending.\" \"The population has been reduced enough to consolidate two prisons... we have every prison family we need.\" Our verdict, Smith, said, \"On our current course, we'll have 2,000 short prison beds by 2021... we'll need two new prisons soon, at a cost of $485 million over the next five years.\" Smith based his statement on data from 2017. Initiatives to reduce the prison population in the state have led to a reduction in the number of prisoners in the last two years. Smith &apos; s claim requires further context. More importantly, it ignores previous changes in the law that have reduced the issue of overcrowding. While it is certainly possible to make further progress to eliminate reoffending, the situation of Missouri is no longer so appalling as to make Smith's claim appear. We're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00660"}
