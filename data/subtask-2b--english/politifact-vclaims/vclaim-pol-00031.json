Jeremy Thiesfeldt.\nThe Fond du Lac Republican \u2014 a former teacher and principal \u2014 chairs the state Assembly Committee on Education. That makes him a key player in any school-related changes the Republican-controlled Legislature brings before Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.\nIn the Republicans\u2019 statewide weekly radio address on Sept. 19, 2019, Thiesfeldt said Wisconsin has to \"do better\" on education, especially given the amount of money the state spent there in the eight years of Republican control under former Gov. Scott Walker.\nThen he said this:\n\"The vast majority of Wisconsin students cannot even read, write, or do math at grade level.\"\nThat\u2019s an alarming stat if true.\nAssessing his claim takes us deep into state and national testing thresholds and some shifting definitions.\nLet\u2019s get started.\nClaim built on latest test scores\nAs proof, Thiesfeldt\u2019s staff pointed to the most recent Wisconsin Student Assessment System results. The annual tests include the Forward Exam for grades three to eight and ACT-related tests for grades nine to 11.\nIn the 2018-19 tests, 39.3% of students were rated as proficient or advanced in English Language Arts, and 40.1% reached those levels for math, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.\nFor starters, calling 60% the \"vast majority\" is overstating things quite a bit.\u00a0\nBut let\u2019s focus on the \"grade level\" part of Thiesfeldt\u2019s claim. Is it reasonable to say anyone below proficient is also below grade level?\nThat\u2019s a very complicated question.\nDPI breaks the assessment scores into four categories of student achievement: advanced, proficient, basic and below basic. We\u2019ll focus on the middle two since that\u2019s where this claim is centered.\nProficient \u2013 Student demonstrates adequate understanding of and ability to apply the knowledge and skills for their grade level that are associated with college content-readiness.\nBasic \u2013 Student demonstrates partial understanding of and ability to apply the knowledge and skills for their grade level that are associated with college content-readiness.\nKatie Scott, a policy adviser in Thiesfeldt\u2019s office, highlighted the \"adequate understanding\" element of the proficient definition.\n\"For an exam taken in the final months of the school year, we are confident that parents, teachers, etc. would not prefer the achievement of students at grade level to be described as a \u2018partial understanding,\u2019\" she said in an email.\nScott also asserted that proficient \"has always meant at or above grade level.\"\nDefinitions a moving target\nSo Thiesfeldt\u2019s argument is that proficiency = grade level.\nBut both sides of that equation are moving targets.\nThe term grade level is used at times to refer to how students perform relative to a standard set by officials, which is how Thiesfeldt uses it. But it can also refer to what students typically learn in a grade, in other words the median test score for that age level across the state.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll stick to the idea that grade level is some kind of threshold. But it\u2019s tricky equating it to proficiency since the definition of proficient has changed over time in Wisconsin.\nIn the past, the term was indeed roughly equivalent to what many consider grade level, said Alan Borsuk, a senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School and longtime education reporter and columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nBut that changed in 2013 when Wisconsin dramatically raised the achievement level needed to reach the \"proficient\" threshold. The state was aligning its standards to match the National Assessment of Educational Progress \u2014 also called the Nation\u2019s Report Card.\nIn other words, proficient no longer means what it once did in Wisconsin. Can it still be equated to grade level as Thiesfeldt does?\n\"The answer is quite emphatically no,\" Borsuk said.\nHe elaborated in his Sept. 13, 2019, Journal Sentinel column.\n\"I\u2019m increasingly willing to lump \u2018basic\u2019 with \u2018proficient\u2019 and \u2018advanced\u2019 to get a rough measure of whether kids are on grade level,\" Borsuk wrote. \"And if you do that, you come up with \u2014 to give one example \u2014 about three-quarters for Wisconsin public school students in third through eighth grade rated as basic or better in English language arts (often just called reading), which certainly looks better than saying well below half are proficient.\"\nTom Loveless, a former senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who authored the group\u2019s annual report on education trends for 16 years, said he agreed with Borsuk that a basic rating on the state\u2019s assessment system tests is roughly equal to what the proficient rating was years ago.\nBut there\u2019s still more evidence to consider.\nNational test warns against equating proficient with \"grade level\"\nA Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction spokesman didn\u2019t take a position on proficient vs. grade level beyond the definitions cited above.\nBut the go-to source for national testing sheds some light on the matter.\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a congressionally authorized project of the U.S. Department of Education that measures student achievement in select subjects across the nation.\nRemember, Wisconsin made changes to its scale get in sync with NAEP. An August 2019 study by the NAEP found the state was quite successful in doing so. The analysis scored each state from 0 to 500 in two subjects at two grade levels to show how high the bar was to achieve proficiency. That could then be compared to other states and the national scale used by NAEP.\nFor grade four math, the state and national standards were exactly the same at 249.\u00a0 For grade four reading, the score for NAEP proficiency was 238, while Wisconsin\u2019s was 229.\nThe eighth-grade scores were also very close, with the state and national threshold separated by two points for reading and four points for math.\nAnd here\u2019s what the NAEP has to say about conflating proficiency with grade level:\nMyth: The NAEP Proficient level is like being on grade level.\nFact: NAEP Proficient means competency over challenging subject matter. This is not the same as being \"on grade level,\" which refers to performance on local curriculum and standards. NAEP is a general assessment of knowledge and skills in a particular subject.\n\"NAEP proficient means mastery over challenging subject matter,\" said NAEP spokesman Grady Wilburn. \"We don\u2019t use any terms in NAEP to equate achievement level to what may be grade level in a state. \u2026 The achievement level proficient, for example, is aspirational. We don\u2019t define that as something necessary to proceed from one grade to the next.\"\nSo the Wisconsin proficiency standard is largely in line with the national standard, and the people behind the national standard warn it should not be conflated with \"grade level.\"\u00a0\nTherefore, Wisconsin should be similarly careful, Loveless said.\n\"Wisconsin set its cut point at the NAEP proficiency level on purpose,\" he said. \"So it should carry with it all the warnings that go with the NAEP proficient cut point.\"\nFor the record, Wisconsin students ranked about average in the latest NAEP data. In 2017, 40% of students nationwide tested at or above the proficient level using the NAEP standard. Wisconsin came in at 42%.\nThe NAEP study also showed Wisconsin has one of the highest bars for proficiency in the nation. The grade eight ratings were third- and fourth-highest among the states in the study, and grade four ratings came in 10th and 18th.\nOur ruling\nThiesfeldt used state test results to claim the \"vast majority\" of Wisconsin students are below grade level in math and English.\nExperts say proficient was once roughly equal to some definitions of grade level, but a dramatic shift in 2013 means that is no longer the case. Wisconsin raised the bar and \u2014 predictably \u2014 more kids then failed to clear it.\nToday, Wisconsin\u2019s definition of proficient is almost identical to that of a key federal testing agency that explicitly warns against conflating proficiency with grade level. They say proficiency is more akin to \"mastery\" of a subject.\nWe rate Thiesfeldt\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00031"}
