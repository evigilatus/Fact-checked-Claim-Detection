The image shows a worn JP Morgan Visa card with the name \"Malia A. Obama\" on it next to lines of white powder.\n\"Malia Obama\u2019s credit card used to chop and line up cocaine found on Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop,\" words above the image read.\nThis is false and follows a lengthy pattern of unconfirmed hoaxes related to the Obama children.\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The origin of the photo is still unknown, and any connection between Malia Obama and the white substance in the image remains unsubstantiated.\nWe haven\u2019t been able to review or verify the contents of the laptop hard drive allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden because the data has not been seen, at least not widely. Allies of President Donald Trump who say they have it \u2014 particularly Rudy Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer who procured the laptop \u2014 have declined to share the data with other outlets for review.\u00a0\nThe Obama daughters have been popular targets for purveyors of misinformation for years.
