One claim was for water, specifically to what extent the number of H2O Gwinnett homeowners used in recent years was significantly lower. \"The annual use of water in 2010 was actually less than 18 per cent of the use in 2006,\" Nash, President of the Provincial Board of Commissioners, said in her address on 18 May, District State. The statistics may be correct, as provincial and state officials have appealed to Georgians to use less water after state environmental protection officials announced in September 2007 that most open water was banned. The ban was lifted in June 2009. Currently, political leaders in Georgia, Alabama and Florida are struggling to conclude a water-sharing agreement. A district speaker said that the residents of Goinette and the business owners were more aware of water conservation. \"The trend of water conservation that began during the severe drought seems to be continuing,\" said Gwinnett Heather Sawyer in an e-mail explaining why water use declined in Georgia's second-highest population province. Sawyer also suggested that the Gwynette toilet reduction programme might be another factor in water conservation. The programme grants homeowners a $50-100 discount for the installation of toilets that use less water when draining water. Georgia's Politi Fakt continues to be curious about Nash's numbers. According to United States census figures, the population of the province increased from 588,450 in 2000 to over 805,000 in 2010, an increase of 37 per cent. The Nash report claimed that water use in the province had declined by 18 per cent over four years, but the population of the province had increased by 37 per cent over the past 10 years. The officials in Gwynette provided us with a table containing annual data on water use dating back to 1999. The average daily use for most years between 1999 and 2007 was approximately 84 million gallons per day. In 2007, the year in which drought restrictions came into effect, the average daily use was 86.4 million gallons per day. In 2008, average daily usage in Gwynette fell to just under 72 million gallons per day. The decrease for one year was approximately 17 per cent. This one-year drop was actually lower than the one in the region, and government officials reported the Atlanta Journal - Constitution in 2008. They said that water use in northern Georgia declined by 24 per cent from August 2007 to August 2008. We felt better about the perception of low water use in Goinette between 2007 and 2008. Therefore, let us take a closer look at Nash &apos; s allegation, a decrease of 18 per cent from 2006 to 2010. Sawyer warned us about a math error. The staff used the difference between the 2006 and 2009 totals to achieve a 18 per cent reduction. According to Gwynette officials, the average daily usage was 87.4 million gallons in 2006 and 71.3 million gallons per day in 2009. In 2010, the average daily usage was 74.7 million gallons per day. This is a 14.3 per cent decrease. Since the 14 percent reduction is very close to 18 percent, we do not consider this mistake to be so terrible. We appreciate Nash's claim that it's mostly true.
