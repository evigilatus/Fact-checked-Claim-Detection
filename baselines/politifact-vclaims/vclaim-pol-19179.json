Jon Rosenthal, D-Cypress,\u00a0who has lost a family member and friend to COVID-19, took to Twitter to dispel common myths and \"rampant misinformation\" about the virus and its vaccines, which are\u00a0now slowly being distributed\u00a0throughout Texas.\u00a0In his tweet thread, Rosenthal\u00a0echoed\u00a0a number that has commonly been\u00a0repeated\u00a0as COVID-19's herd immunity threshold.\u00a0\n\"To defeat this pandemic AND recover our economy, the safest and most effective way is for the population to be immunized,\" he tweeted\u00a0Tuesday.\u00a0\"The way to reach \u2018herd immunity\u2019 is for >70% of the population to get vaccinated.\"\u00a0\nImmunity can be reached one of two ways: through natural infections, which create antibodies in people who have recovered from a disease that can potentially ward off future infection\u00a0(an estimated 20% of the global population has been infected naturally); or through vaccination, a safer way to immunity because it does not cause illness.\u00a0\nThe herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 has been somewhat of a moving target throughout the pandemic as researchers\u00a0grapple with understanding the virus. Let\u2019s\u00a0review what current thinking is on the virus\u2019\u00a0threshold.\u00a0\nDetermining the herd immunity threshold\u00a0\nThere are two ways health\u00a0experts\u00a0think about a virus\u2019 infection rate, mathematically represented as the\u00a0R\u00a0value. First, there\u2019s the more theoretical R value\u00a0known as\u00a0the basic reproduction number, or\u00a0R0\u00a0(pronounced\u00a0\"R naught\").\u00a0This term indicates the average number of times one infected person will transmit the virus\u00a0to another person. For example, measles has an R0\u00a0value between 12 and 18, meaning that one person infected with measles will, on average, spread the virus to another 12 to 18 people\u00a0before they either die or recover.\u00a0R0\u00a0is a theoretical figure that assumes everyone in a population is\u00a0without immunity and\u00a0susceptible to infection.\u00a0\nThen there is the more practical\u00a0version of the R value\u00a0\u2014 the\u00a0effective reproduction rate, represented as Rt. The effective reproduction rate\u00a0considers the fact that some\u00a0people\u00a0within a population\u00a0will be immune\u00a0to a\u00a0disease, or that certain interventions have been put in place\u00a0to slow spread, like social distancing or mask-wearing.\u00a0The Rt\u00a0value is\u00a0more of a real-time representation of what a virus\u2019 infection rate is\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0decreases as a greater share of the population is immunized or as more interventions are put in place.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe exact R value for COVID-19, however,\u00a0has not been\u00a0concretely\u00a0determined. According to Spencer Fox, associate director of the COVID-19 modeling consortium at the University of Texas,\u00a0data during the early period of the pandemic\u00a0suggested that the\u00a0R0\u00a0rate was 2.5. Now it is believed to be within the 4 to 6 range.\u00a0The Rt\u00a0value, while much harder to determine, is estimated to be around 1.05 in the U.S. thanks\u00a0to preventative measures and natural immunities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"There's kind of been this shifting conversation about what is the actual basic reproduction number of the virus,\" Fox said. \"We try and\u00a0extrapolate from other populations, but every population will have a slightly different number.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically, it is the R0\u00a0figure that is used in determining a virus\u2019 herd immunity threshold\u00a0because the goal is to return to a state of normalcy where interventions are no longer necessary.\u00a0The threshold is calculated by plugging the R0\u00a0value into a formula: [1-(1\u00f7R0)]*100 =\u00a0threshold\u00a0%.\u00a0\nWith an R0\u00a0value\u00a0of 2.5, the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 would be 60%. With an R0\u00a0value of\u00a06, the threshold would be 83%.\u00a0\nBut according to Dr. David Dowdy, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, these numbers are highly theoretical.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe herd immunity threshold is \"something that\u2019s easy for the public to understand, but not really reflective of reality,\" Dowdy said. \"The reality is that it\u2019s a spectrum, but people like to\u00a0see things in black and white and they like to have specific numbers to latch onto.\"\u00a0\n\"At some point we will build up enough immunity.\u00a0Whether it be through people getting the disease or through people getting the vaccine,\u00a0that transmission\u00a0(rate)\u00a0will start to go down,\" he said. \"It's not like there's a magic number that we have to hit and if we don't hit it we'll forever have this pandemic with us. The more people we can get vaccinated the fewer people get sick and die.\"\u00a0\nAccording to Fox, publicizing a herd immunity threshold level, while not accurately reflective of\u00a0reality, does have usefulness.\u00a0\n\"Right now, the main use of providing a high number is to motivate people to actually get the vaccine, because in my mind we should try and vaccinate as many people as possible,\" Fox said.\u00a0\nThe 70% threshold cited by Rosenthal and others is, to Fox, \"in the ballpark.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It could be possibly as low as 50% and as high as 80%, so 70% is kind of in the middle. I would shoot higher. I wouldn't have this expectation that the disease goes away at this point,\" he said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nOn Jan. 5, Rosenthal published a tweet saying that the way to reach herd immunity is for at least 70% of the population\u00a0to get vaccinated.\u00a0In an email, Rosenthal said his information\u00a0came from a Reuters article that cited\u00a0the\u00a0European Center for Disease\u00a0Prevention\u00a0and Control\u00a0estimating a\u00a067%\u00a0herd immunity threshold\u00a0and the World\u00a0Health\u00a0Organization\u00a0estimating\u00a0a\u00a065% to 70%\u00a0threshold.\u00a0\n\"There are apparently too many unknowns to be certain, but the 70% figure lines up with some common estimates,\" Rosenthal said.\u00a0\nThe herd immunity threshold is calculated by using a disease\u2019s rate of transmission. Although scientists have not agreed upon a definite rate, and even though these rates are highly theoretical,\u00a0estimates show that the thresholds lies somewhere between 60% and 83%.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim\u00a0Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19179"}
