In the late 1980s, Moore wrote, \"The United States was almost the lowest tax country in the world, and almost a quarter of a century later we are higher.\" The allegation is in a column that President Barack Obama &apos; s proposals can effectively raise the marginal tax rate of the country &apos; s richest taxpayers to 62 per cent. We recently verified a similar allegation by the Republic of Paul Ryan, R-Wis, who said that Obama's policies would lead to the highest rate of 44.8 per cent. (Ryan &apos; s claim - which was often correctly estimated - used less extensive parameters than Moore.) After one reader suggested that we look at the column, we relied on Moore's claim for comparative international taxes. We should start by noting that most of these comparisons are made not with every country in the world, but with countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of almost three dozen large industrial democracies. This makes it a more equitable comparison. Because Moore was writing in the rest of the column about marginal personal income tax rates, we first moved on to international comparisons of those rates for OECD countries. We looked at 1988 data -- Reagan's last year in office, and a year when the highest marginal tax rates in the United States reached a new low -- as well as 2010. For 1988, the highest marginal tax rate for United States taxpayers was 28 per cent. Of the 20 countries in the OECD comparison, only one had a lower rate - Switzerland, by 11.5 per cent. So using these statistics, Moore is right. However, the highest marginal tax rates are incomplete statistics for this type of comparison. Perhaps the most important problem is that it only takes into account national taxes. Some OECD countries impose relatively light taxes at the national level but impose heavy taxes at the state and local levels. This makes international comparisons only use national statistics incomplete. So we went to another scale -- tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. This measure shows the magnitude of the total tax burden compared to the State economy. It includes national, state and local taxes of all kinds, rather than just income taxes. OECD statistics are available for 1985 in a study covering 26 States. In the United States, total tax revenue was 25.6 per cent of GDP. Only six countries received a lower percentage - Mexico, Korea, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and Turkey - a number of which were not among the highest in industrialized countries in 1985. Here again, Moore has strong support for his claim that in the 1980s \"the United States was almost the lowest tax country in the world.\" But what about today? Here, support is less solid. Given precisely the highest marginal tax rates, the United States rate was 35 per cent in the middle of the group -- Moore's claim does not stand better if taxes are used as a percentage of GDP. In 2006 - the last year for which a comparison is available between OECD - taxes accounted for 28 per cent of the GDP of the United States, a modest increase over 1985. All said, 25 countries were a higher percentage of the United States, while only four - Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey - were lower. This hardly makes the United States \"almost the highest country\" tax the world. In fact, in order to rank the first five countries on the 2006 list, the United States needed taxes to make up 43 per cent of GDP -- about double and half its actual share. When we asked Moore if there were any missing data that would prove his point of view on the tax burden of the United States today, he said, \"Today our company's tax rate is higher and our personal income tax with Obama's proposals (including) will be much higher than the average.\" And he's basically right that our corporate tax rate is the highest in the world -- we've ruled that this claim is often true in the past, although the gaps and other tax rules for many companies reduce the rate that they actually pay. However, Moore does not mention anywhere in the corporate or business tax column, so we do not believe that this strongly supports his claim. For potential tax increases under Obama, they are speculations. Because of this, we do not consider it justified to say that we are \"almost a quarter of a century later\" in taxes. It would have been safer if Moore had written: \"If the increases I have outlined here have been enacted, we may end up with some of the highest tax rates in the world.\" But even this may be a guess, because we will not know what the tax rates in other countries would be if the United States laws on Moore Heights were enacted. We have no disagreement with Moore's description in the late 1980s of a period when US taxes were low compared to its competitors. It obviously was. But the main point is that, since the late 1980s, taxes have risen markedly, an extension. On the contrary, we find convincing evidence that today the United States is still a relatively low-tax country compared to its industrial competitors. American tax rates may rise over the next few years, but this is a guess, not a proven fact. Anyway, we're evaluating Moore's comment. It's hardly true.

Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to secure the installation, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On July 27, 2011, we changed the name of the evaluation to most of the error.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13013"}
