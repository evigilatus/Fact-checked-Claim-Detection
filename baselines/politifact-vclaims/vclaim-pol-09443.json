Now there\u2019s a new catchphrase going around conservative circles: Marcophones.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard jab at U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who\u2019s supporting immigration legislation put forward by a small group of senators called the Gang of Eight.\n\nThe group recently released a draft of the legislation. Now bloggers have seized on the bill to make the claim that it gives free cell phones to illegal immigrants.\n\n\"Move Over \u2018Obama Phone,\u2019 Say \u2018Hola!\u2019 to the Marco Rubio Immigration Phone, AKA MarcoPhone,\" said The Shark Tank, a conservative South Florida website.\n\n\"According to the newly filed bill, immigrants who are allowed to enter the United States under a work visa, will be \u2018granted\u2019 a taxpayer funded cellular phone,\" it continued.\n\n\"Immigration bill contains Marcophones,\" repeated the conservative website Breitbart.\n\nSoon, the story was zipping around the Internet, in one case even sent out by a staff member of U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who opposes the legislation.\n\nIt prompted Marco Rubio to take to Twitter in protest of the rumors. \"Report that claims #immigrationreform gives immigrants free cell phones is false & reckless,\" he said.\n\nWe were immediately dubious that the legislation said any such thing. The old \"Obamaphones\" rumor, for example, has been widely debunked. President Barack Obama never started a program to give out free cell phones to his supporters. Instead, he inherited a longstanding federal program that subsidizes phone service for the poor, including cellphone service. And the Federal Communications Commission under Obama\u2019s watch has moved to put more restrictions on the program to prevent fraud and waste.\n\nSo it was an easy call to take a look at the legislation and check out the \"Marcophones\" rumor for ourselves.\n\nOne quick clue that the rumor was off-base: The section that allegedly authorizes the free phones, Section 1107, is part of the bill\u2019s Title I, which has to do with border security.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill authorizes a program to \"improve emergency communications in the Southwest Border region.\" It creates grants for people who can prove they work and live in the region and are \"at greater risk of border violence due to the lack of cellular service at his or her residence or business and his or her proximity to the Southwest border.\"\n\nThe bill specifically mentions grants should be for satellite phones that \"provide access to 911 service and are equipped with global positioning services.\"\n\nAfter the blogosphere lit up with the rumor, Rubio said in a statement that the program was put forward in response to the death of an Arizona rancher, Robert Krentz. Intruders attacked Krentz on his property near the U.S.-Mexico border in 2010. His murder remains unsolved.\n\n\"Attempts to track Krentz's location using GPS from his cell phone were unsuccessful. Verizon had trouble getting a \u2018ping' signal possibly due to sparcity of cell towers in the area,\" said a report from News 4 Tucson.\n\nIn the weeks after Krentz\u2019s death, then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., sent letters to the major wireless carriers asking them to improve cell phone service in the border area.\n\n\"It is evident that the lack of reliable electronic communications is a factor in the growing public safety problem faced by area residents,\" Giffords wrote on April 9, 2010. \"It also contributed to a delay in the search for Mr. Krentz once he was reported missing and in the coordination of an immediate hunt for his killer who was able to escape into Mexico.\"\n\nPolitiFact reached Javier Manjarres, managing editor of the Shark Tank blog. He said the blog highlighted the communications grants because the language of the bill seemed ambiguous.\n\n\"Obviously, the bill doesn\u2019t say only immigrants are getting them. We\u2019re saying it because, hey, it could happen down the road, and the bill is so vague,\" he said.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the bill authorizes the program in broad outlines and doesn\u2019t set out specific criteria. But the bill also says the program will be administered by the secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the governors of the Southwest border states. This means the secretary would have the authority to set up eligibility criteria. And that criteria would have to promote the goal of border security, not welfare for new immigrants.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBloggers charge that new immigration legislation includes \"a taxpayer funded cellular phone\" for new immigrants. Their evidence is based on something else entirely: a public safety program aimed at beefing up border security.\n\nThe bill includes grants aimed at helping American ranchers and others in remote locations along the border get satellite phone service so they can be in touch with authorities. And Rubio can point to a well-documented case in which a rancher was killed on his property, and authorities said better phone service would have made a difference in speeding up their response to the case.\n\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09443"}
