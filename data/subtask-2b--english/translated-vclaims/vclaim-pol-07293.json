He says New Hampshire has lost more jobs in China than any other state.", "text": "As election day approaches, the New Hampshire Senate race has become prominent at the national level. With polls showing the competition between the current Democratic Jean Shahin and the Republican challenger Scott Brown is closer than ever, both candidates -- and their independent allies -- A declaration issued on 15 September 2014 by the majority party in the Senate, an independent, democratically biased group, targeted Brown for his alleged support for outsourcing employment. \"New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than to any other state,\" the novelist says. The accompanying narrative was visible, saying, \"The NH has lost more jobs to China than to any other country.\" Given that New Hampshire ranks only 42 of the 42 largest countries in the population, this claim seems strange. So we decided to take a look. The majority party in the Senate did not respond to any investigation, but we found the article by the leader of the Federation mentioned in the Declaration. The study covered the publication of the Institute for Economic Policy, a liberal Washington-based group, in 2012. It should be noted that the authors warned that \"it is not a statistical survey of actual jobs acquired or lost in individual companies, or the opening or closing of certain production facilities.\" Instead, the group fed federal trade and employment data into a mathematical model to estimate the number of jobs replaced by trade with China between 2001 and 2011. So what did you find out about the study? It found that New Hampshire ranked first among the 50 states in the estimated number of jobs lost by China - as a percentage of the state workforce. This language is similar to that of advertising, but not similar to that of advertising. The announcement spoke of the number of jobs, not of jobs as a percentage of the workforce. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women have got a job.\" By Nusiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021 if you measure job losses by raw number rather than percentage of the labour force, New Hampshire, a relatively small country, is at the bottom of the list. New Hampshire is linked to 29 of the 50 mandates included in the list of estimated job losses. On the list of provinces of Congress in the report, there are no provinces in New Hampshire ranked among the top 20 provinces nationwide in terms of estimated job losses in China. We will conclude by indicating that the headline of the Federation was correct, but the advertising version of that title eventually dropped four key words. The article says, \"NH has lost more jobs in China than in any other state, 2.94% of the total workforce.\" Our rule is that the majority in the Senate declares that \"New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than to any other state.\" First, the announcement did not note that this was an estimate rather than a large number of actual jobs lost by China. Second, it was estimated that New Hampshire lost the largest percentage of its workforce - not most jobs - to China. We have no disagreement with the use of labour force percentages as a criterion for this comparison, as doing so makes it possible to compare 50 states with different populations. However, the distinction between jobs and the percentage of the workforce should have been reflected in the declaration. Otherwise, it makes the declaration claim sound stronger than it is. The claim is partially accurate but leaves important details, so we evaluate it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07293"}
