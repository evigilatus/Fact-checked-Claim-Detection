There were only 10 states in that group. Texas ranked No. 1, with an increase of 545,900 jobs, from about 9.93 million to about 10.47 million. The other nine states, ranging in size from Louisiana to Wyoming, had a combined jobs increase of 183,700.\n\nHowever, that's not to say jobs weren\u2019t lost in Texas during those years. Employment numbers fluctuate. At the state\u2019s most recent peak, in August 2008, Texas had about 10.64 million jobs. About a year later, with the recession in full swing, Texas had about 400,000 less.\n\nNext, we asked the Texas Workforce Commission about the foundation\u2019s claim. Lisa Givens, an agency spokeswoman, sent us a 50-state comparison of job growth also using monthly BLS figures. However, Givens\u2019 accounting covered a more recent five-year period, March 2006 to March 2011 \u2014 numbers for which were still preliminary. Nine states, including Texas, had more jobs in March 2011 than in that month five years earlier. And Texas\u2019 gains far outpaced the combined total for the other states: 539,500 vs. 134,400.\n\nSo, the foundation\u2019s figures stand up \u2014 in the way that such figures are often analyzed, including by PolitiFact.\n\nUnsaid is that this gauge defines job creation as a net increase in employment. That means the foundation\u2019s analysis only takes into account the number of jobs created in excess of the number lost over a five-year period.\n\nBut new jobs also sprung up in the other 40 states, although they were offset by greater losses. Is it fair to assess job creation without including them?\n\nWe\u2019ve gone back and forth on that question.\n\nIn September 2010, we rated True the statement by Gov. Rick Perry that Texas had \"created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined.\" To come up with that number, Perry\u2019s campaign also looked at net job growth, although over a longer time period: January 2001 to June 2010.\n\nDuring our research of the Perry statement, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, told us that the governor\u2019s statement was correct. We touched base with her again on the foundation\u2019s TV statement, which she said has a legitimate basis.\n\nHowever, in January 2010, we rated False a statement from Perry that \"approximately 70 percent of the jobs created in the U.S. from November 2007-2008 were in Texas.\" We found that the Texas Workforce Commission, like the Texas Public Policy Foundation, had restricted its comparison to the states that experienced a net increase in employment; during the specified time period, there were 14 total, including Texas.\n\nWhile we researched that item, Michael Brandl, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, told us that excluding all those states with net job losses \u2014 and disregarding any jobs gained in those states \u2014 exaggerates the Texas share of total new jobs in the U.S.\n\n\"To say it's misleading is to be kind,\" Brandi said. \"It's just not true.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Truth-O-Meter score so far: one ruling that favors net increases in employment as a valid gauge of job creation \u2014 and one that doesn\u2019t.\n\nSeeking more clarity, we turned to Jason Faberman, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has written an article on the BLS data sources. He agreed that it could be misleading to consider only net increases in jobs as \"job creation.\" But, he said, the public is accustomed to hearing it discussed that way.\n\n\"When most policy, political and media people refer to jobs \u2018created\u2019 or \u2018added,\u2019 they are referring to the net gain in employment over some period,\" Faberman said.\n\nGivens, at the workforce commission, told us that when the agency refers to net employment gains, it says jobs were added rather than created.\n\nWhat happens if you look at total jobs created, not just the net gain? Then Texas is no longer No. 1. The BLS keeps annual data, starting from April 1 each year, on total private sector job gains and losses. During the most recent three years \u2014 2008, 2009 and 2010 \u2014 California gained an average of 1.3 million jobs annually, while Texas posted an average of 935,000 jobs. However, California also lost an average of 1.8 million jobs while Texas lost 992,000.\n\nHowever, Abbot cautioned that gross job numbers generally reflect a state\u2019s population, meaning that big states would post bigger numbers than small ones. \"There\u2019s no way that a Kansas could compare with a Texas,\" Abbot said.\n\nFaberman agreed that comparing gross job gains isn\u2019t the best way to fact-check the foundation\u2019s statement. Instead, he suggested comparing Texas\u2019 net employment change with that of the whole country, minus Texas\u2019 share. What we found: In January 2011, the United States, excluding Texas, had 5.3 million fewer jobs than it did in January 2006 \u2014 the five-year period used by the foundation. That compares with the 545,900 increase that Texas experienced during that time.\n\nSo, by Faberman\u2019s measure, Texas outperformed the rest of the country.\n\nWe came across another way of thinking about job creation in an Aug. 24 blog on the Houston Chronicle\u2019s website. According to the post, an unidentified economist noted that any \"raw job count would naturally favor\" Texas in a comparison with other net-gain states and asked what would happen if the size of the states\u2019 job forces were factored in. The Chronicle did that by calculating the percentage increase in the states\u2019 jobs between July 2009 and July 2010, and Texas still came out on top \u2014 but barely.\n\nInspired by the Chronicle, we looked again at the 10 states with net job gains over the last five years. Texas\u2019 gains represented a 5.5 percent increase in employment from January 2006 to January 2011. For the nine other states, their total increase of 183,700 jobs was a 2.5 percent increase.\n\nHowever, comparing the states individually, two had larger percentage increases than Texas: North Dakota (10.6 percent) and Alaska (5.7 percent).\n\nAnother factor that changes \u2014 even reverses \u2014 the job creation numbers is the time frame. The longer the time frame, the better Texas\u2019 numbers look. Comparing employment in a single month in 2006 with the same month five years later, Texas\u2019 job numbers grow. Shorten the time period to three years, and Texas shows a net loss in jobs, going from 10.56 million jobs in January 2008 to 10.47 million in January 2011.\n\nSo what\u2019s our (latest) ruling on job creation?\n\nThe foundation\u2019s claim that Texas \"created more jobs than all other states combined\" stands up \u2014 considering only those states that had net job gains over five years. That\u2019s the methodology usually used to define job creation in public discourse.\n\nBut the foundation\u2019s analysis disregards the 40 states where millions of jobs were created but were outnumbered by losses. And looking at the percentage increase in jobs relative to the size of each state\u2019s work force \u2014 another telling statistic \u2014 two other states experienced greater gains than Texas.\n\nWe rate the foundation\u2019s statement as Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13025"}
