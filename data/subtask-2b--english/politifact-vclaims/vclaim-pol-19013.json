A few days later, a similar allegation was leveled at her running mate, presidential candidate Joe Biden.\u00a0\n\"Biden said today, if he loses, his people will keep burning, looting and killing,\" an Aug. 31 Facebook post says. \"He said it.\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nHe did not say this. On Aug. 31, Biden was in Pittsburgh, where he gave a campaign speech on public safety and law enforcement. You can watch the video on C-SPAN, which said that Biden \"condemned the rioting and looting taking place around the country and blamed President Trump for the increase in violence.\"\u00a0\nWe watched the speech \u2014\u00a0you can also read the transcript here \u2014\u00a0and Biden didn\u2019t threaten that if he loses, \"his people\" will continue to burn, loot and kill.\u00a0\nRather, he commented on \"the senseless violence of looting and burning.\" Here\u2019s what else he said on the subject:\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want to make absolutely clear, so I am going to be very clear about all of this. Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It\u2019s lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted. Violence will not bring change, it will only bring destruction. It\u2019s wrong in every way.\"\n\n\n\"Fires are burning, and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames. We must not burn, we have to build. This president, long ago, forfeited any moral leadership in this country. He can\u2019t stop the violence because for years he fomented it. \u2026 Does anyone believe there\u2019ll be less violence in America if Donald Trump is re-elected?\"\n\n\n\"I want a safe America, safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops. Let me be crystal clear \u2014\u00a0safe from four more years of Donald Trump. I look at this violence because I see lives and communities and dreams of small businesses being destroyed and the opportunity for real progress on issues of race and police reform and justice being put to the test. Donald Trump looks at this violence and he sees a political lifeline. Having failed to protect this nation from the virus that has killed more than 180,000 Americans so far, Trump posts an all-caps tweet, screaming \u2018LAW AND ORDER,\u2019 to save his campaign.\"\n\n\nBiden accused Trump of mishandling the demonstrations that have roiled the country, saying that the president \"adds fuel to every fire because he refuses to even acknowledge that there\u2019s a racial justice problem in America.\"\nHe also contrasted how he would lead as a president.\u00a0\nHe never said \"his people will keep burning, looting and killing\" if he loses the election.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19013"}
