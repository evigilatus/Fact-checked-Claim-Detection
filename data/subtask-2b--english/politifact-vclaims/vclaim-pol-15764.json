But we can't resist using our Flip-O-Meter to record such a complete reversal of position.\n\n\nArlen Specter, the senior senator from Pennsylvania, was a moderate Republican, and one of only three Republican senators to vote for the economic stimulus bill that passed in February 2009.\n\n\nBut many moderates in Pennsylvania have jumped ship. In the 2008 election, about 200,000 Pennsylvania Republicans became Democrats, many so they could vote in the hotly contested Democratic primary between Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton.\n\n\nThis meant that as Specter looked to re-election next year, his prospects for beating a more conservative challenger\u00a0\u2014 Pat Toomey, a former congressman who headed the free-market, antitax Club for Growth \u2014 were looking pretty bad.\n\n\nYet Specter had ruled out switching parties, until ... Well, let's look at the evidence.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

I am not prepared to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate decided by the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate ... . But I'm prepared today take on all comers \u2014 all comers \u2014 in a general election. And therefore, I have decided to be a candidate for re-election in 2010 in the Democratic primary.\"\n\n\nSome of our rulings require a lot of time spent gathering evidence and a finely calibrated review of tricky points.
