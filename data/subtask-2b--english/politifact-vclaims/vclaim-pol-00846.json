The people who count the votes decide everything.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nPlenty of other places cite Stalin as the person who said this, but we couldn\u2019t find any credible, original sources explaining the attribution. So we reached out to the Stalin Digital Archive, an electronic database of documents and images that resulted from a collaboration between the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History and Yale University Press.\nA search of the archive didn\u2019t find any matching quotes, the archive\u2019s support staff told PolitiFact in an email. But because most of the archive\u2019s contents are images, it\u2019s possible that the quote eluded the query.\nNext, we reached out to some members of the archive\u2019s editorial board for insight. J. Arch Getty, a history professor at UCLA, told us he doesn\u2019t think Stalin said this.\n\"I am not aware of any original source for this, and in my extensive archival research in Stalin\u2019s personal archive, I found nothing like this,\" Getty said. \"There are many apocryphal quotes wrongly attributed to Stalin, and I think this is one of them.\"\nJames Harris, a senior lecturer in modern European history at the University of Leeds, agreed the attribution seemed suspect.\n\"Almost certainly apocryphal,\" Harris said in an email.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRon Suny, a professor of social and political history at the University of Michigan, said he had never seen or heard the quotation before.\n\"Many things that are attributed to Stalin are false,\" he said. \"I would not attribute this to him.\"\nBut Mark Kramer, director of the Cold War studies program at Harvard University, pointed us to something close. In memoirs written after his retirement, Boris Bazhanov, Stalin\u2019s former personal secretary, claimed that Stalin said: \"\u042f \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c; \u043d\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0432\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0430.\" It translates to: \"I regard it as completely unimportant who in the party will vote and how, but it is extremely important who will count the votes and how.\"\nBazhanov said Stalin was talking about the voting procedures for higher organs of the Communist Party, according to Kramer.\n\"There is no way to know for sure whether he is accurately recounting Stalin\u2019s words, if Stalin in fact said such a thing,\" Kramer said. \"Hence, I regard this as a statement attributed to Stalin by his former secretary Boris Bazhanov.\"\nDavid Brandenberger, an associate history professor at the University of Richmond, said Bazhanov fled the Soviet Union in 1928 and then published his \"rather unreliable muckraking memoir in 1930.\"\n\"Most experts consider Bazhanov\u2019s Stalin quotation to be apocryphal,\" he said.\nAnother version of this so-called Stalin quote,\u00a0as Brandenberger called it, is: \"In the bourgeois countries, it is not important how they vote, but how they do the counting.\"\nSome say Stalin was quoting Napoleon III, Brandenberger said, but there\u2019s no authentic record showing this.\nWe rate this Facebook post as False.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2019-04-02 15:30:46 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Joseph Stalin said, \"It is enough that the people know there was an election.
