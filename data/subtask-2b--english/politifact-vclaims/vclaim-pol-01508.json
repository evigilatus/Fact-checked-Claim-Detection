No.", "text": "A new campaign ad in the North Dakota Senate race claims Republican contender Kevin Cramer gave himself a five-figure raise as a public official.\n\"Could you give yourself a $23,000 raise?\" the ad voiceover says. \"Ask Kevin Cramer. On the Public Service Commission, he raised his pay to over $93,650.\"\nCramer did get raises totalling that amount. But the ad completely distorts Cramer\u2019s hand in securing the pay increase.\nThe Public Service Commission has three commissioners who are elected to six-year terms. They regulate utilities, pipeline safety, telecommunications, railroads and other state services.\nCramer joined the commission in August 2003. He served until the end of 2012, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.\nCommissioners\u2019 salaries usually originate from the governor\u2019s office, which works with the Office of Management and Budget to determine how much money is available for public officials, according to Jeff Larshus, director of state financial services at the OMB.\nThe governor then submits a budget to the Legislative Assembly, which writes the salaries into statute and votes on their approval.\nSo saying Cramer raised his own salary ignores the arbiter of that salary.\nThe OMB proposed and received across the board salary hikes for elected officials every year between 2005 and 2012. These include the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, superintendent for public instruction, state auditor, state treasurer, and the tax,\u00a0insurance, public service and agriculture commissioners.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, they all got a 4 percent hike from their last salary number, determined in 2002. They got three more 4 percent hikes in 2006, 2007, and 2008, a 5 percent increase in 2009, another 5 percent increase in 2010, and then 3 percent in 2011 and again in 2012. While their salaries all differ, the percentage increases were equal across the board.\nThat\u2019s how Cramer\u2019s salary jumped from $69,874 to $95,611 from the time he was elected to the time he left office \u2014 a $25,737 increase.\n\"So did it go up considerably during that time frame?\" Larshus said. \"Yes. But it wasn\u2019t because the commissioner asked for the salary.\"\nCommissioners submit a budget to the OMB every two years. There, they can suggest compensation for commissioners. But staff at the Public Service Commission and at the OMB said they could not recall an instance in which they had requested salary bumps for commissioners.\nThe OMB had three of the four budget requests during which Cramer served and got salary hikes on file. Only one asked for equity funds to raise administrative staff salaries. But that does not include the commissioners, according to Jill Kringstad, Accounting Budget Specialist. She could not recall any\u00a0instances where commissioners' salary increases were included in budget requests.\nThe bottom line is that the legislative assembly needs to approve, write into law and vote on any proposed salaries for elected officials proposed by the OMB. These salary changes were all ultimately set by the legislature.\nHeitkamp\u2019s office said Cramer could have refused to accept the raises or requested lower salary numbers to the OMB. The current governor had to change a North Dakota statute in order to fulfill his campaign promise to refuse pay.\nOur ruling\nHeitkamp said, \"Could you give yourself a $23,000 raise? Ask Kevin Cramer. On the public service Commission, he raised his pay to over $93,650.\"\nCramer\u2019s salary increased by $25,737 during his tenure on the Public Service Commission. But he didn\u2019t give himself that raise. The governor proposed it, the OMB drafted it, and the legislative assembly voted on its passage. The other 12 elected officials in North Dakota received the same percentage salary bump.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-10-08 14:15:29 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says \"On the Public Service Commission, (Kevin Cramer) raised his pay to over $93,650.\"    Heidi Heitkamp U.S. Senator from North Dakota https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cwfJYOQok   In a campaign ad Wednesday, September 26, 2018 2018-09-26    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01508"}
