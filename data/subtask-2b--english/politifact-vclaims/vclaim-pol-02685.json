The news outlet described the message as a \"robocall\" and said \"at least one person in our viewing area\" received the message. (They did not respond when we asked how many people had received the call.)\n\"Hi, this is Bernie Bernstein, I\u2019m a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5,000 and $7,000 dollars,\" the message stated.\nThe caller then said the newspaper \"will not be fully investigating these claims\" but would make a written report, and said he could be contacted via email at [email\u00a0protected]\nThis voicemail smelled fishy to us \u2014 so we decided to investigate further. It turns out the call was a hoax that appears calculated to undermine the work of real journalists.\nVoicemail comes on heels of Washington Post report\nThe suspicious voicemail comes as top Republicans call for Moore to end his bid in the Dec. 12 special election after the Washington Post reported that Moore, while in his 30s, had sexual encounters with several teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl, according to the women. Since then, another accuser has alleged that Moore assaulted her in locked car when she was 16.\nMoore\u2019s attorney, Trenton Garmon, seized on the phone call during a Nov. 15 appearance on MSNBC and floated the possibility of pursuing legal action.\n\"Robocalls are now even being made asking for people to come forward against Roy, which I think is kind of an indication of the political climate that we're in, and we plan on even probably getting into some depositions related to that,\" said Garmon, who acknowledged that he did not know who was responsible for making the call.\nWashington Post's\u00a0denial\nIt\u2019s unclear what relationship, if any, the voicemail bears to the Nov. 9 Washington Post report concerning Moore\u2019s alleged sexual encounters.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for his part, Moore forcefully denied the allegations and threatened to sue the Post after their bombshell investigation led top Republicans to call for Moore\u2019s exit.\n\"The Washington Post published another attack on my character and reputation because they are desperate to stop my political campaign,\" he said at a Nov. 12 campaign speech in Huntsville, Ala. \"These attacks said I was with a minor child and are false and untrue -- and for which they will be sued.\"\nThe Moore campaign did not respond to our request to comment on this story.\nWashington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron dismissed the voicemail as an effort to \"discredit real journalism,\" saying the reporting methods described in the call bear \"no relationship to reality.\"\n\"The Post has just learned that at least one person in Alabama has received a call from someone falsely claiming to be from The Washington Post,\" Baron said in a written statement. \"The call\u2019s description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality. We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism.\"\nThe Washington Post further noted in a Nov. 15 article that no Post newsroom employees are named \"Bernie Bernstein\" or \"Al Bernstein.\" Additionally, Moore, the pastor who received the voicemail, told WKRG that his attempt to email the address provided in the message came back undeliverable. (The same was true of our efforts.)\nOur ruling\nA caller purporting to be a Washington Post reporter named Bernie Bernstein left a voicemail saying the newspaper was offering women up to $7,000 for damaging information on Roy Moore.\nThe Washington Post denied having made the call and dismissed it as an effort to discredit journalism. Further, it said the reporting methods described in the call \u2014 offering cash in exchange for muck \u2014 runs counter to Post practice.\nWe found no record of any Washington Post reporters or editors named Bernie Bernstein or Al Bernstein, and emails sent to the address provided in the message came back undeliverable.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02685"}
