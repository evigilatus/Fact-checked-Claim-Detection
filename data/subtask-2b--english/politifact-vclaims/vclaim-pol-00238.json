It goes on to claim that the dispatcher will ask if the caller knows they\u2019re calling 911.\u00a0\n\"Say yes,\" it says, \"and continue pretending you\u2019re making an order. They\u2019ll ask if there\u2019s someone in the room. You can ask how long it will take for the pizza to get to you, and they will tell you how far away a patrol unit is. Share this to save a life!!! Dispatchers are trained to ask specific yes or no questions..don\u2019t hang up!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThat\u2019s because it\u2019s not accurate, even though it\u2019s been repeated often in recent years.\u00a0\nIn 2014, a Reddit user who said they were a 911 operator published a post that said a woman called 911 and ordered a pizza because she was in the room with someone who couldn\u2019t know she was reporting an emergency.\nIn 2015, a Super Bowl ad designed to raise awareness about domestic violence depicted a 911 call in which a woman orders a pizza while a camera cuts to different rooms in the house that are in disarray.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Do you have an emergency or not?\" the dispatcher in the ad says.\n\"Yes,\" the woman replies.\u00a0\nBut the claims in the Facebook post are wrong. Back in March 2018, many media outlets reported that police were warning people not to follow this advice.\u00a0\nThe Los Angeles Police Department tweeted in March 2018 that texting 911 with your exact location and the nature of your emergency \"is what\u2019s needed to send the right resources.\"\nThe post \"gives the impression that asking for a pepperoni pizza is somehow a \u2018secret code\u2019 to the 9-1-1 operator,\" LAPD said on Twitter. \"That is false. Operators are trained to recognize voice inflection, odd conversations that would indicate a dangerous situation, among other things.\"\u00a0\nSituations where someone needs to call 911 without another person in the room knowing aren\u2019t uncommon, according to LAPD, and texting is a good option in areas where it\u2019s available.\u00a0\n\"If a voice call is an absolutely must,\" the agency wrote, \"your options for discretion are not limited to ordering a pepperoni pizza.\"\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00238"}
