That\u2019s one way to tell.\nAnother way to check is to go on the website GovTrack.us. They have compiled a database with all of the bills considered, voted on and enacted.\nUsing this database, we searched all bills enacted during Obama\u2019s administration related to grandparents. There was no law that mandated grandparents to pick up their grandchildren every weekend.\nThe unknown author of this article made up the statement that said Obama signed a law that grandparents have to spend time with their grandchildren on the weekend, so we rate the statement as Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02814"}
