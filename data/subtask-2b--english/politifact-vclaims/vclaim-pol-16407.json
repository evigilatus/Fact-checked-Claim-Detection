(Edwards and Barack Obama do not.) We've previously checked his allegations\n\nhere\n\nthat she gets the most money from the health industry, pharmaceutical companies, health insurance companies and defense companies. He was mostly right on those claims.\n\nAt the Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Edwards charged Clinton with raising the most money from the oil and gas industry.\n\n\nBut Edwards is a bit off here. Clinton is No. 1 among Democrats, according to the latest data analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics.\n\n\nAnalyzing contributions from political action committees and individuals filed through Sept. 30, 2007, the center found the following totals from oil and gas companies:\n\n\n* Rudy Giuliani $545,058\n\n\n* Mitt Romney $309,933\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Hillary Clinton $220,550\n\n\n* John McCain $189,935\n\n\n* Barack Obama $106,112\n\n\n* Ron Paul $34,102\n\n\n* John Edwards $27,850\n\n\nSo it's true that Clinton has gotten significantly more than her Democratic rivals, but so far she's also been outraised by Republicans Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. For this reason, we give Edwards' statement only a Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16407"}
