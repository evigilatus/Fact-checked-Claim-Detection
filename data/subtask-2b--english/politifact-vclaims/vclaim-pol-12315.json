Chris Christie is a ray of sunshine in a dark and dreary world.\n\nA television ad broadcast in recent weeks by a group of Christie supporters paints that image of the governor, while touting his achievements of cutting spending and increasing education funding.\n\nFrom a group called the Committee for Our Children\u2019s Future, the ad begins with a hazy image of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. as the narrator intones: \"Runaway spending, record debt, gridlock government. Washington is backwards.\"\n\nThen suddenly, the video turns to an image of a sunrise with the narrator telling us who\u2019s responsible: \"But Chris Christie, with bipartisan support, is taking New Jersey (in) another direction.\"\n\nThe ad goes on to claim Christie \"cut spending (by) $1 billion\" and provided \"$850 million in new education funding.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found that the group\u2019s numbers are technically correct, but the picture is less sunny when you examine the education funding changes over the course of Christie\u2019s tenure.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that $1 billion in spending cuts.\n\nThe $1 billion in spending cuts mentioned in the ad refers to the line-item vetoes made by Christie in response to a $30.6 billion budget approved in June by the Democratic-controlled Legislature.\n\nWith his line-item vetoes, Christie reduced the fiscal year 2012 budget to nearly $29.7 billion. So the group is right that he cut spending by about $1 billion from what the Legislature had approved.\n\nDespite that decrease, the fiscal year 2012 budget is still larger than the fiscal year 2011 budget that Christie signed in June 2010. The fiscal year 2012 budget is about $1.3 billion greater than the fiscal year 2011 budget approved last year.\n\nDavid Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the state\u2019s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, said that $1.3 billion -- most of which represents a pension payment and increased school aid -- was made possible by higher-than-anticipated revenue growth in fiscal year 2011 and projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2012.\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn to the \"$850 million in new education funding\" mentioned in the ad.\n\nIn a previous ruling, we noted how the fiscal year 2012 budget increases education funding by about $863 million over the prior fiscal year. That figure supports the group\u2019s claim, but there\u2019s two problems with that argument.\n\nFirst, about half of that increased aid -- more than $446 million -- was required as part of a court order to go to the so-called Abbott districts. So Christie didn\u2019t have a choice about that money.\n\nSecondly, the fiscal year 2011 budget cut education aid by about $829 million. That means the new budget only represents a net increase of about $30 million.\n\nIn a Sept. 8 interview on an online radio show hosted by the New Jersey School Boards Association, Christie backs up that analysis:\n\n\"Yes, in my first year, we had to cut $820 million in funding from the public schools because we were in an enormous fiscal crisis. But the next year, this budget that I just signed...and advocated for, put an additional $850 million into the budget for public schools. So it paid back the entire cut from the year before of $820 million and added an additional $30 million on top of that.\"\n\nBrian Jones, a spokesman for Committee for Our Children\u2019s Future, defended both statements in an email.\n\n\"Christie did wind up cutting $1 billion in spending, as you note below, so I don\u2019t see how the statement can be seen as being false,\" Jones said. \"Again, Christie did wind up increasing education funding by $850 million this year. It\u2019s a true statement.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nA television ad from a pro-Christie group claims the governor \"cut spending (by) $1 billion\" and provided \"$850 million in new education funding.\"\n\nThose numbers are accurate, but when it comes to the education funding, Committee for Our Children\u2019s Future must think New Jerseyans only have short-term memory. Given the cuts made last year, education funding has gone up by a total of about $30 million since Christie\u2019s first budget in office.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12315"}
