The announcement starts with the narrator saying, \"Sheila Benom Coleman said...\" and he cuts into a tape of the candidate saying, \"We have to get the police out of school. He got the police out of school.\" Then the announcement shows four \"real mothers, not actresses,\" sitting at a kitchen table, carrying coffee cups and disagreeing with Phnom Coleman. The first woman says, \"That's scary.\" \"I don't want my children in an environment where they won't be safe.\" The second woman says the police are heroes. The third says that officers in schools are \"as an additional layer of protection.\" The fourth says, \"I just want my daughter to be safe.\" The announcement goes back to the first woman, who says, \"As a mother, I will not vote for Sheila Benom Coleman. I just don't.\" Through a lot of commercials, there's a kind on the screen that says, \"We need to get the police out of school - Sheila Benom Coleman.\" Beyond Coleman says Cox distorted her comments two years ago. We verified Cox &apos; s claim for publicity. The Declaration cites as its source the interview of Podcaste Benom Coleman by Marcello Rolando, Director of Performing Arts and a liberal activist, on 9 October 2017. Pinom Coleman asked for her ideas about \"school to prison pipeline,\" a disproportionate number of black students being expelled from school or arrested. In a long response, Benium Coleman said that many schools delegate routine school discipline to police and security guards at the site. She said, \"We have to get the police out of school,\" as Cox claims in his ad. But the ad deletes \"Penom Coleman,\" saying in her next breath, officers are required to provide safety. Here are her extensive remarks: Checking out the distinctive facts mentioned by Tony Evers on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We have put $330 million in public school aid - the largest amount in more than a decade.\" But now we have cops at school doing police work for our kids, you know we don't want kids to get into combat, we don't want them to go to class late, we don't want them to be broken in class, but do we want to send them to jail? \"I think there's an alternative here and I think we need to get the police out of school. The police must be there to take safety measures and ensure the safety of the school, not the imprisonment of children and the handling of disciplinary proceedings, which is what is happening.\" After a few minutes, Ben day Coleman said, \"I think the police should be there just to make sure that the school is safer and safer. They should not have any dealings with disciplinary procedures within the school.\" The director of the Benium Coleman campaign, Rob Silverstein, sent us an e-mail calling the Cox Declaration \"incredibly misleading and deceiving, giving a clear false impression of what she said. Parker Slaibo, spokesman for Cox, stood by the announcement. \"It's very difficult to be a distortion of Miss Benom Coleman, when the ad uses the recording of her own words,\" he said. \"We need to get the police out of school,\" says the Governor's Cox ad, \"sheila Benom Coleman. Byenom Coleman used these words in a lengthy answer to a question about \"the prison tube to school,\" which affects many black students. In the following sentence, however, she explained that the police \"need to be available\" to ensure that the school was safe, not to imprison children and to deal with disciplinary proceedings. In a few minutes, \"I think the police should be there just to make sure that the school is safe and secure. They should not have any dealings with disciplinary procedures within the school.\" Cox ignores this readily available context and, in an era of mass shootings, creates the misleading impression that Benam Coleman said she would leave schools unprotected. We appreciate Cox's claim that it is mostly false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00037"}
