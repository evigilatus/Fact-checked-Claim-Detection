Some claim this is proof Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 mask mandate isn\u2019t working, while others say it means we aren\u2019t taking the threat \u2014 or the mask mandate \u2014 seriously enough.\nBut the conservative MacIver Institute took another tack, zeroing in on the formula used to establish the positivity rate to claim that errors by the state Department of Health are what is actually causing the increase in that key measure.\n\"Bad Math Driving Wisconsin\u2019s Exploding Positive Test Rate,\" declared a Sept. 23, 2020, headline that was shared widely on social media.\nThe MacIver story went on to make a series of claims building on that thesis:\n\"A fundamental flaw in how the Evers\u2019 Administration calculates Wisconsin\u2019s daily COVID-19 positive test rate has excluded hundreds of thousands of test results and led to a wildly distorted picture of the state\u2019s progress in confronting the virus,\" said the story\u2019s first paragraph.\nIt later quoted Ryan Westergaard, DHS chief medical officer, as explaining the positivity rate is calculated by dividing the number of positive cases by the number of people tested \u2014 not the total number of tests.\nThe MacIver piece calls this a \"shocking admission.\"\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s only shocking if you haven\u2019t been paying close attention. This is how DHS has consistently calculated test positivity, and since mid-August the department has even explicitly laid this out in the COVID-19 dashboard.\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s an acceptable way \u2014 even the preferred way, by some \u2014 to do the calculation, since it weeds out multiple tests of the same person.\nHere\u2019s why this \"bad math\" claim is ridiculous.\nRate calculation hasn\u2019t changed amid spike\nThe most obvious error in this claim is blaming math for the \"exploding positive test rate.\"\nThe seven-day average of tests with positive results \u2014 a more reliable marker than daily totals since it smooths out daily jumps caused by changes in testing volume \u2014 rose slowly through August, from about 6% to 8%. It then spiked starting in September, pushing the seven-day average close to 20% by the end of the month.\nThe MacIver piece posits this is due to errant calculations. But this rate has been calculated the same way throughout this entire stretch.\nSo whatever one\u2019s objections to the methodology, if the same formula is used at the beginning and the end of a given time period, and the rate increases dramatically in that span, the increase is real.\nThe MacIver piece notes in its critique that test positivity is important because it\u2019s one of six so-called \"gating\" criteria Evers is using to shape state policy on the pandemic. If test positivity is being used incorrectly, that would make it harder to achieve the thresholds set by Evers, and for the state to reopen fully.\nTest positivity is, indeed, one of the criteria.\u00a0\nBut the MacIver implication that it lacks legitimacy falls flat. The criteria doesn\u2019t call for a specific percentage level to be met. Rather it calls for a downward trajectory for 14 days. And, as we noted, the same measuring stick \u2014 the formula \u2014 has been used throughout.\nState approach to test positivity is widely used, even preferred\nThat brings us to the heart of this claim, that DHS is using \"bad math\" in calculating the percentage of positive tests. The MacIver piece itself elaborates on this, asserting, \"If the goal is to calculate the daily positive test rate, then DHS is using the wrong numerator and denominator.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS calculates percent positivity by dividing the number of people with positive test results by the number of people tested in a given span. (Their dashboard includes daily counts as well as a seven-day and 14-day average.)\nThe MacIver piece asserts this is incorrect, saying the state should instead be basing the calculation off the raw number of tests, which would deliver a lower percentage.\nBut the state\u2019s approach is actually both widely used and preferred because it prevents people who are tested often from skewing the data.\u00a0\nThese aren\u2019t people who feel sick or exhibit symptoms and seek a test \u2014 the typical sort of person tested. Rather, these are people who are tested regularly based on their position (such as a front-line health care worker) or situation (such as living in a nursing home where an outbreak has occurred).\nCounting each of those negative test results would give an unrealistic picture of how frequently positive tests are occurring in the population \u2014 the core question all testing is trying to answer.\n\"Our data report individuals tested,\" Westergaard said in a June 11, 2020, media briefing. \"So, if an individual was tested more than once because they were being followed to see if they cleared the infection or if they were tested a couple times weeks apart, they would be considered a single case and not multiple cases in our data.\"\nJohns Hopkins University, which operates a COVID dashboard has become a go-to national resource in the pandemic, endorses this approach. Officials there said some places aren\u2019t using it only because their data doesn\u2019t allow them to break it down this way.\n\"We feel that the ideal way to calculate positivity would be number of people who test positive divided by number of people who are tested,\" says an explainer posted on the Johns Hopkins dashboard. \"We feel this is currently the best way to track positivity because some states include in their testing totals duplicative tests obtained in succession on the same individual, as well as unrelated antibody tests. However, many states are unable to track number of people tested, so they only track number of tests.\"\nThe CDC also notes this is a standard way of approaching test positivity calculations. Their website lists it as one of three formulas used by various agencies.\n\n\nThe CDC calculates positivity by dividing the number of positive tests by the total number of tests taken. It notes it only uses this approach because it doesn\u2019t have access to the data state and local health departments have to identify\u00a0 \u2014 and separate out\u00a0 \u2014 repeat tests from the same individual.\n\n\nSome states divide the number of people with positive tests by the total number of tests taken.\n\n\nSome states use Wisconsin\u2019s approach, dividing the number of people with positive tests by the number of people tested.\n\n\nThe New York Times \u2014 which also runs a \u00a0COVID dashboard\u00a0 \u2014 notes at least 18 states report tests like Wisconsin, based on the number of people tested, rather than the number of tests.\nNone of this national context was included in the MacIver piece.\nDHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said Sept. 29, 2020, the agency was in the process of launching an updated dashboard that shows test positivity calculated using both approaches \u2014 number of people and number of tests. She said both measures \"are informative to the response effort in Wisconsin.\"\u00a0\nOne more quick note for some general context on this metric.\nThe COVID Tracking Project, another dashboard operator, said in a Sept. 22, 2020, blog post that test positivity is useful but also \"one of the most commonly misunderstood metrics for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic.\" It notes percent positivity rates can vary greatly based on who officials decide to test.\n\"The choice of who gets tested is based on state- or county-specific criteria, but is often made based on how sick people appear to be, which in turn influences test positivity,\" the blog post said. \"If a state only tests people who have clear symptoms of the virus, it will likely have a higher test positivity than one that is also testing asymptomatic people.\"\nOur ruling\nA MacIver article widely shared on Facebook says \"bad math\" is to blame for Wisconsin\u2019s \"exploding positive test rate.\"\nThis is wrong on multiple fronts.They\u2019re asserting manipulated math is behind the increase in test positivity, but it\u2019s actually because the number of people testing positive has risen based on human behavior.\u00a0\nThere is no \"bad math.\" The state DHS uses a methodology (tallying people tested rather than raw tests) that is widely used by health agencies around the country. It is considered a more accurate approach because it assures people who are tested on a regular, even daily, basis \u2014 such as health care workers \u2014 don\u2019t skew the data.\nAnd whatever the quibbles with the methodology, this wouldn\u2019t cause the increase in the test positivity rate because the formula DHS used to calculate the rate was the same throughout the time period.\nThat makes this claim both false and ridiculous, or as we call it, Pants on Fire.\nNote: DHS updated their COVID-19 dashboard Sept. 30, the day after this story published, to include test positivity in terms of both tests and people. That does not affect the rating for this item since the per-person method remains on the DHS website and remains an acceptable and even preferred\u00a0approach.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19038"}
