However, their descriptions seem to reflect martial law at its most extreme: the suspension of civil authority and military control of civilian functions such as the courts.\u00a0\nPolitiFact spoke to six scholars of constitutional law and presidential power and asked them whether the executive order allows Trump to declare martial law.\u00a0\nThey were unanimous: It doesn\u2019t.\n\"There is literally nothing in the executive order that allows for any kind of use of military force where it isn\u2019t already authorized by statute,\" said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law and a leading expert in martial law.\u00a0\n\"The statutory authorities that the executive order invokes would not extend to declaring martial law,\" said Bernadette Meyler, a Stanford Law School professor.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s painful to hear about this theory, both because it\u2019s not based in fact and because it\u2019s dangerous to be thinking this way,\" said Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University.\nTheory rests on an inaccurate reading of an executive order\nThe 2018 executive order at the center of the claim allows the president to impose sanctions on foreign entities or individuals who have interfered in a U.S. election. It was signed amid reports that the Russian government had attempted to disrupt the 2016 U.S. election and help Trump\u2019s electoral efforts.\u00a0\n\"Basically, what (the executive order) does is allow people in the executive branch to impose economic sanctions on foreign actors interfering in the election,\" said Edelson. \"How you get from there to imposing martial law, I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\"\nThe president cannot unilaterally impose martial law\nAny executive order that gave the president the authority to unilaterally invoke martial law would be unconstitutional, the scholars we spoke with said.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The president has no ability to unilaterally authorize himself to impose martial law, just as he could not issue an executive order allowing himself to decide judicial cases or controversies,\" said Daniel Kobil, a law professor at Capital University Law School.\u00a0\nUnder Article II of the Constitution, the president has no inherent authority to declare martial law except under the extreme circumstances of a rebellion or foreign invasion, said Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School.\u00a0\n\"Losing an election doesn\u2019t count as a basis for invoking this power,\" Feldman added.\u00a0\nIn 1866, the Supreme Court ruled in the case Ex parte Milligan that martial law cannot be imposed where civil courts are open and functioning. As a result, one should think of martial law as a state of affairs arising from a total breakdown of civil order, Vladeck said.\u00a0\n\"The president has a handful of statutory authorities to use the military for domestic law enforcement, but none of those authorities allow for the \u2018imposition\u2019 of martial law, versus using the military to restore order in situations in which civilian authorities are unable or unwilling to do so.\"\nThe last time the federal government imposed martial law was in Hawaii in 1941 after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\nEven if such conditions existed in a part of the U.S., the president would have to get congressional approval to use the military, said Joseph Nunn, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and author of an exhaustive study on martial law in America.\u00a0\n\"If the president and Congress disagree, Congress wins, unless the Constitution gives the president \u2018conclusive and preclusive\u2019 authority over the issue. And in the case of martial law, it\u2019s the opposite of conclusive and preclusive,\" Nunn said.\nAnd if a president attempted to unilaterally impose martial law to secure a second term for himself in the absence of an invasion or rebellion?\n\"We have a technical term for that,\" said Feldman. \"It\u2019s called a coup d\u2019etat. It would be criminal.\"\nOur ruling\nSocial media posts say that a 2018 executive order gives Trump the power to impose martial law.\u00a0\nSix scholars of constitutional law and presidential power told us that the executive order doesn\u2019t give the president the power to impose martial law.\u00a0\nUnder the Constitution, the president does not have the power to unilaterally impose martial law.\u00a0\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17301"}
