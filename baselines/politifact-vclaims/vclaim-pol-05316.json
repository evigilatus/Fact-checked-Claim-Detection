So I\u2019m not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board.\"\nWe were curious about Clinton\u2019s claim that Cleveland has it worse.\nIf you stopped listening there, you might have thought she was saying the tap water in Ohio\u2019s second-largest city is also contaminated with lead \u2014\u00a0which is not the case.\nLater in the debate, Clinton made a point of mentioning lead coming from other sources, too:\u00a0\"I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it's not only in water systems, it's also in soil, and it's in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes,\" she said.\nThe Clinton campaign cited an\u00a0article\u00a0in the\u00a0Cleveland Plain Dealer, and we found other reports and data that back her point.\nLead poisoning leads to serious neurological and behavioral effects ranging from shortened attention spans and developmental disabilities\u00a0to coma and even death.\nWhile no level of lead is safe in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a reference level of 5 micrograms of lead per one deciliter of blood as an indicator of higher-than-usual blood lead levels. According to the CDC, 2.5 percent of American children age 5 and under \u2014 about a half million kids \u2014 test at this level.\nResidents of Flint have been consuming tap water with lead since 2014, when the city switched its water source to the polluted Flint River to save money. In 2015, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas had elevated blood lead levels, according to an analysis by Monica Hanna-Attisha, a researcher at Flint\u2019s Hurley Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton has a point that many other American cities are dealing with the toxin. Lead-contaminated tap water has run through faucets in Washington D.C., Durham, N.C., Lakehurst Acres, Maine, Jackson, Miss. and other places throughout the years.\nBut in most places, lead poisoning elsewhere is mainly due to lead-based paint in older houses.\nThat\u2019s the case for Cleveland, where a whopping 14.2 percent of kids tested at the reference level in 2014, according to the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. In the county, 10.3 percent of kids had elevated blood levels.\nCleveland and Cuyahoga County aren\u2019t exactly outliers. Looking at 2014 CDC surveillance data for 1,425 counties in 29 states, 288 counties have higher rates of lead poisoning than Flint. (We should caution that the data is far from perfect; for example, 100 percent of kids in Colfax County, N.M., tested positive, but the sample size was just 33 kids.)\nWhat\u2019s more, 15 counties had the same percentage or higher rates of poisoned children as Flint, but at double the reference blood-lead level:\n\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint.\"\nIn Flint, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas in Flint tested positive for lead poisoning in 2015. In Cleveland, that rate was 14.2 percent in 2014.\nHowever, the lead in Cleveland came from paint, not water, and Clinton's initial\u00a0phrasing made that unclear.\u00a0With this caveat, we rate Clinton's claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05316"}
