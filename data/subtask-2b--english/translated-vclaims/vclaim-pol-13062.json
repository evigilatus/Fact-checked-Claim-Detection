We need more American energy.\" Williams adds on his campaign website: \"If I don't know better, I think President Obama is actually trying to see what petrol looks like for five dollars.\" And apart from energy policy, did Williams link the exact price of gas to Obama's watch? After we left Williams' message, we dug to change prices since Obama took office in 2009 and during the previous presidency. First, from a simple perspective: Presidents can't do anything to reduce gas prices in the short term, he recently told an energy policy expert at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota WCO-TV in Minneapolis. On April 27, the station quoted from Associate Professor Elizabeth Wilson that the United States did not have much control over prices because \"oil is an international commodity, a substitute commodity, traded in international markets.\" The Presidents could benefit from the country &apos; s strategic oil reserves, which President George W. Bush did in 2005, causing oil prices to fall by 10 per cent. But, Wilson said, \"You can argue that high prices, despite the pain, are not possible strategic reasons to drain reserves.\" Or, she said, the president could go after speculators who blame some for paying for the rise in the price of oil. The speculative energy contracts have increased by 35% since the unrest began in Egypt in January; the government can limit the number of contracts that major players can buy, although Wilson said that this is unlikely to have a direct impact on pump prices. The prices of gas have attracted Obama's attention. On May 14, in his weekly radio address, he said: \"There is no doubt that one of the greatest burdens of the past few months has been the price of gasoline.\" He had been requesting various government movements, including annual rental sales in the Alaska National Oil Reserve to expedite the assessment of oil and gas resources in the central and southern Atlantic. How much gas prices have increased since Obama's inauguration on January 20, 2009? In that week, the average price per gallon of non-lead gas in Texas was $1.72, according to AAA, which follows prices at the pump by daily surveying over 100,000 self-service gas stations. It was $3.77 a week from Williams' tweet - up to $2.05. This price was still shy from the July 2008 average of $3.97, the highest average for Texas during the presidency of his predecessor, George W. Bush, an increase of $2.55 over the week that Bush began his first term in 2001. In his first two years plus -- the same period as Obama's place today -- the average price of every Texas gallon of non-lead gas has barely shifted, and the average price of every gas in the world has been reduced. After that, we examined national retail prices for all the gas formulations published on the Internet for environmental impact assessment. From mid-August 1990, this information indicates that these prices rose by less than 10 cents in the similar part of Bill Clinton's presidency and about 10 cents in the corresponding part of George W. Bush's first term - compared to some $2.10 for Obama. Another environmental impact assessment chart shows the annual prices of non-lead gas on the five former Obama Presidents. After the 2005 dollar adjustment, the national price rose from $1.74 to $2.06 in the first three years of Jimmy Carter &apos; s presidency; from $2.64 to $2.15 in that part of Ronald Reagan; and from $1.47 to $1.53 for George H.W. Bush; $1.42 to $1.41 for Clinton; and $1.61 to $1.69 for Bush II. We then asked about the relationship of cause/effect involved in the Williams Statement. This, is it fair to hold any head responsible for the price of gas in the pump? The United States Department of Energy Information calls the price of crude oil \"the main contributor to the overall price increase in petrol retail since the beginning of 2009.\" Its 22 March publication contains several factors affecting crude oil prices, including political events in the Middle East and North Africa, shifts in stock levels, gradual improvements in the world &apos; s economies and a decline in the profits earned by petrol refineries. Regardless, presidents are historically blamed when gas prices rise, and they are not necessarily rewarded when gas prices fall, according to the Bloomberg Business Week story of May 2006. It is reported that the price problem in the pumps \"boiled the bosses at least since 1973, when the Arab oil embargo established gas lines, prices escalated by about 55 cents per gallon, and an additional headache for President Richard Nixon. Of course, rising prices are not the only reason for the fall in presidential popularity. Relationship is an interrelationship, and other factors contribute to the general perceptions of the President.\" Our share? Gas costs more than $2 per gallon than it did when Obama took office; in the past 35 years, no other president has experienced such price increases because of this point in his tenure. However, Williams errs in pointing out that the President is wrong; the main factors that drive gas prices are beyond the President &apos; s control. We evaluate the statement half right. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. \u2022 January 29, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13062"}
