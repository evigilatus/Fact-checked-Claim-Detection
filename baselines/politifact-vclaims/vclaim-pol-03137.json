They emit frequencies that do everything from unlocking doors to logging onto computers, removing the need to turn a key or flip a switch.\nWhile it\u2019s true some people have voluntarily been implanted, there\u2019s not a shred of evidence to support the absurd notion that the\u00a0procedure is mandatory in Australia, as this story claims.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fake item appears to be a gross distortion of a puff piece from an actual Australian media outlet about an entrepreneur from Sydney who runs a business implanting microchips in customers\u2019 skin.\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that the tech entrepreneur or her chip-implanting business are acting on behalf of the government of Australia, or that customers sought her service because a government policy requires them to do so.\nThis bogus item follows a familiar fake news formula, wending its way from a shocking, clickbait-y headline, through muddled reasoning that attempts to support an ultimately untenable central premise.\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03137"}
