The term \"benefits\" has been used in relation to the program\u2019s disbursements since it began in the 1930s.\nThe post displays a photo of a Social Security card with \"1946 - 1964,\" which signifies the time period in which the baby boomer generation was born. Accompanying the image is a long string of text that\u2019s been circulating the internet in one form or another in email chains since at least 2012.\u00a0\nPart of that text says: \"The government is now referring to our Social Security checks as a \u2018Federal Benefit Payment.\u2019 This isn't a benefit. It is our money paid out of our earned income! Not only did we all contribute to Social Security but our employers did too.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The term is also applied to other government programs, such as Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare.\nWe also could find no information on the Social Security Administration\u2019s website that says\u00a0 disbursements are being officially re-classified.\u00a0\nThe rest of the text is filled with inaccurate calculations and assumptions about how Social Security contributions work. (For example, it says Social Security contributions total \"15% of our income before taxes\" and uses the figure to make various calculations. But, besides the fact that the rate has varied over the years, Social Security contributions for employees and employers isn\u2019t, and has never been, 15%. The current rate is 12.4%, with 6.2% paid by the employee and 6.2% paid by the employer.)\nOur ruling\nA social media post says that the government is reclassifying Social Security checks as\u00a0 \u2018federal benefit payments.\"\nThere is no new designation for the disbursements. Social Security checks have always been considered federal benefit payments.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17487"}
