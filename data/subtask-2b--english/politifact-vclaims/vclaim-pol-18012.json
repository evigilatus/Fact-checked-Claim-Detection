Kamala Harris issued a bold threat to supporters of President Donald Trump.\nHarris is said to be on Joe Biden\u2019s short list of potential running mates in his bid for the presidency.\n\"Who the hell does she think she is?\" the post\u2019s headline reads. Below that is a photo of Harris alongside this text, which purports to quote her:\n\"And once Trump\u2019s gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorsed his actions, because we\u2019ll be coming for you next. You will feel the vengeance of a nation. No stone will be left unturned as we seek you out in every corner of this great nation. For it is you who have betrayed us.\"\nThe rest of the image claims Harris uttered the quote on June 18, 2020, and ends with: \"Yes, she really said this.\"\nNo, she really didn\u2019t.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe June 20 post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
