I\u2019d have to look it up,\" La Follette replied.\nUm.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook.

Arvina Martin, told the Capital Times when launching her campaign \"it may be time for some new ideas, new blood and someone with a different point of view.\"\nSo, just how long has La Follette held the secretary of state\u2019s job?\nNearly 40 years.\nFrom the official Wisconsin Blue Book\u2019s list of secretaries of state:\n\n\n\n\nDoug La Follette\n\n\n1975-1979\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVel Phillips\n\n\n1979-1983\n\n\n\n\nDoug La Follette\n\n\n1983-present\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, La Follette served four years before being replaced by Phillips, the only black person ever elected to statewide office in Wisconsin. That was when he ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor.\nAfter reclaiming the office by defeating Phillips in the 1982 election, La Follette has since served in the job for another 35.5 years and counting.\n(La Follette is more accurate about his time in office on his campaign website. He notes that he served as a state legislator for two years until 1974, and \"was then elected secretary of state and has been re-elected every four years for the past 30 years.\")\n\n\n\n\nAll our fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOver the years, the Legislature has gradually reduced the duties of the secretary of state. La Follette said in the interview his office once had 50 employees and now it\u2019s just him and one other full-time employee.\nThe winner of the La Follette-Martin race will face the winner of the two-way Republican primary in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election.\nSpencer Zimmerman of Janesville is campaigning to make the secretary of state\u2019s position Wisconsin\u2019s \"chief protocol officer for international relations,\" while Jay Schroeder of Neenah is campaigning to eliminate the office altogether.\nWhen we contacted La Follette about his statement, by the way, he said he would have to \"do a little calculation.\" Then later he emailed us, saying: \"Wow, I did some math. It looks like it is more like 40 years; let me say, time flies when you\u2019re having fun. Thanks for calling this to my attention.\"\nOur rating\nLa Follette says he\u2019s been Wisconsin secretary of state \"around 25 years.\"\nHe\u2019s held the job for a total of nearly 40 years.\nWe rate his statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01794"}
