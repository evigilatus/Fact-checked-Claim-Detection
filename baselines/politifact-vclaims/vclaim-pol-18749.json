The \"three red banners\" referred to three aspects of Chinese socialism: the Great Leap Forward, the General Line and the People\u2019s Commune.\n\"The purpose of the slogan \u2018Three Red Banners\u2019 was to help make China a strong and prosperous country in the shortest possible period by building \u2018socialism with Chinese characteristics,\u2019 that is, by avoiding certain limitations built into other nations\u2019 experiments with communist/socialist models,\" wrote X.L. Woo in \"Two Republics in China: How Imperial China Became the PRC.\"\nFacebook users say the three red stripes that make up the \"E\" in Biden\u2019s name in his campaign logo refer to this decades-old Chinese socialist slogan, which Woo wrote \"ended in failure.\" Biden\u2019s campaign says otherwise.\n\"The three red lines were inspired by the American flag, the red stripes on the American flag,\" a Biden campaign spokesperson told PolitiFact.\nThe rest of the Biden campaign\u2019s logo is blue and white, alluding to the other colors of the flag. We could find no other evidence that the three red stripes are intended to pay homage to China.\nThe post makes an inaccurate and ridiculous claim.
