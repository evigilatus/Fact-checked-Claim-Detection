Of the presidential Democrats who were in Congress at the time, only Ko\u0161ini\u0107 voted against the war decision. But to win the crown as the \"first\" -- whatever that means, and the Kusinich campaign won't explain -- is a more accurate privilege. Was he the first person? No. Was he the first congressman? No. Was he the first candidate for the presidency? No (Corrected Answer: Republican Ron Paul). Was he the first democratic presidential candidate? Yeah. According to Congress &apos; s record, Cleveland &apos; s Democratic Party spoke for the first time against the war in the context of Iraq in its remarks of 20 March 2002. He called for peace and warned against the slippage of nuclear weapons. (Paul said in November 29, 2001: \"The argument that Hussein (Saddam) produces weapons of mass destruction is the most donkey among all herrings, according to the Congress Register.\" On January 13, 2021, General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" According to Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, but Kusinich received the title of leader of the anti-war movement in late August 2002, after a wide-ranging briefing from Capitol Hill, where he called for more \"discussion on why we should not go to war,\" according to an article published in Cleveland Plane Clare. He then started building a congressional alliance against war. \"Unilateral military action by the United States against Iraq is unjustified, unjustified and illegal,\" as Kosini\u0107 said, according to The Washington Times on 20 September 2002. \"The Administration has failed to demonstrate that Iraq poses an imminent or immediate threat to the United States.\" His position as President of the opposition was reinforced on 3 October 2002, when he took the floor in the House of Representatives to present an eight-page analysis, point by point, that refuted the joint resolution on Iraq in the days preceding the vote.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00324"}
