He told conservative talk show host Jay Weber that Baldwin\u2019s \"philosophy is to spend as much money as possible and forget about the consequences of the next generation, the consequences of the declining dollar, the consequences of our debt load.\"\n\n\"In fact she is so liberal -- I don\u2019t know if people out there really know this -- she joined the Progressive Caucus, which introduced a budget that spent trillions -- not billions, trillions -- more money than the Obama budget.\" \u00a0\n\nIn the same vein, Thompson during the debate called Baldwin the House\u2019s \"number one spender\" and alluded to her support of \"increased spending\" with the Progressive Caucus budget.\n\nLet\u2019s see if Thompson\u2019s right about the trillions.\n\nThe caucus\n\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus, according to its website, consists of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, and 75 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Baldwin is a vice-chair of the group.\n\nThe caucus gained attention when U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., claimed in April 2012 that its members were members of the Communist Party. That rated a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact Florida, which confirmed through the Communist Party USA that no members of Congress are members of its party.\n\nThe fiscal 2012 budget proposed by the Progressive Caucus was what Thompson was referring to when he made his trillions more comment about Baldwin, Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe told us.\n\nThat plan, unveiled in April 2011, was offered as an alternative to budgets proposed by President Barack Obama and by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee.\n\nBaldwin did vote for the caucus budget, which was introduced as an amendment to Ryan\u2019s budget. The amendment failed in the House, 347-77.\n\nBudget comparisons\n\nThe Progressive Caucus budget would have spent $44.5 trillion from 2012 to 2021, according to an analysis done for the caucus by the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute.\n\nTo see how that compared with Obama\u2019s plan over 10 years, we contacted experts from two nonpartisan think tanks: Taxpayers for Common Sense, a government spending watchdog; and the Concord Coalition, which seeks balanced federal budgets.\n\nThey agreed that Obama\u2019s fiscal 2012 spending plan called for $46 trillion in spending.\n\nThat\u2019s $1.5 trillion more than the Progressive Caucus Budget.\n\nSo, Thompson was wrong when he said the Baldwin-backed caucus would spend \"trillions more\" than Obama\u2019s budget.\n\nThompson has said, in prepared statements before and after his radio interview, that the Progressive Caucus budget would have raised trillions more in taxes than Obama\u2019s budget. And our experts agreed the caucus budget would have collected $42 trillion in taxes over 10 years, some $5 trillion more than Obama\u2019s.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t Thompson\u2019s claim on the radio.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, raising taxes doesn\u2019t automatically mean a corresponding increase in spending. Indeed, The Economist magazine, among others, pointed out the Progressive Caucus budget would have reduced federal deficits more than both the Obama and Ryan budgets -- primarily because of its higher taxes and cuts in defense spending.\n\nOur rating\n\nThompson claimed Baldwin supported the Progressive Caucus budget, which he said spent \"trillions more\" than a budget from Obama.\n\nBaldwin did back the proposal, which would have raised taxes by trillions more than the president. But the caucus plan would have actually spent less money than the Obama plan.\n\nWe rate Thompson\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10248"}
