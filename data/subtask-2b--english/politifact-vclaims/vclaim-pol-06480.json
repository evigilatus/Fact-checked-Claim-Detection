They wrote that in there because they knew the danger of corrupting our system by foreign money is enormous,\" Gingrich said. \"You had a sitting secretary of state whose husband radically increased his speech fees, you have a whole series of dots on the wall now where people gave millions of dollars \u2014 oh, by the way, they happen to get taken care of by the State Department.\"\nHe continued, \"My point is they took money from foreign governments while she was secretary of State. That is clearly illegal.\"\nPunditFact wanted to know if a criminal case against Clinton is that open and shut. Is what happened \"clearly illegal\"?\nA spokesman for the Clinton Foundation certainly disagreed, calling Gingrich\u2019s accusation \"a baseless leap\" because Clinton was not part of her husband\u2019s foundation while serving as a senator or secretary of state. We did not hear from Gingrich by our deadline.\nFoundation basics\nFormer President Clinton started the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001, the year after Hillary Clinton won her first term as a New York senator. The foundation works with non-governmental organizations, the private sector and governments around the world on health, anti-poverty, HIV/AIDS and climate change initiatives. Spokesman Craig Minassian said it\u2019s reasonable for the foundation to accept money from foreign governments because of the global scope of its programs, and the donations are usually in the form of tailored grants for specific missions.\nHillary Clinton was not part of her husband\u2019s foundation while she was a senator or\u00a0secretary of state. Her appointment to the latter post required Senate confirmation and came with an agreement between the White House and Clinton Foundation that the foundation would be more transparent about its donors.\nAccording to the 2008 memorandum of understanding, the foundation would release information behind new donations and could continue to collect donations from countries with which it had existing relationships or running grant programs. If countries with existing contributions significantly stepped up their contributions, or if a new foreign government wanted to donate, the State Department would have to approve.\nClinton took an active role in fundraising when she left the State Department and the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013. But she left the board when she announced her run for the presidency in April 2015.\nThe Emoluments Clause\nSo how does Gingrich come up with the claim that Clinton Foundation donations are \"clearly illegal\" and unconstitutional?\nThe answer is something known as the Emoluments Clause. A few conservative websites have made similar arguments in recent days, including the Federalist blog. The Emoluments Clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads in part:\n\"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"\nThe framers came up with this clause to prevent the government and leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free of external influence. (An emolument, per Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is \"the returns arising from office or employment usually in the form of compensation or perquisites.\")\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLest you think the law is no longer relevant, the Pentagon ethics office in 2013 warned employees the \"little known provision\" applies to all federal employees and military retirees. There\u2019s no mention of spouses in the memo.\nJ. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Africa Center, said interpretation of the clause has evolved since its adoption at the Constitutional Convention, when the primary concern was about overseas diplomats not seeking gifts from foreign powers they were dealing with. The Defense Department memo, in his view, goes beyond what the framers envisioned for the part of the memo dealing with gifts.\n\"I think that, aside from the unambiguous parts, the burden would be on those invoking the clause to show actual causality that would be in violation of the clause,\" Pham said.\nExpert discussion\nWe asked seven different constitutional law experts on whether the Clinton Foundation foreign donations were \"clearly illegal\" and a violation of the Emoluments Clause.\nWe did not reach a consensus with their responses, though a majority thought the layers of separation between the foundation and Hillary Clinton work against Gingrich.\nThe American system often distinguishes between public officers and private foundations, \"even if real life tends to blur some of those distinctions,\" said American University law professor Steve Vladeck. Vladeck added that the Emoluments Clause has never been enforced.\n\"I very much doubt that the first case in its history would be because a foreign government made charitable donations to a private foundation controlled by a government employee\u2019s relative,\" he said. \"Gingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing. Unfortunately for him, for purposes of federal regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, they\u2019re formally \u2014 and, thus, legally \u2014 distinct.\"\nRobert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas constitutional law professor who worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel from 1989 to 2003, also called Gingrich\u2019s link between Clinton and the foreign governments\u2019 gifts to the Clinton Foundation as \"implausible, and in any case I don\u2019t think we have the facts to support it.\"\n\"The truth is that we establish corporate bodies like the Clinton Foundation because the law endows these entities with a separate and distinct legal personhood,\" Delahunty said.\nJohn Harrison, University of Virginia law professor and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel from 1990 to 1993, pointed to the Foreign Gifts Act, 5 U.S.C. 7432, which sets rules for how the Emoluments Clause should work in practice.\nThe statute spells out the minimal value for acceptable gifts, and says it applies to spouses of the individuals covered, but \"it doesn\u2019t say anything about receipt of foreign gifts by other entities such as the Clinton Foundation.\"\n\"I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s any other provision of federal law that would treat a foreign gift to the foundation as having made to either of the Clintons personally,\" Harrison said, who added that agencies have their own supplemental rules for this section, and he did not know if the State Department addressed this.\nOther experts on the libertarian side of the scale thought Gingrich was more right in his assertion.\nClinton violates the clause because of its intentionally broad phrasing about gifts of \"any kind whatever,\" which would cover indirect gifts via the foundation, said Dave Kopel, a constitutional law professor at Denver University and research director at the libertarian Independence Institute. Kopel also brought up bribery statutes, which would require that a gift had some influence in Clinton\u2019s decision while secretary of state.\nDelahunty thought Kopel\u2019s reasoning would have \"strange consequences,\" such as whether a state-owned airline flying Bill Clinton to a conference of former heads of state counted\u00a0as a gift to Hillary Clinton.\nOur ruling\nGingrich said the Clinton Foundation \"took money from from foreign governments while (Hillary Clinton) was secretary of state. It is clearly illegal. \u2026 The Constitution says you can\u2019t take this stuff.\"\nA clause in the Constitution does prohibit U.S. officials such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from receiving gifts, or emoluments, from foreign governments. But the gifts in this case were donations from foreign governments that went to the Clinton Foundation, not Hillary Clinton. She was not part of the foundation her husband founded while she was secretary of state.\nDoes that violate the Constitution?\nSome libertarian-minded constitutional law experts say it very well could. Others are skeptical. What\u2019s clear is there is room for ambiguity, and the donations are anything but \"clearly illegal.\" The reality is this a hazy part of U.S. constitutional\u00a0law.\u00a0\nGingrich\u2019s statement rate Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/947e9cfc-05c6-4bc4-a4f8-00ee07b8ee52", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06480"}
