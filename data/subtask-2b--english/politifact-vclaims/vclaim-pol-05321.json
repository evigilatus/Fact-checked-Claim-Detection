And there\u2019s no question that he\u2019s got a lot of money in his pockets and has been successful on that score. But if you look at his record overall \u2026 you say, \u2018OK, he made a lot of money for himself, he inherited a lot of money from his dad, but this is not a guy who is a self-made man, and this is a guy who\u2019s crushed a lot of people along the way.\u2019 \"\nThen, Todd asked Romney, \"Why\u2019d you say so many things about his business career, when clearly you\u2019re not impressed?\"\nRomney responded, \"You know, he\u2019s made a lot of money for himself, and I\u2019m gracious enough in a setting where someone has endorsed me to point out that he\u2019s been successful and made a lot of money -- he has a lot of hotels and so forth. But you can\u2019t also ignore the fact that he\u2019s had a lot of failures.\"\nWe took a look at Romney\u2019s remarks now and in 2012 to see whether he\u2019s flip-flopped on Trump\u2019s business record.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what Romney said during his March 3 speech when he criticized Trump:\n\"But wait, you say, isn\u2019t he a huge business success that knows what he\u2019s talking about? No, he isn\u2019t. His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them. He inherited his business, he didn\u2019t create it. And what ever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there\u2019s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage? A business genius he is not.\"\nAnd here\u2019s what Romney said in 2012 at a news conference in Las Vegas with Trump at his side:\n\"Being in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight. I'm so honored and pleased to have his endorsement. ... Donald Trump has shown an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works to create jobs for the American people. He's done it here in Nevada. He's done it across the country. ... I spent my life in the private sector. Not quite as successful as this guy. But successful nonetheless.\"\nRomney\u2019s comments in Las Vegas are less specific than what he said in 2016 -- he never singled out specific business ventures, other than the hotel where the endorsement event was being held.\nStill, in 2012, Romney communicated an overall admiration for Trump\u2019s business acumen, citing his \"extraordinary ability\" to understand how to create jobs \"across the country.\" Romney even said that his own -- and not insubstantial -- business accomplishments were \"not quite as successful\" as Trump\u2019s.\nWhen we contacted Romney\u2019s camp, they urged us to review the entirety of Romney\u2019s interviews after making his anti-Trump speech, including with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer, Fox Business News\u2019 Neil Cavuto, CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger, and Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Halperin.\nNot all of these interviews addressed Romney\u2019s views of Trump\u2019s business skills -- in the Fox Business and Bloomberg interviews, for instance, he emphasized as a reason for his change of heart some of the things Trump has done and said during the campaign, such as his comments about Muslims and Mexicans, his criticism of former President George W. Bush and his mixed signals on condemning the Ku Klux Klan.\nBut when Romney did address direct questions about his views on Trump\u2019s business record, his message seemed to be that he was focusing on the positive part of Trump\u2019s business history in 2012 and giving a more detailed, nuanced recounting in 2016.\n\"Oh, let me tell you, this is a guy if we look at the past, this is a guy who was very successful and made a lot of money for himself,\" Romney said in an interview on the March 6 Fox News Sunday. \"But at the same time, take a very close look and look how many small people he crushed along the way and how many failures he had.\"\nAnd in his interview with Lauer, Romney said, \"Oh, he's a successful guy -- he's made a lot of money -- but he hasn't been uniformly successful, and he's far from a business genius. Look, Trump University, Trump steaks, Trump mortgage, Trump vitamin company. One after the other, failure after failure. So just because he's made a lot of money, one, you don't measure your life by how much money you've made, but just because he's made a lot of money doesn't mean that his economic policies are right for America.\"\nStill, we see his comments four years apart as being fundamentally different in their message. Hearing Romney\u2019s 2012 comments, a listener would not have picked up on the notion he asserted in 2016 -- that \"a business genius (Trump) is not.\" We rate Romney\u2019s view on Trump\u2019s business record a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05321"}
