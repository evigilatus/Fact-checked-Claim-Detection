In a forum focused on national security, democracy was questioned by Hillary Clinton about her vote in the Senate in favour of action against Iraq. It also noted that Donald Trump initially supported the war. When Trump's turn came, the Republican candidate denied this charge. \"I was completely against the war in Iraq,\" Trump said during the NBC event. \"You can look at Esquire magazine from '04. You can look at it before that.\" Well, we're back beyond the 2004 interview that Trump mentioned, and the record tells a different story. Trump's having a hard time getting through an interview with Howard Stern in September 2002. Stern asked Trump if he supported the imminent invasion. Trump answered: \"Yeah, I think so.\" Trump called in another interview in January 2003, a few months before the invasion. Neil Cafoto of Fox News Trump asked whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. \"Well, he's either doing something or not doing something, maybe, because maybe he shouldn't have done it yet and maybe we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know,\" said Trump. \"He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a pretty good job. But, of course, if you look at polls, a lot of people get a little tired. I believe that the Iraqi situation is a problem. I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.\" So Trump put the economy before Iraq, but he didn't talk against going to war. He suggested, at the most, waiting for the United Nations to do something. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u25cf January 11, 2012, a week after the United States invasion of Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave a different response. At the Academy Awards after the party, Trump said that \"war is a mess,\" according to the Washington Post. Tell Fox News that because of the war, \"the market will rise like a rocket.\" \"Look at the war in Iraq and the chaos in which we are. I wouldn't have handled it that way. Trump has challenged many times in these elections to explain his early acceptance of the war. In an interview with NBC in February 2016 about the press meeting, Trump said that he did not know what he meant during his conversation with Stern in 2002. \"That was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head.\" Trump said. Our verdict, Trump, said it was \"oppositions to war in Iraq.\" When he came to this position when the war became difficult, he earlier accepted more military action. In 2002, he asked if America should go to war, and he said, \"I think so.\" Less than three months before the invasion, Trump said that the President should be more focused on the economy, but he did not speak against an attack. Trump didn't talk much about Iraq's war before it happened, but what he said did not add to the kind of opposition he described today. We value this allegation wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/836f664c-ac07-4562-9333-ddef770b3b65", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04362"}
