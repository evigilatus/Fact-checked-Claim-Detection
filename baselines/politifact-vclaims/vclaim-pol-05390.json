Further down on the page: \"In 2007, Joe Straus received a 100 percent rating by NARAL (the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League).\"\n\n\nImage from SpeakerStraus.com (fetched Feb. 12, 2016)\nWe wondered if the foundation\u2019s representation of NARAL\u2019s ratings were accurate.\nAs it turned out, the posted 2005 rating for Straus was inaccurate and the one for 2007 could arguably use a blinking asterisk.\nNARAL scorecards\nThe foundation didn't respond to repeated inquiries. But we found the NARAL Pro-Choice Texas scorecards using the web\u2019s Wayback Machine and confirmed their authenticity with a NARAL representative. In 2005, that year\u2019s scorecard shows, the group gave Straus a 45 percent rating \u2014 not \"100\" \u2014 for his House votes. Straus leaned \"pro-choice,\" the \u201805 scorecard says, in voting to require agencies getting funds for abstinence-only sex education to report to the state about successes reducing teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases and also voting on the group\u2019s side in four instances during action on abortion restrictions. But Straus otherwise took six \"anti-choice\" votes that session, the scorecard says, fueling his 5-of-11 rating.\nThe group\u2019s 2007 scorecard indeed shows a \"100%\" score for Straus based on his \"pro-choice\" vote against setting aside a NARAL-backed amendment to the 2008-09 state budget. But a web search led us to a Dec. 16, 2014, blog post by the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life\u2019s Joe Pojman stating Straus\u2019s 2007 rating \"has little validity. NARAL\u2019s scorecard is wrong.\" That is, Pojman wrote, Straus didn\u2019t even vote on the amendment that NARAL\u2019s scorecard cites for Straus\u2019 \"100.\"\nThe 2007 vote\nStop the carousel: Did Straus get his \u201807 \"100\" based on a single, possibly misreported vote?\nAccording to the \u201807 scorecard, Straus got his \"100\" for being 1-for-1 on the group\u2019s scored votes in which he participated \u2014 a result confirmed by email by Zoey Lichtenheld, communications coordinator for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas. Then again, the scorecard shows, Straus didn\u2019t vote on 10 other items potentially affecting each House member\u2019s NARAL rating; he wasn\u2019t on the House State Affairs Committee where the votes occurred.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLichtenfeld said NARAL records indicate Straus on March 29, 2007, voted on the group\u2019s side against tabling proposed Amendment 20 to the 2008-09 state budget, the committee substitute for House Bill 1. That amendment, offered by Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, sought to strip the state\u2019s Alternatives to Abortion program of its $5 million in funding over two years and put that amount into child abuse prevention grants for community organizations.\nAlternatives to Abortion program\nThe Alternatives to Abortion program\u2019s state backing traces to 2005 when a rider to the 2006-07 appropriations act directed $2.5 million a year in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funding to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program \"focused on pregnancy support services that promote childbirth\" among women who don\u2019t want abortions. \u00a0The program took the form of a network of clinics run by the nonprofit Texas Pregnancy Care Network that offer counseling along with adoption and parenting resources. In 2011, lawmakers amended a 2003 law and newly required doctors to give patients a directory listing such centers (along with a sonogram and verbal explanation of the sonogram) 24 hours before performing an abortion.\nNARAL has been an outspoken opponent of the Alternatives to Abortion program and of crisis pregnancy centers in general, deeming them \"outposts across the country with the sole purpose of preventing women from accessing abortion (through lies and coercion).\" In a March 2011 report, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas called the Alternatives to Abortion program \"bad health policy, bad fiscal policy,\" and described the program\u2019s primary provider, the Texas Pregnancy Care Network, as \"a wasteful and inefficient public structure\" that \"overestimated its budget needs by half a million dollars in FY 2010.\"\nHouse Journal: Straus absent from vote\nSo, what was Straus\u2019 position? We checked the Texas House Journal for voting details. It says Straus \u2014 who otherwise participated in 26 of 35 votes that day \u2014 was absent during the vote on Amendment 20, as were 11 of his colleagues.\nHouse-posted video of the floor action that day shows that after the amendment was offered, another legislator moved to table it. Next, Speaker Tom Craddick announced the unfavorable-to-NARAL result (89 ayes to 48 nays); the journal presents the same tally. From the video, we further determined that a few minutes after the vote, Straus wasn\u2019t at his desk on the floor; members usually vote from their desks.\nThe speaker\u2019s press secretary, Jason Embry, said by email he wasn\u2019t sure why Straus missed the decision.\nOur ruling\nThe foundation says Straus in 2005 and 2007 received 100 percent NARAL ratings.\nTo the contrary, Straus got a 45 percent \"pro-choice\" NARAL rating in 2005. And while he got that \"100\" in 2007, that result was based entirely on the group concluding that Straus sided with it on a budget amendment when, records show, he was absent from the scored vote.\nOn balance, we rate this claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05390"}
