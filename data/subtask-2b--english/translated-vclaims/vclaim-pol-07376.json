Bill O'Reily, Howard Kurtz and Megan Kelly are just some Fox hosts calling Sharpton for, they say, crossing moral lines and distorting MSNBC coverage of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Mo. Discussion: Charpton &apos; s dual role as host to the political nation of the Ministry of National Security, Political Affairs and Defence for the Brown family in the events following the fatal shooting by police officer Darren Wilson, including the memorial service at Brown &apos; s funeral on 25 August. Even worse for Fox News is the extent to which President Barack Obama's administration relies on Sharpton as a \"de facto contact and channel\" on ethnic issues, according to the summary of Pol\u00edtico's magazine. On the same night as Brown's funeral, Kelly Sharpton was criticized for pre-empting the facts in his fireflies to emotional crowds. It was the same part where O'Reily discussed the concept of \"white privilege,\" where Kelly provided numerous economic, social and educational statistics to show how black people in this country are disadvantaged. \"What they don't need in this case, or in any case, are people like the Sharptons who go in there and actually declare that Michael Brown didn't use any lethal force or pose a lethal threat to the officer,\" said Kelly. O'Reily said, \"Sure, it isolates everyone.\" \"If you have someone come and judge in advance -- someone you trust and depend on -- come and tell you the facts are one way, you believe him,\" said Kelly Sharpton. \"That's why he's abusing his power.\" We wanted to know if Sharpton said Brown \"didn't use any lethal force\" before he was killed. What happened to the official story of what happened before Brown was shot at at least six times is not well known -- the factor that drives unrest against law enforcement. The grand jury weighs the evidence in the case and will decide whether to charge Wilson, the St. Louis County Police and the FBI investigating the shooting. The CNN and Fox network have collected evidence for different accounts of witnesses and law enforcement about what happened. Before noon, there was a burglary claiming the strength of the arm including Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson at a store. Soon after, Wilson stopped the men for walking down the street, without knowing they were suspects in the robbery, said Chief Ferguson. Some witnesses and Brown's guns say Brown was shot and turned to face Wilson and raise his hands when Wilson shot him again, hitting his head. Wilson told the police that Brown assaulted him, pushed him into the patrol car, tried to grab his gun, and the town sheriff said that Wilson sought medical care for his swollen face after the fight. We will not go into more detail in this fact-finding exercise on various accounts, but we thought it was important to highlight how the accounts conflicted. We may never know what really happened, said David Klinger, Assistant Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri St. Louis. Klinger said: \"For anyone who has not seen the investigation file to say that he is absolutely certain that Mr. Brown could not have posed a threat to Officer Wilson's life, he is simply mistaken.\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 January 12, 2012, what Sharpton said about a week ago at Brown's funeral, Sharpton addressed Ferguson's residents at a unity rally. Sharpton says that Brown's grandfather invited him to the city. Sharpton denounced the release of security footage from the store as a post-mortem sweep of Brown's character, which did nothing to ignite what happened before he died. \"But the question is not whether it was stolen. It's not what he did before, \"Sherpton said Aug 17. \"The question is how a young man without a deadly threat, without life-long conditions, was shot several times. This is the issue, and this is the issue that America has to deal with.\" Kelly highlighted this part of his speech in August 19th edition of Kelly's file and hinted at it in the O'Reily Show on August 25. Charpton's defense: I'm not Walter Cronket. He defended himself in an interview with Bondet Fuckett. He does not deny that he basically said what Kelly described. However, he said that his audience knew his point of view and that he was giving his opinion that Brown was \"not a deadly threat\" because he was unarmed. No one's arguing that Brown didn't have a gun. He said, \"People don't think I'm Walter Cronkett spreading the news.\" \"This is my opinion, just as they give their views on white privilege.\" He changed his speech a little bit when he asked about Kelly's specific surprise, saying he thought there was no \"clear\" evidence that Brown was a deadly threat. Sharpton also said, if anything, that O'Reily and other Fox news hosts were equally guilty of expressing their views. \"If O'Reily can write books and all of them there can write books about their opinions, how can you tell me not to go to a gathering based on my opinion?\" He said Sharpton. \"We're all advocates. I use my foot to defend themselves, they use the pen to defend.\" It was not possible to reach Kelly through Fox or Twitter. In criticizing Sharpton, Kelly said, Sharpton went to Ferguson, Moe, which \"de facto declares that Michael Brown did not use any lethal force or posed any lethal threat to the officer.\" That's not exactly what Sharpton said, but it's very close. The only possible warning is Sharpton says he was speaking as a matter of opinion based on what he had so far, more than just a matter of fact. This is in the eye of the headmaster. Kelly's statement is accurate. We're assessing it right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07376"}
