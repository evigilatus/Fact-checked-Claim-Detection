The Congressional Budget Office said it could top $350 billion. But the payback was higher than expected, which former President Bill Clinton mentioned during an interview on The Daily Show. Describing the atmosphere at the height of the financial crisis, Clinton said, \"Everybody was all hands on deck and they did a lot of things, including the unpopular TARP bill to keep us from falling into a depression. By the way, you have gotten the TARP money back plus a profit.\"\n\nThis is something the former president has said before, so we decided to see if it is correct.\n\nIt isn\u2019t.\n\n\"The point about coming out ahead is wrong ,\" said Paul Kiel who has covered the bailout for the investigative news site ProPublica. \"But TARP won\u2019t be as much in the hole as people feared.\"\n\nClinton is right only if you look just at the money that went to banks. According to the latest update from the Treasury Department, $245 billion went out the door to banks and $266 billion came back. The $21 billion gain came from dividends and gains when Washington sold the shares it held.\n\nBut TARP went beyond banks. The government put $80 billion into General Motors, Chrysler and GM\u2019s financial subsidiary, GMAC. Another $68 billion went to the insurance company, American International Group, AIG. On a much smaller scale, $5 billion has been used to help homeowners avoid defaulting on their mortgages and other housing market assistance.\n\nThis is where Clinton\u2019s statement goes off track. The government still has plenty of money tied up in GM, GMAC and AIG. Between the three, taxpayers are looking at about $57 billion outstanding.\n\nOnce you account for the profit made on the banking side, TARP is $34 billion in the hole.\n\nThat is a fraction, about 10 percent, of the original estimate. Where TARP ends up is of course a matter of educated guesswork, but most analysts expect the loss to decline further. In March, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the total lifetime cost would be $32 billion. Kiel thinks it could drop below $20 billion. Kiel is bullish on AIG.\n\n\"It\u2019s extremely likely that all the AIG money will come back,\" Kiel said, \"and it could even be positive.\"\n\nIn 2010, Congress capped the program at $475 billion. Looking ahead, the greatest uncertainty lies with the housing foreclosure program within TARP. The government has barely dipped into the $45 billion available and there\u2019s over a year left for people to apply. Whatever is spent will not be repaid.\n\nOur ruling\n\nFormer President Clinton said government got the TARP money back plus interest.\n\nThat is correct for the money that went to banks. It is incorrect for TARP as a whole. The program remains about $34 billion in the red.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
