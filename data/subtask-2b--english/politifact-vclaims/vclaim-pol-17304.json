Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took to Twitter\u00a0Tuesday to challenge the latest coronavirus guidance as vaccines were being distributed around the country.\nCruz responded specifically to Dr. Vin Gupta, a lung and intensive care unit doctor who appeared on MSNBC to caution vaccine recipients against abandoning the kinds of preventative measures public health experts have been emphasizing all year.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This is one of the misperceptions here: just because you get vaccinated with a second dose, it does not mean you should be participating in things like traveling in the middle of an out-of-control pandemic or that you\u2019re liberated from masks,\" Gupta told MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd. \"Everything still applies until all of us get the two-dose regimen, and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen until June or July.\"\u00a0\nMany unknowns surround the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. For instance, it\u2019s unclear if vaccinations strictly protect infected people from serious illness, or if they also prevent people from getting infected, Gupta said.\n\"Don\u2019t let your guard down just because you got vaccinated,\" he said. \"You might be able to get infected by the virus and pass it on to others.\"\nThe comment was enough to peeve Cruz, who has previously criticized guidance to wear masks and other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\"This is a bizarre, lunatic, totalitarian cult,\" Cruz said in a tweet responsive to Gupta\u2019s mask-wearing advice. \"It\u2019s not about vaccines or protecting people\u2019s lives \u2014 it is instead profoundly anti-science, and is only focused on absolute govt control of every aspect of our lives.\"\nIn July, Cruz faced criticism after he was photographed maskless on an American Airlines flight one month after the airline required passengers to wear face masks while onboard planes.\nCruz stirred controversy again when he called Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, \"a complete ass\" for asking a fellow senator to wear a mask while speaking. And in November, as Texas public health officials urged people to avoid large holiday gatherings as daily case numbers reached record highs, Cruz tweeted a graphic with the words \"Come and take it\" beneath a Thanksgiving turkey.\nSo is the latest round of COVID-19 guidance \u2014 urging\u00a0continued mask-wearing and discouraging travel \u2014 \"profoundly anti-science\" as Cruz claims?\n\"I think [Cruz] is talking beyond his knowledge,\" said Dr. Jaquelin Dudley, professor of molecular biosciences and associate director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas.\n\"This whole thing about mask-wearing, taking a vaccine and social distancing has somehow become a political football instead of, let's just talk about what we know and what we don't know,\" she said.\nScience-based guidance\nCruz\u2019s office did not respond to a request\u00a0for clarification on precisely what the senator meant by \"anti-science.\" And a spokesperson for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the organization for which Gupta works, declined to address Cruz\u2019s comments in an effort to remain apolitical. (\"With the issue at hand \u2014 responding to comments by a U.S. senator stating that protective measures against COVID-19 constitute \"bizarre, lunatic, totalitarian cult\" \u2014 it would be impossible to make this apolitical,\" a spokesperson said.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the guidance highlighted by Gupta is the same messaging that has come from the very top level of the U.S. coronavirus response apparatus. On Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Donald Trump\u2019s top adviser on the coronavirus crisis, spoke before an online audience and gave the same cautionary advice.\n\"It\u2019s not going to be like turning a light switch on and off. It\u2019s not going to be overnight. It\u2019s going to be gradual. ... I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to be able to throw the masks away and forget about physical separation and congregant settings for a while, probably likely until we get into the late fall and early next winter, but I think we can do it,\" he said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also advises that there is not enough information \"to say if or when CDC will stop recommending that people wear masks and avoid close contact with others,\" suggesting that more time is needed for experts to understand how the virus will respond to vaccinated persons.\nAccording to Dr. Jonathan Temte of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, the clinical trials of the vaccine have only looked at how the vaccine prevents illness. Those trials didn\u2019t provide any information on transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could still carry and spread the virus.\nIt takes repeat exposures for the immune system to learn how to best fight off a virus, which is why COVID-19 vaccinations require two doses about three weeks apart, according to the CDC. Clinical trials through the National Institutes of Health tell us that the immune system begins to create a beta version of antibodies after a person receives the first dose of the vaccine. These are the body\u2019s least optimal version of these antibodies. Phase III trials \u2014 which test for vaccine\u00a0efficacy \u2014 indicate these initial antibodies are capable of fighting off severe illness caused by the virus, but may be less capable of preventing the virus\u2019\u00a0spread.\u00a0\nA second dose of the vaccine helps the body create a new version of antibodies more honed in on fighting COVID-19. A person\u2019s immune system is most capable of fighting off COVID-19 about one month after the initial dose of vaccine.\u00a0\n\"Your body learns. You can\u2019t assume that on day one after the vaccine you\u2019re going to be protected and you\u2019re not going to be able to spread the infection,\" Dudley said.\n\"We don\u2019t have that data yet. There\u2019s been so many things to learn,\" she said.\nThis is one of the primary sources of uncertainty surrounding the vaccine: whether vaccinated people can be contagious.\u00a0If vaccinations protect only against illness and not transmissions, achieving herd immunity through vaccination becomes more difficult, according to the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet.\n\"Pfizer and Moderna together project that there will be enough vaccines for 35 million individuals in 2020, and perhaps up to 1 billion in 2021,\" The Lancet wrote. \"As a result, many millions of people at high risk of disease will not be immunized any time soon, necessitating the continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions.\"\nFurthermore, it\u2019s also unknown how long immunity will last in a vaccinated person, or how effective vaccination will be in older people or those with underlying comorbidities.\nOur ruling\nThe guidance issued by the CDC that urges vaccinated people to continue wearing masks and avoid travel was described by Cruz as \"profoundly anti-science.\"\nThe emerging vaccines each were placed through months of clinical trials that tested for their efficacy in preventing illness. Their efficacy in preventing transmission was not part of the trials and is not yet known. The guidance issued by the public health community is borne out of science\u2019s blind spots in regard\u00a0to transmission and the gradual pace of vaccine distribution.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17304"}
