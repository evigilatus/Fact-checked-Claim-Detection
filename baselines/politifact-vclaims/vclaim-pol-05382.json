Todd Richardson mostly accurate in assessment of earning power for Missouri families", "text": "Ranked 47th in the nation by Business Insider, Missouri\u2019s seemingly stagnant economy has been a talking point for politicians across the state in recent months.\nSpeaker of the House Todd Richardson recently weighed in on the discussion, specifically addressing the income and earning power of Missourians.\nOn \"This Week in Missouri Politics,\" Richardson said, \"Missouri families earn $5,000 less, their earning power is about 5,000 less today, than it was at the turn of the century.\"\u00a0\nHas the typical Missouri household lost that much ground since 2000?\nShifts in median household income\nWe were directed by Richardson\u2019s office to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s statistics on median household income. When adjusted for inflation, the median Missouri family brought home $56,360 in 2014, down more than $5,000 from the median family income of $61,995 in 2000.\nThose numbers support Richardson\u2019s statement. But the median income number jumps around a fair bit from year to year. If Richardson had chosen just slightly different starting and end points, the result could create a different impression.\nFor example, in 1998, the median household income in Missouri was $58,355. And in 2013, Missouri\u2019s median household income was $47,601 \u2013 significantly lower than the statistic for 2014.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Saku Aura, associate professor of Public Economics at the University of Missouri, said even with those ups and downs, the overall trend is not debatable. \"Missouri\u2019s economy has undoubtedly had very little to no positive growth in the last 15 years or so,\" Aura said.\nAura gave us a couple of reasons for the swings in median income. The Census Bureau sample is small and the margin of error can be over $3,000. And he also noted that family size has been edging down. \n\"If there are less people in each family, it would make sense that perhaps there is less money being earned.\"\nAnother way to measure income is to look at the average per person. By that yardstick, personal income has increased over the past 15 years. But big gains by a relative few earners at the high end pull up the average in ways that don\u2019t reflect the typical person\u2019s experience.\n\n\"It\u2019s a trend we\u2019ve seen across the country almost since the \u201870s,\" Aura said. \"Most economic growth comes for the highest quartile, not the middle class or poorer families.\" \u00a0\nOur ruling\nRichardson largely got his numbers right when he said that Missouri\u2019s families\u2019 \"earning power is less today than it was at the start of the century.\" \u00a0While his exact numbers could be off, the general trend holds up. The typical household is making less.\nWe rate Richardson\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05382"}
