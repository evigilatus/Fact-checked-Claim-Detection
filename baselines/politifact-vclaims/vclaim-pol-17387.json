Strong feelings over the tragedy have targeted Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.\nOne Facebook post highly and misleadingly edited Warren\u2019s comments about the Tibbetts murder.\nThe post includes two pictures of Tibbetts and has this text:\n\"So Elizabeth Warren was asked about Mollie Tibbetts being murdered by an illegal immigrant\u2026.. Her reply was: \u2018I know this is hard for her family, but they have to remember that we need to focus on real problems like illegal immigrants not being able to see their kids\u2019 Let that sink in.\"\nAnyone reading that could easily see Warren as dismissive of a murder. But that post chopped up her actual response and changed her meaning.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIn a Aug. 22, 2018, interview, CNN anchor John Berman asked Warren this question: \"Mike Pence and the president have suggested the immigration laws need to be stronger so that people like this man who was accused of this murder were not in the country.

(The bolded words are the ones used in the Facebook post.)\n\"I'm so sorry for the family and I know this is hard, not only for the family, but for the people in her community, the people throughout Iowa.\n\"But one of the things we have to remember is we need an immigration system that is effective, that focuses on where real problems are.\n\"Last month, I went down to the border and I saw where children had been taken away from their mothers, I met with those mothers who had been lied to, who didn't know where their children were, who hadn't had a chance to talk to their children, and there was no plan for how they would be reunified with their children.\n\"I think we need immigration laws that focus on people who pose a real threat and I don't think mamas and babies are the place we should be spending our resources. Separating a mama from a baby does not make this country safer.\"\nOut of the 157 words Warren said, the post used 16 (17 if you count its shift of \"focuses\" to \"focus\"). It added words she didn\u2019t say, such as \"illegal immigrants not being able to see their kids.\" It added small words, such as \"they\" to have her purported quote make grammatical sense and match the meaning the people behind the post wanted to create.\nThe Facebook version omits Warren\u2019s words about focusing \"on people who pose a real threat.\" Warren contrasted enforcement that targets those who have or might commit violence, and enforcement that separates small children from their parents \u2014 the \"zero tolerance\" policy under the Trump administration in 2018.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17387"}
