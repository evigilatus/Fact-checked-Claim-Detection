Where the suckers believe themselves to be successful behind the wheel of their fathers\u2019 cars, and a father who has a little bit of power is trying to prove to you that you\u2019re a nobody.\"\nAnd on and on; In other words, be excellent to each other. You can read it all for yourself, but we first saw the quote in an April 26, 2017, post on BestThings.us. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to combat fabricated news.\nThe same quote has appeared on several other websites, going back to 2016, always attributed to Reeves. It even appeared on an English-language Pakistani newspaper\u2019s website.\nWe also found the quote attributed to him in a Russian-language video that appears to show him saying it (we used the translated captions) \u2014 but it actually shows him talking about a Paul Gauguin exhibit in Switzerland. Another video example used a computerized voice to recite the quote.\nIt\u2019s also appeared on Facebook. And we mean, it\u2019s appeared all over Facebook, again credited to Reeves.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while that seems like a deep message from the guy who played John Wick, we can\u2019t find any record of Reeves saying it.\nAs best we can tell, the quote\u2019s association with Reeves came from a Facebook fan page called \"Keanu Reeves - the actor.\" The page posted the quote, wherever they got it from, on Feb. 21, 2016. The page\u2019s About section said Reeves was allowed to post on the page or moderate as he saw fit. There was no contact information.\nBut Reeves\u2019 publicist, Cheryl Maisel of talent agency PMK-BNC, said the actor had no affiliation with the page.\n\"Keanu does not participate in any form of social media,\" she said via email. \"This Facebook page is fake.\"\nMaisel told us she had the entire fan page removed from Facebook.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time a famous person was misquoted on the Internet, of course. And Reeves knows a little something about being on the Internet.\nBut he wasn\u2019t The One who made this protracted speech.
