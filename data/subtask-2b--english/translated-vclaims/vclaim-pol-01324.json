The West Virginia Republican Party says he did it.

But we wanted to confirm this with the original data. The source of the comparison between 50 States was found to be a report prepared by the general contractors associated with America, a commercial association in the construction industry. The comparison was drawn from data collected by the Federal Office for Labour Statistics. These are the five states with the largest percentage increase during 2017. The State's increase in jobs increases by 12 months in West Virginia by 14.4,300 per cent in California by 75,500.9 per cent, verifying the facts mentioned by Rachel on January 16, 2021 in the tweeting of a thousand minimum wages of $15 per hour, raising the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 20 January 2021 Nevada 7,800 9.7% New Mexico 4,300 9.7% Idaho 3,800 8.7% so the party's tweet was accurate. We also took a long-term look at the construction functions in the state. According to the Labour Statistics Office, employment in the construction sector in West Virginia was interrupted in the second half of 2016 and rose continuously until the first quarter of 2018 before settling down. However, the current level of construction employment in West Virginia did not return to the peak of nearly three decades in the period leading up to the beginning of the Great Depression. It should be noted that construction jobs, while important for persons employed in industry and neighbouring industries, account for only about 4.5 per cent of non-agricultural employment in the State - some 34,000 construction jobs in August 2018 out of a total of 752,000 non-agricultural jobs. \"Total job growth is clearly of interest to the citizens of West Virginia more than employment in a single industry that is not very large,\" said Gary Portless, economist with the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. However, with regard to limited tweeting allegations, they are accurate. The ruling West Virginia Republican Party wrote on Twitter that \"West Virginia added the highest proportion of new construction jobs in 2017 in the United States, by 14.4%? The number of additional posts was 4,300. In fact, #WV was the only case with double-digit growth!\" A look at the original data shows that number. One order, the increase in percentage, and the initial increase in all posts are correct. The same is true of the discrimination of West Virginia as the only country to have achieved two-digit growth in 2017. We're evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01324"}
