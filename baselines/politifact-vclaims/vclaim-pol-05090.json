They\u2019ve \"retired,\" collected a lump sum of cash by cashing in their Deferred Retirement Option Program payment and then come back to work for the city days, months or years later. In 2011, the controversy\u00a0surrounding DROP\u00a0led to six council members resigning or losing their seat. Jim Kenney was not one of them. He didn\u2019t use DROP and was outspoken against it as a councilman, calling for the program\u00a0to be eliminated.\nNow it appears Kenney is cool with DROP \u2014 for the right employees.\nThe\u00a0Inquirer\u00a0revealed\u00a0last week Kenney\u2019s chief tech officer, Charles Brennan, took a DROP payment of $337,695 in 2006 when he retired from the police department. He now makes $165,000 a year in his current position. Mitchell J. Yanak retired from the police department in 2003, took a $99,537 DROP payment and now makes $142,800.\nJim Kenney\u2019s director of communications, Lauren Hitt, told the newspaper \"It was decided that their decision to take DROP was not a disqualification because they both retired from the city many years ago and clearly did not intend to abuse DROP. While Mayor Kenney personally doesn\u2019t support DROP, he can\u2019t fault highly qualified city employees for appropriately utilizing a benefit that\u2019s available to them.\"\nThe statement stands in stark contrast with what Hitt said in January while expressing Kenney\u2019s thoughts about City Commissioner Anthony Clark. Clark, who\u2019s been accused of rarely going to work and didn\u2019t vote in several elections despite being in charge of them, filed for DROP. He\u2019ll be able to receive $495,000 when his current four-year term ends. The\u00a0Inquirer\u00a0wrote\u00a0of the Kenney administration\u2019s reactions like this:\n\"Word of his signing on for DROP drew a swift rebuke from the new mayor. \u2018It\u2019s a slap in the face to all Philadelphians,\u2019 Mayor Kenney said Thursday night through spokeswoman Lauren Hitt, \u2018especially all our city workers who show up and do their jobs well every day.\u2019\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHitt confirmed to\u00a0Billy Penn\u00a0the above quote was intended to be about Clark\u2019s decision to apply for DROP. But she doesn\u2019t see this as a change in stance.\n\"Brennan and Yanak retired from the PPD 10 and 13 years ago, respectively, where they did excellent work,\" Hitt said. \"Clark is regularly absent from work and despite being in charge of the City\u2019s elections, didn\u2019t even vote \u2013 I\u2019m not sure you could find many Philadelphians who would classify him as a \"highly-qualified city employee.\"\nWe followed up by asking whether Kenney is of the opinion it\u2019s OK for people to take DROP if they are good employees and don\u2019t work for the city for a while? She responded, \"What Clark did is a slap in the face because he added insult to injury. He doesn\u2019t show up to vote, he doesn\u2019t show up to work and now he\u2019s going to collect the DROP. If you don\u2019t show up to work, you shouldn\u2019t get a salary let alone a retirement package.\n\"As a result, there\u2019s no contradiction with what I send this week regarding Brennan and Yanak. Clark isn\u2019t a \u2018high-quality employee,\u2019 he\u2019s an elected official with an abysmal attendance record, and he\u2019s not \u2018appropriately utilizing\u2019 DROP.\"\nBut Kenney\u2019s position on DROP for Brennan and Yanak doesn\u2019t square with his past statements, either during his time on Council and or on the campaign trail. He\u00a0reminded\u00a0people last year while he was running for mayor he voted against DROP. In a fundraising email, Kenney\u00a0criticized\u00a0mayoral candidate Lynne Abraham for taking DROP and speaking against legislation he had sponsored that led to larger payments for retirees when the city\u2019s pension fund outperforms its goals.\nEarlier this month,\u00a0it was also reported\u00a0Kenney decided against hiring John T. McGrath as fire chief because he had taken a partial DROP payment. Hitt said no prospective candidate for that position was disqualified due to their history with DROP.\nWe rate Kenney\u2019s statement of support for Brennan and Yanak on taking DROP payments a full flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05090"}
