On March 22, a City Council committee took testimony on the practice--and at least one speaker referred to the chemical additive as an industrial toxic waste, according to video of the hearing placed online.\n\nFord answered our request for backup by forwarding information from various sources including a November 2009 memo from an assistant city manager to Austin\u2019s City Council stating that after voter approval, the Austin Water Utility began adding fluoride to the water supply Feb. 2, 1973; the council can change the practice by majority vote.\n\nNationally in 2008, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 195.5 million people (72.4 percent) on public water systems had access to \"optimally fluoridated\" water, up from 69 percent of individuals on public water supplies in 2006.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency regulates how much fluoride that drinking water should have. The current recommended range is 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams (parts per million) per liter of water, though the EPA and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans in January to consider setting the limit at the low end of the current standard, 0.7 milligrams.\n\nPeter Silva, an EPA water administrator, said: \"EPA\u2019s new analysis will help us make sure that people benefit from tooth decay prevention while at the same time avoiding the unwanted health effects from too much fluoride.\"\n\nOne health effect is dental fluorosis, which the agency\u2019s announcement says \"may occur with excess fluoride consumption during the tooth-forming years, age 8 and younger. Dental fluorosis in the United States appears mostly in the very mild or mild form \u2013 as barely visible lacy white markings or spots on the enamel. The severe form of dental fluorosis, with staining and pitting of the tooth surface, is rare in the United States.\" (It\u2019s not rare in the Texas Panhandle, where groundwater is naturally high in fluoride.)\n\nThe city of Austin memo says the \"level of fluoride naturally occurring in the raw water supply for the City of Austin is 0.20 to 0.24 mg/l or parts per million. The Austin Water Utility adjusts the fluoride level to a range of 0.6 \u2013 0.9 mg/l, averaging at about 0.75 mg/l. These values are well within the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines for optimally fluoridated water as well as being within the recommended range from (the World Health Organization).\"\n\nAnd what of the chemical compound cited in Ford\u2019s letter? The memo says the fluoride product used is hydrofluorosilicic acid, which fulfills a standard ensuring \"purity of products for the control of potential adverse human-health effects from products added directly to the water during treatment, storage and distribution.\" There\u2019s no mention of fertilizer in the 17-page memo.\n\nNext, spokeswoman Jill Mayfield of the water utility sent us a statement stating that the acid, also known as FSA, is supplied by Mosaic Chemicals, which she said has bought Lucier Chemical. Mosaic generally describes itself as the world\u2019s leading producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash, two primary fertilizers.\n\nMayfield said hydrofluorosilic acid is \"derived from apatite which is a type of limestone deposit used in the production of fertilizers. The apatite is ground up and treated with sulfuric acid producing phosphoric acid (the main ingredient in the production of phosphate fertilizer) plus a solid and two gases. The two gases, hydrogen fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride, are captured in water to form hydrofluorosilicic acid.\"\n\nAn entry on Mosaic\u2019s site aligns with Mayfield\u2019s explanation. It says the vapor stream from the phosphoric acid reaction is scrubbed with water to form FSA from the naturally occurring silica and fluorine in the phosphoric acid.\"\n\nWe ran Ford\u2019s description of the acid as \"toxic waste\" past the company. Spokesman Rob Litt replied by e-mail: \"Many fluoridation opponents will cite the toxicity of the chemical in its concentrated form. This is a fallacy as no one is ingesting this concentrated form. By this rationale, these same individuals should also be opposed to Vitamin D, B6, A & E, which are all considered toxic in concentrated form.\"\n\nFor more perspective, we contacted the CDC where Linda Orgain, a spokeswoman in its Division of Oral Health, said by e-mail that fluorosilicic acid \"is not toxic waste.\" She pointed us to a CDC web page on water fluoridation with a section stating: \"All additives used at water treatment plants, including fluoride additives, must meet strict quality standards that assure the public\u2019s safety. These additives are subject to a stringent system of standards, testing, and certificates by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the National Sanitation Foundation/American National Standards Institute (NSF/ANSI). Both of these entities are nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations.\"\n\nOrgain added: \"There are no health implications for community water fluoridation \u2013 at the level used for community water fluoridation (currently 0.7-1.2 mg/L) fluoridation prevents and controls tooth decay \u2013 preventing about 25 percent of decay in children and adults, throughout the lifespan.\"\n\nWe filled Ford in on our research. He replied that the acid purchased by water providers cannot otherwise be dumped in the ocean, inland waterways or landfills unless it\u2019s contained: \"It\u2019s toxic until they sell it to the city and then magically the city puts it in our water.\"\n\nNext, the CDC\u2019s national water fluoridation engineer, Kip Duchon, said it\u2019s ridiculous to call the water additive toxic waste. Duchon said the compound put in water comes from gypsum, a byproduct of phosphate-based fertilizer plants that often ends up piled in landfills. The compound results from a gas that\u2019s isolated via vacuum extraction, he said, then quenched with water, making the acid.\n\nPer Ford\u2019s point about pouring the acid into bodies of water, Duchon replied: \"It\u2019s no different than any other acid (undiluted) that would kill everything in the lake. It would be irresponsible of anyone to capriciously or arbitrarily dump . any chemical in a water body.\"\n\nDuchon said the acid becomes toxic at concentrations of more than 100 milligrams per liter, over 100 times the concentration in Austin\u2019s water. He said he was aware of one episode involving such a toxic error involving a small community\u2019s water well; an Alaska man died.\n\nFord urged us to seek more on the compound\u2019s toxicity from Neal Carman, also a participant in Fluoride Free Austin. Carman said a loophole in federal environmental law makes it possible to sell the compound so long as it\u2019s going to be diluted. Then, he said, it\u2019s no longer considered a hazardous waste.\n\nWe were unable to confirm or disprove this claim; Mosaic\u2019s description of the acid it ships to Austin says it\u2019s corrosive but stable when stored properly.\n\nAt the EPA, spokesman Richard Yost said by email that in \"water at levels used for fluoridation, hexafluorosilicic acid hydrolyzes essentially completely to fluoride ions and various forms of silica... Various forms of silica and silicates occur in nature as sand and do not represent any health hazard.\"\n\nYost said the fluoride compound put into Austin\u2019s water is not on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act list of \"hazardous constituents\" nor is it on the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s hazardous materials transport list.\n\nFinally, we asked city officials to speak to Ford\u2019s \"toxic waste\" reference.\n\nPhilip Huang, medical director for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department, said it\u2019s misleading and inflammatory to call the acid, which he calls a byproduct, toxic waste. Staff toxicologist Janet Pichette said the key issue for any substance is concentration. Even too much water \"could kill you,\" she said.\n\nLast gulp: Ford\u2019s statement accurately notes that the water utility buys the acid that fluoridates Austin\u2019s drinking water from a fertilizer maker. Yet there\u2019s no reasonable support for calling the the same acid toxic waste; it\u2019s not poisonous at its concentration in the water. We rate the statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13232"}
