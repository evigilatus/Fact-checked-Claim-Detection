Scott Walker: \"The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate equal to twice the rate at which we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under the government. (Walker) When asked to support this claim, the Burke campaign referred us to data from the quarterly employment surveys conducted by the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics. These data are considered to be the most reliable measure of jobs, although their timing is less than that of independent monthly employment surveys. The campaign told us that statistics show that the United States is growing at a rate of almost double that of Wisconsin. Burke, however, was more decisive at the rally, saying \"two times the rate.\" The Burke formulation of the point of dialogue has changed. In early 2014, she said that the most recent data from the quarterly surveys showed that the national rate was \"almost double\" that of Wisconsin. At that stage, I quoted a story from the newspaper Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that reached the same conclusion after Wisconsin reported growth of 1.9 per cent as compared to 1.9 per cent at the national level from June 2012 to June 2013. At that time, this was the latest available data, owing to the late issuance of the detailed quarterly figures, we crushed the same figures as the Burke campaign, and we examined private sector employment, which was the focus of candidate plans. The figures show that from the beginning of Walker's term until the end of his third year, national profit was 6.6 per cent compared to 4.1 per cent in Wisconsin. This means that growth in the United States was 1.6 times that in Wisconsin. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women have a job. On January 15, 2021, Wisconsin grew at 1.3% in the last year (March 2013 to March 2014), compared to 2.1% in the United States. The same result: The national rate was 1.6 times better. While we have been studying year-long growth in different quarterly perspectives, we have repeatedly witnessed growth greater than 1.6 to 1.7 times in relation to national figures. (We also looked at the results of another survey of government jobs, namely monthly reports.) It is more modern - up to September 2014 - but less reliable. They also show a national growth of 1.6 times in the state, since the beginning of Walker's reign.) There were some smaller and larger differences at different points along the way. Annual growth rates in the United States in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and in early 2014 ranged from 1.2 to 2 times those in Wisconsin. The high point was from September 2011 to September 2012, when the rate was twice that of Wisconsin. Our assessment, Burke, claimed that \"the nation as a whole created jobs at a rate equal to twice the rate at which we created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gove. (Walker) Wisconsin lags far behind the country, but often not as bad as Burke says, based on last year and the results of most of Walker's term. We value the claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07052"}
