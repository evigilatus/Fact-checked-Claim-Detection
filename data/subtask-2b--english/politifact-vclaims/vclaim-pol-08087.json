Marco Rubio, R-Fla., spoke out against the law in a video message to his supporters.\n\"We cannot give up,\" he said. \"Obamacare is not something that\u2019s set in stone. It can be repealed \u2014and Americans increasingly want it to be repealed \u2014 and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do.\"\nPolitiFact wanted to know if Rubio\u2019s assessment of polling on the law is accurate. Do more and more people want the law repealed? We didn\u2019t hear back from Rubio\u2019s folks.\nMany major pollsters include a question about repeal in their periodic surveys. Reports from the nonpartisan\u00a0RealClearPolitics and the conservative\u00a0American Enterprise Institute, both institutions that cover politics, don\u2019t match up with Rubio\u2019s claim. These averages across polling platforms are useful, but they also draw from a small number of polls and combine results from a question each group asked in a slightly different way.\nRealClearPolitics shows that in December 2013, about 52.3 percent of the public favored repealing the law. Since 2011, that number hasn\u2019t wavered much.\nRealClearPolitics arrived at these figures by averaging reports from Quinnipiac, Rasmussen, Fox and CNN surveys.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Senior fellow Karlyn Bowman said she\u2019d peg the repeal rate at anywhere between 35 to 45 percent, depending on the poll.\nAlthough the numbers vary based on question wording and possible responses, the trends themselves don\u2019t, experts said. The percentage of the country that wants to repeal Obamacare is sizable, but not growing.\n\"If you look poll to poll, it\u2019s not clear that they\u2019re rising dramatically, but it\u2019s still a big number and something people should pay attention to,\" Bowman said. \"Repeal sounds radical, and we\u2019re just not a very radical kind of people. We like to take the middle ground if possible.\"\nOur ruling\nRubio said, \"Americans increasingly want (Obamacare) to be repealed.\" Depending on which polls you consult, anywhere from about 35 to 50 percent of the nation does want the law repealed. That\u2019s not insignificant.\nBut we take issue with his claim that as time goes on, more voters are calling for repeal. Experts say the percentage of voters who want Obamacare repealed is staying consistent within each poll.\nWe rate Rubio\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08087"}
