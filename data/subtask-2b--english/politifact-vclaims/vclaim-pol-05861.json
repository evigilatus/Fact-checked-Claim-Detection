My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, \u2018this will help raise your wages.\u2019 And I concluded I could not.\"\nClinton\u2019s phrasing -- that she said she \"hoped it would be the gold standard\" -- implies that she was undecided on the TPP. But that doesn\u2019t exactly match up to her prior comments. We found that her previous remarks actually gave the impression that she had confidence in the deal as it stood.\nIn Australia in 2012, Clinton delivered remarks on the general topic of the U.S.-Australia relationship. Here\u2019s everything she said about the TPP in that address, with the \"gold standard\" comment in bold.\n\"So it's fair to say that our economies are entwined, and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner. This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\"\nSo it seems Clinton is saying the TPP does, definitevely set the gold standard -- as opposed to Clinton hoping it will.\nIn other addresses around the same time, she expressed similar assuredness that the TPP would meet a high standard. In November 2012 remarks in Singapore, she encouraged all nations \"willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP\" to join the deal.\n\"The so-called TPP will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment. Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia's middle class and rebalance the global economy. Canada and Mexico have already joined the original TPP partners. We continue to consult with Japan. And we are offering to assist with capacity building, so that every country in ASEAN can eventually join. We welcome the interest of any nation willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP, including China.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of the other words Clinton used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: \"exciting,\" \"innovative,\" \"ambitious,\" \"groundbreaking,\" \"cutting-edge,\" \"high-quality\" and \"high-standard.\" (To read more of her comments in full, check out our previous article on this subject.)\nAs a presidential candidate Clinton has used more hedging language, for example saying she has \"some concerns,\" and now she has said she outright doesn\u2019t support the deal as it stands.\nIn her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, she wrote:\n\"Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It\u2019s safe to say the TPP won\u2019t be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers.\"\nIn fairness to Clinton, the TPP was still under negotiation when Clinton made the \"gold standard\" comment. The partners only finalized the deal this year. It\u2019s quite possible the deal looks dramatically different than it did at the early stages of negotiations, when Clinton was at the State Department -- something Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out to us for this fact-check. The negotiations have been conducted in secret, so it\u2019s hard for us to assess that ourselves. Also, as secretary of state, she spoke as a representative of the Obama administration, which was and remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal.\nOur ruling\nClinton said when she was secretary of state, she was reserving judgment but \"hoped (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) would be the gold standard.\"\nShe\u2019s twisting her 2012 remarks a bit. Clinton said, \"This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements,\" which is a more confident claim than if she had said she \"hoped\" it would meet that standard. This is in contrast to more recent comments where Clinton said she had concerns about the deal and that she ultimately opposes it.\nThe statement is distorting her previous comments.
