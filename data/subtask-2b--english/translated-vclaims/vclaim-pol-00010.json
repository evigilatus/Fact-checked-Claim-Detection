He didn't do it.", "text": "After President Donald Trump declared that terrorist leader Abubakar al-Baghdadi had died, Trump repeated his inaccurate pride in calling for the elimination of Osama bin Laden before the attacks of 11 September. Trump said he warned in his book in January 2000, \"The America We Worth.\" Trump spoke to reporters in October 27, and said that he had no appreciation for warning him that Bin Laden should have been killed. \"You know, if you read my book -- there was a book right before the World Trade Center went down. And I don't get any credit for this, but that's okay. I never do that. But here we are. I've written a book that's really very successful. In that book, about a year before the World Trade Center bombing, I said, \"There's a guy named Osama bin Laden. You'd better kill him or kill him. Trump continued by saying that he told people \"Kill Osama bin Laden,\" although \"no one heard about Osama bin Laden until the World Trade Center. \"But about a year - you have to make it happen - a year and a year and a half before the World Trade Center comes down, the book came out. I was talking about Osama bin Laden. And I said to him, \"You have to kill him. \"You have to get rid of him, no one has listened to me.\" A similar statement was made by Tramp in a speech as a presidential candidate in Virginia in 2015. We've assessed this statement as mostly wrong. In other speeches in 2015, Trump went further and said that he \"expected\" bin Laden and terrorism. Trump wrote a criticism of bin Laden in his book, but he did not suggest that it be taken out. What Trump has already written about bin Laden is mentioned once in the book, specifically in a paragraph critical of President Bill Clinton's approach to national security: \"Trap refers to the insurgency law - General Flynn will be appointed as Vice-President\" wrote in January 10, 2021. By Samantha Butterman \u2022 January 11, 2012: instead of a looming crisis hanging over us, we face an amazing series of small crises, hot spots, standing away, hot spots. We don't play chess to end all chess games anymore. We're playing a game of chess - one master against many competitors. One day we confirmed that Iraq was under control. The United Nations inspectors did their job. Everything was fine. The next day the explosion begins. One day, we were told that a mysterious person named Osama bin Laden was the general enemy number one, and that U.S. jet fighters threw garbage at his camp in Afghanistan. He escaped again under some rocks, and after a few news sessions, he was on a new enemy and a new crisis.\" (Emphasis of the Green Line is ours.) The Trump reference to bin Laden relates to the bombing by the United States of its camps in Afghanistan and the Sudan on August 20, 1998. Clinton said that they were in retaliation for terrorist bombings earlier that month on the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injuring thousands. Clinton said that the target of the American strikes was \"the corruption of Bin Laden's terrorist network.\" Trump devoted a chapter to terrorism and warned widely that America could be attacked, but did not call for the elimination of bin Laden. He wrote that the United States \"should prepare for the real possibility that somewhere, at some point, he will carry a weapon of mass destruction to a major American city and blow up.\" Trump admitted that this was not his original idea, noting that \"Nightline\" ABC-TV had broadcast a series of presentations about the threat. In his comments on the media in October 27, Trump also said that \"Baghdadi hears everyone because he built this monster for a long time. But no one has ever heard of Osama bin Laden until, indeed, the World Trade Center.\" The U.S. government was aware of bin Laden a few years before the September 11 attacks. The CIA set up a unit in 1996, Alec Station, to hunt down bin Laden when he was advocating global jihad. The station was dissolved a decade later. In his 2000 book, the Governor Trump said, \"I was talking about Osama bin Laden. And I said to him, \"You have to kill him. \"Trump has inaccurately described what he wrote in his own book. The core of the only truth here is that Trump wrote about bin Laden in the context of criticism of President Clinton. Trump warned against terrorism, as others had done by the year 2000, but he did not write that Bin Laden should be taken out. This statement is often miscalculated.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00010"}
