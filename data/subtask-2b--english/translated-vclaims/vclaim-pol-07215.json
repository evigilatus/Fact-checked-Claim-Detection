In a television conversation on September 28 (and later in the daily John Stewart presentation) a month-long incident involving a congressman from Iowa, a lawyer and some rogue chickens took place in the national arena. It's one of the stories the Republicans prefer in Iowa -- that the Democratic Senate candidate is the Republic. Bruce Braley has been in a conflict with a neighbor because her chicken wanders his property on vacation, a lake house in Hollydy Lake, Iowa. There's a website, Braleychiken.com, and reports on promotional rubber chicken. The Provincial Political Action Commission Carl Ruff Crossroads issued a declaration in July attacking Berley because of the conflict. In De Moin on September 28, Republican Senate candidate Johnny Ernest was well prepared with irony about what the chicken accident said about Berley as leader. Ernest and Prally compete for successful democratic retirement, Tom Harken, in one of the country's most intense and monitored Senate competitions. \"Kungrsman, you threatened to sue a neighbor on the chicken that came to your property,\" said Ernest. \"You're talking about the two parties. How do we expect Iowa to think you're gonna work through the corridor when you can't walk through your yard?\" \"That's not true,\" Barley answered. \"I never threatened to sue anyone.\" The chicken incident, which occurred in July, was well reported. However, we questioned their disagreement in the debate. Did Braley threaten to sue or not? There was a real dispute over the chicken, but we didn't find evidence of a threatened lawsuit against the neighbor. The back story of The Braley, Pauline Hampton, keeps the chicken in its backyard as pets and therapeutic animals. These chickens were previously uninhabited and sometimes wandered into Praley's property, and Caroline, Burley's wife, claimed she could smell it. Hampton says she didn't know that the chicken was bothering her neighbors until last spring, when she told Caroline Braley Hampton that she would file a complaint with the neighborhood homeowners' association. The neighborhood rules say, \"No animals or birds, except domestic pets, must stay on any piece.\" (Brilli was not the only inhabitants of Lake Holliday who had problems with chicken, according to Yahoo and Washington Post, both of whom interviewed other residents of Lake Holliday. Caroline Braley &apos; s complaint was received at the May meeting of the district assembly council. The board ruled that chickens are really pets, and Hamptons can keep them as long as they fence in their yards. You solved the problem? Well, not quite. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, no legal action seems to have been taken. Why do Republicans continue to say that Berley threatened to sue the chicken? After settling the matter, Republican Governor Iowa, broke the story after I got a series of e-mails. It shows that Berley contacted the district association's lawyer about a week after the Council's decision on Hampton Chicken, complaining of the Council's \"inactivity\" and saying that he believes that \"the chicks are not pets and should not be allowed to do so in Lake Holliday.\" The Iowa Republic handled these e-mails as a smoking weapon. However, these e-mails - between the lawyer, the board of the neighbourhood and the barali association - do not say anywhere that Berley was considering a lawsuit. In fact, they say the opposite. Counsel Thomas Lacina wrote: \"Mr. Braly's impression was that he wanted to avoid a \"worshipping situation.\" \"The Republicans in Iowa say that the fact that Braley, a former lawyer at the trial, hinted at a \"intriguing case\" is sufficient evidence that he was considering a lawsuit -- but it still doesn't prove it conclusively. One explanation for the e-mail is that Braley told the lawyer that he wanted to \"avoid judicial status,\" but he'd sue him if he had to. But another explanation is that Braley told the lawyer that he planned \"to avoid a judicial situation\" under all circumstances. The point is, we don't know what was going on in Burley's head or details of the private conversations he had with his wife and lawyer -- nor Ernest. By the way -- Jeff Patch, author of the story of Iowa Republic, is now Director of Communications for the Republican Party in Iowa. A Burley spokesman told us that \"The lawsuit was never part of the picture at all -- and there was never any threat from any lawsuit. Any allegations to the contrary are false.\" \"I've just reached out to someone I know who expects to receive a phone call again and instead this thing explodes,\" said Burley Washington Post. In an interview with Polly Fuckett, Hampton said that Berley never threatened to sue her -- although she was under the impression that he threatened to sue the neighborhood assembly council. A member of the Council in a local newspaper, the Quad Times, said that he believed there was a lawsuit in the air, while the Vice-President of the Council said that he never thought that that was a serious possibility. We called the neighborhood council, but they refused to comment and hung up the phone. We would also like to note that the original Republican story in Iowa says that IAIA's lawyer paid an invoice to the Council for approximately $1,700 on the dispute, but the budget document does not specify that the costs are directly related to Barley's interaction with the lawyer. In addition, the Vice-President of the Board of Directors of the \"Quad City Times\" said that the figure was not quite accurate, and that the Society's attorney \"takes a number of household chores and has a monthly budget.\" Governor Ernest said that Braley threatened to sue a neighbor for the chicken that came into his property. Some may not like the way that Braley and his wife have dealt with a conflict with a neighbor -- by going to a neighbor's association and then consulting with a lawyer. However, there is no material evidence that Burley threatened to sue the neighbor or even thought of a lawsuit. Even neighbors say so. We're assessing Ernest that he wasn't superior.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07215"}
