Carson, who completed his stay in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and trained there for years, said that with the right mix of smart policy and package, American urban centres could be reactivated, citing an example from the eastern hemisphere. \"You're looking at homelessness,\" Carson, Minister of Housing and Urban Development, told journalists July 31. \"Take a city like Tokyo, which has more people than New York City. There's no displacement there. Really? That's an exaggeration, of course. But if you ring the numbers about Tokyo and her homeless population, you'll see Carson not far. The Government of Japan estimates in Japan that the number of displaced persons in Tokyo is about 1,200, according to data for the 2018s. This represents 0.092 per cent of the city &apos; s population or less than one displaced person per 10,000 inhabitants. In contrast, the number of displaced people in New York City is approximately 79,000 out of 8.6 million, an estimated 92 per 10,000, and also less than 1 per cent, like Tokyo. This graph illustrates the disparity. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, of the approximately 600,000 inhabitants of Baltimore, some 2,500 are homeless, less than 1 per cent of the total population, and it translates into some 42 homeless persons per 10,000 inhabitants. At the national level, the Japanese Government has said that just under 5,000 homeless people in the entire country are out of 126 million. This represents only 0.0039 per cent of the total population. A HUD spokesman said, \"Carson was talking about homelessness in Japan being practical at zero.\" When Japan published its data last year, the Ministry of Social Welfare of the Government stated that the number represented a decrease of 15 years. The Ministry has recognized government programs, including advice, for reduction, according to The Japan Times. According to experts, Japan &apos; s access to its displaced population is among a range of factors that explain the significant disparity in displacement rates in Japan and the United States. Jeffrey Kingston from Temple University campus in Japan said: \"The Tokyo government has made a concerted push to reduce numbers and provide shelter more than ever before.\" \"More advice and awareness - as in the case of going to places where displaced persons gather and provide support and advice - has helped to significantly reduce the number of displaced persons. Efforts to gain confidence and provide care have helped.\" Kingston said that some Japanese displaced persons, who might prefer to live on the streets and hesitate to accept aid, were increasingly dependent on government support as they age and accumulate health problems. \"They had to stop \"living rough\" even though many preferred it,\" Kingston said, citing a common metaphor for displaced populations in Japan. Tokyo recognized that the official number of displaced populations may be below the required number. The Government reached its number by surveying the number of people living in public places such as river basins and public parks. The methodology has received some criticism because it is likely to ignore less visible segments of the displaced population, including those who practice the well-documented practice of using Internet cafes or saunas. (For information: U.S. lawyers say that we are also likely to reduce the number of displaced people.) The governor Carson said there's no homeless in Tokyo. Carson better say there's no homeless people. But his general point is correct. The Tokyo Government places the displaced population at approximately 1,200. In a city of about 13.5 million people, or about 0.092 per cent of the population. We assess his claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00374"}
