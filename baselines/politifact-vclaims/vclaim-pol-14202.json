Little, the Moderate Party\u2019s candidate for attorney general, has tried to position himself as the candidate with the best experience to clean up Rhode Island\u2019s politics and environment. Among other credentials, he cites his past chairmanship of Common Cause of Rhode Island and his three years as president of Save the Bay, beginning in 1987.\n\nSo it was no surprise that someone might try to sully his Mr. Clean persona. Earlier this month, state Democratic Party Chairman Edwin R. Pacheco said Little\u2019s claim to being an environmental champion was contaminated by his private law work for polluters.\n\n\"Attorney general candidate Chris Little and his law firm have a history of working against environmental protection by defending the worst type of corporate polluters,\" Pacheco said in an Oct. 4 news release.\n\nLittle dismissed Pacheco\u2019s charges, saying \"Mr. Pacheco, you need to actually read these cases you\u2019re citing. If you do you will find that I was actually trying to help preserve the environment.\"\n\nAn open invitation to look at the record. How could we refuse?\n\nPacheco cites three instances in which he claims Little represented clients who were polluters:\n\n* Two Massachusetts towns that took the federal Environmental Protection Agency to court over a proposed sludge\u00a0 dump\n\n* A chemical company whose North Carolina facility was designated a hazardous waste site\n\n* A Massachusetts-based gasoline station operator that was fined for a gasoline spill in Brockton\n\nWe\u2019ll look at them one-by-one.\n\nThe EPA suit\n\nPacheco\u2019s first claim involves the Massachusetts towns of Walpole and Norfolk, which challenged a 1989 federal Environmental Protection Agency study that said it was environmentally safe to build a landfill for dried sewage sludge in Walpole.\n\nPacheco\u2019s news release said the EPA found \"the towns violated water pollution laws. \u2026 Chris Little was on the side of polluters and lost.\"\n\nThat case stemmed from the 1980s effort to clean up Boston Harbor. New filtration plants were built to purify sewage effluent before it was discharged into the harbor. But the new plants generated sludge, which had to be dumped somewhere. In 1989, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority decided that somewhere was in Walpole, near the Norfolk town line.\n\nThe towns objected and sued the EPA, claiming the EPA\u2019s environmental impact study failed to address environmental threats the landfill would pose.\n\nLittle \u2014 who was with Tillinghast, Collins & Graham at the time \u2014 said he joined the effort in 1989 or 1990 on Norfolk\u2019s behalf, after he\u2019d represented the Rhode Island town of Richmond in its successful fight to stop a 70-acre landfill from being built there.\n\nA federal district court judge ruled for the EPA, finding that the agency had considered the issues and met the federal standards for an impact study.\n\nIn the end, the dump was never built. In 1993, after lobbying by the state, the EPA agreed to a plan to have the dried sludge trucked to dumps in Utah.\n\nPacheco bases his criticism of Little on a summary of the suit on LexisNexis, an Internet data base, which said \"the EPA found that the towns had violated the Water Pollution Control Act...\"\n\nHowever, the judge\u2019s decision shows that summary was inaccurate. Rather than violating water pollution control laws, the towns were trying to get them enforced more stringently. In fact, the ruling shows it was Little\u2019s client who sought tougher environmental law enforcement.\n\nThe North Carolina company\n\nPacheco's news release said: In 1988, Little's law firm continued their quest against environmental protection when his firm defended a company that had a history of contaminating drinking water supplies.\"\n\nThat company was National Starch and Chemical, a North Carolina firm that makes chemicals for textile and furniture makers.\n\nPacheco\u2019s statement cites a 1980s case in which National Starch was cited for storing 350,000 gallons of liquid waste in unlined trenches on its property. Because of the threat to local drinking water wells, the EPA ordered it to clean up the site.\n\nLittle did represent National Starch, but it was in a case in Rhode Island, not North Carolina.\n\nNational Starch was among several companies that used a New Jersey company to dispose of their waste.\n\nThe companies thought their waste was going to an incinerator in New Jersey, but instead it was taken to Rhode Island, where it was illegally dumped at the Davis site in Smithfield, later designated as a Superfund site.\n\nThe company agreed to pay $5 million toward the cleanup; Little represented it in subsequent lawsuits to recover that money from the disposal company that misled it.\n\nLittle maintains his work for National Starch wasn\u2019t to defend a polluter but to make sure the real guilty party paid financially.\n\nThe oil company\n\nPacheco\u2019s third claim involved legal work Little did for gasoline station owner Mutual Oil of Massachusetts. His news release says Mutual Oil was fined $50,000 by the state for spilling gasoline at a station it owned in Brockton, a claim we verified through the Massachusetts attorney general\u2019s report for fiscal year 2002.\n\nLittle did represent Mutual Oil, but not in that case. Instead, it was in a Rhode Island zoning dispute. In 1999 a developer wanted to build a gas station in a Stop & Shop shopping center on Mendon Road, in Cumberland, near the Blackstone River.\n\nA group of local gas station owners that wanted to stop a new competitor convinced the zoning board to reject the plan, in part because the gas station would have been built on a floodplain of the Blackstone River. Little said Mutual Oil financed his work on behalf of the local station owners.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nPacheco was wrong when he said Little \"was on the side of the polluters\" in the Massachusetts sludge case.\n\nHe was correct when he said Little represented a North Carolina company that caused pollution problems in that state. But Little\u2019s representation of the company had nothing to do with that case.\n\nHe was correct when he said a Little client had been fined for a spill in Massachusetts. But again, Little\u2019s representation of the company had nothing to do with that spill.\n\nBottom line: None of the cases Pacheco cites supports his attack on Little.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe rate his statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14202"}
