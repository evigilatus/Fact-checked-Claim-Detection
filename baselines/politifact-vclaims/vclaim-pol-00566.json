It\u2019s also appeared elsewhere online and in books, often as an anecdote in which Einstein, as a student, challenges his professor.\nSearching for the quote online, we couldn\u2019t find any credible sources confirming that Einstein said this. We did find it in stories like this one from Gizmodo in 2014: \"9 Albert Einstein quotes that are totally fake.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA letter Einstein wrote in 1954 perhaps better captures the physicist\u2019s ideas about a higher power. In it, he said: \"The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive, legends which are nevertheless pretty childish.\"\nA 1996 biography of Einstein says he was religious as a child, the Guardian reported last year, but by the time he was a teenager he \"abandoned his uncritical religious fervor, feeling that he had been deceived into believing lies.\"\nThe newspaper quotes Nick Spencer, a fellow at a Christian think tank called Theos, who said: \"Einstein offers scant consolation to either party in this debate. His cosmic religion and distant deistic God fits neither the agenda of religious believers or that of tribal atheists. As so often during his life, he refused and disturbed the accepted categories. We do the great physicist a disservice when we go to him to legitimize our belief in God or in his absence.\nWe rate the claims in these Facebook posts as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00566"}
