Large quantities of fentanyl, other opioids, and other dangerous and illicit drugs are flowing across our southern border and into our country at unprecedented levels, destroying the lives of our families and loved ones,\" the memorandum says.\nIn line with this initiative, Vice President Mike Pence, during a April 25, 2018, speech at the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee said:\n\"Our president also promised to secure our borders and enforce our laws. \u2026 As I stand before you today, illegal crossings at our southern border have been cut by over 40 percent.\"\nThe 40 percent decrease figure is often bandied about by administration officials.\nIs it accurate?\nThe evidence\nIn January 2018, the Department of Homeland Security announced the U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s apprehension numbers for the previous year.\n\"The final border apprehension numbers of 2017, specifically at the southern border, undeniably prove the effectiveness of President Trump\u2019s commitment to securing our borders,\" said Tyler Q. Houlton, acting press secretary, in the release. \"This administration has overseen a 40 percent decrease in 2017 compared with the last year of Obama\u2019s presidency. U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions in Fiscal Year 2017 were at the lowest level in 45 years.\"\nBut untangling the numbers is not so easy.\nLet\u2019s step back.\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security figures, in Fiscal Year 2017 the U.S. Border Patrol caught 303,916 people crossing the southern border, down from 408,870 in 2016 -- a drop of 25.6 percent.\nThat\u2019s not 40 percent.\nWe turned to the vice president\u2019s office, but they did not respond to our requests for comment.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile,\u00a0a public affairs officer with the Department of Homeland Security\u00a0said the 40 percent figure is correct and told PolitiFact Wisconsin to \"Google it.\" The officer also cited an earlier fact check by our colleagues at PolitiFact National, which checked this March 13, 2017, claim from Trump:\nIn the first full month of my administration following the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent.\nPolitifact National rated the claim Mostly True. \u00a0\nIt found that according to a Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2017 chart, apprehensions by border patrol along the U.S.-Mexico border decreased about 40 percent, from 31,576 in January 2017 to 18,754 in February 2017.\nBut that 40 percent decrease refers to a one-month drop. And the figure is greatly outdated -- there is now more than a year of data to work with since Trump took office.\nThe spokesman also sent us a link to a Dec. 5, 2017, National Public Radio article, which noted arrests for illegal border crossings had hit a 46-year low. That article also references a drop, but it reports one much smaller than 40 percent.\n\"Border officers apprehended 310,531 people for being in the country illegally in fiscal 2017, a 25 percent decrease from the year before\" the article states.\nAnd it provides a slightly skewed picture: The 310,531 apprehensions in 2017 is a nationwide figure. According to the Homeland Security report \"CBP Border Security Report, Fiscal Year 2017,\" of the national total, 303,916 were along the southern border.\nIn any case, that brings us back to the percentage drop we started with.\nBut the fiscal year measure is not a perfect one. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1, so Fiscal Year 2017 takes in the final few months under President Barack Obama.\nSo, let\u2019s try a few other ways.\nTrump took office in January 2017, when the monthly apprehension figure was at 31,576. A year later, in January 2018, monthly apprehensions were at 25,978 -- a drop of about 18 percent (less than half the boasted about 40 percent).\nWhat\u2019s more, the situation flips when you use subsequent months to make the same comparison. That is, monthly apprehensions were higher in February 2018 than February 2017; higher in March 2018 than March 2017, and higher in April 2018 than April 2017.\nA look at the most recent month-to-month changes -- the approach Trump used in his initial boast\u00a0-- shows that from February 2018 to March 2018, there was an increase of nearly 40 percent. And from March to April, there was an increase of about 2.3 percent.\nOur rating\nPence said \"Illegal crossings at our southern border have been cut by over 40 percent.\"\nThe most recent official fiscal year numbers show a much smaller drop of about 26 percent. And the latest month-to-month numbers show an increase, not a decrease in apprehensions.\nWe rate Pence\u2019s claim False.
