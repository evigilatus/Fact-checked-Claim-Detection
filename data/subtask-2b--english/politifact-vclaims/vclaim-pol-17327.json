The new rules are different from what Booker asked for, and they don\u2019t guarantee that Bloomberg will earn a spot on stage.\nDebate qualification requirements have gradually changed\u00a0\nFor the DNC\u2019s first two debates, candidates qualified by meeting one of two requirements: Polling at 1% in three national or early-state polls approved by the DNC, or getting donations from 65,000 unique donors, with at least 200 donors per state in 20 different states.\u00a0\nOver time, the requirements became more difficult to satisfy. At the September debate in Houston, the thresholds for polling and donors increased, and candidates were required to meet both benchmarks, not one or the other.\nBy the time of the January debate in Des Moines, Iowa \u2014 the seventh on the DNC\u2019s schedule \u2014 the polling threshold had risen to 5% in four national polls or 7% in two early-state polls, and the donor threshold bumped up to 225,000 donors, with 1,000 per state in 20 different states.\nThen came the February debates, the first contests scheduled to take place after voters and caucus-goers started making their picks for a nominee.\nFor the Feb. 7 debate in New Hampshire, the DNC announced that while candidates could still qualify by meeting both the polling and donor thresholds set for the January debate, they could also qualify by earning one delegate to the national convention in the Iowa caucuses. (Bloomberg hasn\u2019t campaigned in Iowa.)\nFor the Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas, the DNC has eliminated the donor requirement entirely. Candidates can either qualify by polling at 10% in four national polls or 12% in two early-state polls, or by getting one delegate in either the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary. (Bloomberg\u2019s name won\u2019t appear on the New Hampshire ballot.)\n\n\u00a0\nAdrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the DNC, told Politico that the early primary results will give a greater window into a candidate\u2019s support than the donor tally.\n\"The donor threshold was appropriate for the opening stages of the race, when candidates were building their organizations, and there were no metrics available outside of polling to distinguish those making progress from those who weren\u2019t,\" she said, according to Politico.\nThe DNC\u2019s recent change makes room for Bloomberg\nBloomberg\u2019s refusal to take donations precluded him from participating in the DNC\u2019s first seven debates, and because he is skipping the early states, he is unlikely to win the delegates in Iowa or New Hampshire that could put him in the ring for the Feb. 7 debate.\nBut since candidates can qualify for the Feb. 19 debate simply by hitting the 10% polling mark, Bloomberg, who had called for the DNC to get rid of the donor requirement, now has a shot.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Currently, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have met the 10% polling threshold, according to Politico, which tracks public polling and has identified just one poll that has Bloomberg at 10%.\u00a0\nWatson told us Trump\u2019s suggestion that the change was meant to help Bloomberg was \"false.\"\n\"With the primary underway, we are assessing a candidate\u2019s support through a significantly higher polling threshold and through actual election results,\" she said. \"We were always planning to do this, we signaled it many times, it is not designed to benefit any one candidate, and every candidate has an equal opportunity to qualify.\"\nDNC Chairman Tom Perez did signal in November and December that he was considering doing away with the donor threshold for the early 2020 debates, according to reports.\nStill, other Democratic candidates have denounced the change, saying the DNC is catering to the billionaire.\nThe DNC didn\u2019t change the rules to ensure good, diverse candidates could remain on the debate stage. They shouldn\u2019t change the rules to let a billionaire on. Billionaires shouldn't be allowed to play by different rules\u2014on the debate stage, in our democracy, or in our government.\u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 31, 2020 \n\u00a0\nA Sanders adviser said the change was evidence of a \"rigged system.\" Warren tweeted that the DNC was letting Bloomberg \"play by different rules.\" Entrepreneur Andrew Yang said the change was \"clearly tailor made to deliver (Bloomberg) to the debate stage.\"\nBooker, Yang asked for different changes\nIn December, Booker led a push to lower qualification standards so that he, Julian Castro and others would stand a better chance of making the January and February debates.\nThe New Jersey senator sent a letter, signed by several candidates, requesting that the DNC go back to requiring candidates to meet the polling threshold or the donor threshold, but not both.\nThe DNC rejected Booker\u2019s petition. \"Our qualification criteria is extremely low and reflects where we are in the race,\" the committee said in a statement, per Politico. \"Once voting starts in February, our criteria will reflect those contests, which is more than appropriate.\"\nSimilarly, Yang asked the DNC to commission more polls so candidates would have a higher likelihood of meeting the polling requirement.\u00a0\nBoth of these changes would have made the path to the debates easier.\u00a0\nWhile the DNC has now scrapped the donor requirement and given candidates the option of qualifying through delegates or the polls, it has also doubled the polling threshold, a change that could potentially cut the number of candidates who qualify for the Nevada debate.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the donor threshold was not usually the requirement keeping candidates from the debates. Bloomberg is the only candidate who failed to qualify for a debate specifically because of the donor requirement, according to Politico.\u00a0\nBut it wasn\u2019t nothing. Booker campaign staffers, for example, have described having to divert resources in order to satisfy the committee\u2019s donor thresholds.\u00a0\nOh, do you mean the day I literally Control+A+ Deleted a plan for a whole entire early game, early state persuasion strategy and used the money to buy email addresses instead?
