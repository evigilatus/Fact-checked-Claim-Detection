(President Donald Trump) placed a $297 million contract on a vendor to show him how to employ the Border Patrol. So, the first batch they made was $14.8 million. Do you know how many border patrols they hired with $14.8 million? Second, \"Queller said during a press conference held on 22 February in Laredo, Texas. Has only two border patrol personnel been contracted under $14.8 million paid for the first time in a $297 million contract? The large-scale allegation made by Quillar about a disorderly recruitment process is an accurate one. However, his statement overlooks some details, and the dollar figure he mentioned is slightly higher than the initial payment. Koelar's claim was based on the government's report referring to \"serious performance issues\" in the contract. The federal government faced problems in finding and keeping people serving as border patrol agents, and therefore decided to go to the private sector for help. In November 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection awarded a $297 million contract for federal services in Axentor, which could help the Government recruit and lease 7,500 qualified candidates over five years. The posts to be filled are border patrol agents, customs and border protection officers and air and maritime interdiction agents. The contract was reviewed by the Office of the Inspector General of the Ministry of Internal Security in response to complaints from the contract hotline. In a report issued in December 2018, the Inspector General &apos; s Office stated that Accenture did not achieve the recruitment process or promised results and relied on government resources to meet its obligations. The report detailed several other concerns. \"CBP risks wasting millions of taxpayers on a contract approved in haste that does not meet the proposed performance expectations,\" said the report. \"CBP must hold the contractor accountable, mitigate risks and develop a strategy to ensure results without additional government costs.\" As at 1 October 2018, 10 months after the conclusion of the contract, customs and border protection had paid Accenture approximately $13.6 million for start-up costs, security requirements, recruitment and support for applicants. \"In contrast, AcCenture handled two acceptable job offers,\" said the report. The Koelar office stated that its claim was based on this conclusion. The Inspector General &apos; s Office reported that these offers, which were accepted by Accenture, were for a border patrol officer and a customs and border protection officer. (Police officers work at ports of entry and do not necessarily leave for patrol duties.) The Government recognizes the challenges, but states that the $13.6 million was not useless in customs and border protection, and referred the Politi Vac document to a statement issued after the publication of the report. \"while excluding some of the company's description of the contract, we agree that the contract was a challenge, mainly because of the innovative efforts of both parties, and we are now reviewing the best way to use it to move forward,\" as part of the statement said. The Inspector General &apos; s report also included the customs and border protection response to the audit. The Agency stated that it was inaccurate to say that the $13.6 million resulted in only two acceptable job offers, because Accenture also \"established a staffing structure, technology solutions specifically designed to support and manage the recruitment process, stopped the applicant's care centre, marketed and employed thousands of new applicants, and took many recruitment steps for several thousand applicants.\" On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021 The Inspector General replied to this reply: \"while we acknowledge that the Customs and Border Protection Office has worked with Accenture to establish employment activities, we maintain our statement that such activities have resulted in only two acceptable job offers as of 1 October 2018.\" One of the issues referred to in the report was the period when neither Accenture nor Customs nor Border Protection was able to identify applicants nominated by Accenture, owing to restrictions on the Bureau of Management and Budget and privacy concerns. Also, Accenture does not always provide the human resources and personnel required to carry out basic investigations. Although Aksentor said that it could provide an innovative system for tracking applicants, he used the government recruitment system instead, as the Inspector General said. Because of these deficiencies, the Government amended the contract and granted the company a temporary period of three months (March to June 2018) to resolve these issues. During this period, customs and border protection carried out many of the work that Accenture was supposed to do. Because Accenture was unable to identify the applicants it hired, the Government agreed to grant them credit and \"the temporary payment of a percentage of all applicants regardless of whether the CBP or Accumulation treated the applicants.\" \"As at 1 October 2018, the Customs and Border Protection Office had treated 14 applicants on behalf of Accumulation. The report stated that all 14 applicants accepted offers of employment and that seven of the 14 entered the service, resulting in approximately $500,000 being paid to ACCenture for the work done by the Customs and Border Protection Office.\" Therefore, despite the existence of these additional appointments, it is unclear whether they were recruited because of Akintor's recruitment efforts. The Inspector General's report says that Axentor was \"nowhere close to achieving the goal of recruiting 7,500 people over the next five years.\" Customs and border protection told Politi Fact that there were \"new tenants from Axenator\" brought on board the ship and others who had accepted offers of employment since 1 October 2018 the date referred to in the report. It is unclear how many border patrol personnel, how many were recruited and equipped exclusively by Accenture, and whether they were included in the initial payment to Accenture. Governor Quillar, Trump, said, \"He entered into a $297 million contract with a salesman to show him how to rent the border patrol. So, the first batch they made was $14.8 million. Do you know how many border patrols they hired with $14.8 million? Two.\" The Trump Department awarded a $297 million contract to Axenator to assist customs and border protection in recruiting 7,500 new employees over five years. This includes border patrol personnel. In its general report, an Inspector stated that as of 1 October 2018, customs and border protection had paid approximately $13.6 million for start-up costs, security requirements, recruitment and support for applicants. The report stated that, to date, the company had processed two acceptable job offers. One was a border patrol member and the other was a customs and border protection officer. The report referred to 14 other acceptable job offers processed by customs and border protection on behalf of Accenture. However, given the shortcomings of the contract, it is not clear whether these 14 were employed because of Akintori's employment. The Quillar statement is precise but needs clarification. We're mostly assessing it right.
