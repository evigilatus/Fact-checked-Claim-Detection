More women than men vote in Florida, but 26 men named William have been elected to statewide office and only 7 women have had the honor. We have to fix this in 2016.\"\nIs it possible that in Florida\u2019s 170-year history, only seven women have filled statewide office? And did voters pick 26 men named William? Get ready for a state civics lesson.\nThe Williams\nRuth\u2019s List did not respond to our repeated inquiries by phone, email and even Twitter about how they came up with their tally, so we don\u2019t know exactly what they counted. What we do know is that things can get considerably convoluted.\nDepending on whom you count and how, we found 30 men named William \u00a0-- or possibly more -- who have held statewide office. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they were elected. We\u2019re not going to go through every single one, but if you\u2019d like to see all the ones we found, we\u2019ve provided our list here.\nKeep in mind that a number of the Williams on our list were appointed to their post, rather than elected, as Ruth's List Florida said. We could confirm 14 different Williams were actually elected to office, although there could be more. While we know some were appointed, historical records for a few simply didn\u2019t give enough detail about how they won office, especially during the state\u2019s early history. Those men certainly could have won via election, but we just can\u2019t tell. If we counted all the unknowns as being elected, that would total 22 Williams.\nIncreasingly in recent years, Florida has moved toward\u00a0appointments rather than direct elections. The state had six elected cabinet positions until 2003, at which point the roster was whittled to three.\nTo give you a sense of how difficult counting Williams can be, consider Florida\u2019s roster of U.S. senators: Depending on how wide you cast a net, there have been between zero and four Williams in the U.S. Senate.\nWilliam James Bryan was appointed in 1907 to succeed a man who died, but then died himself less than three months later at age 31. He was succeeded in 1908 by another appointee, William Hall Milton, who served a year and did not run for re-election. Also appointed as a successor to a dead senator was William Luther Hill, who served four months in 1936 before leaving office without running for a full term.\nFinally, there\u2019s current Sen. Bill Nelson, who has been in office since 2001 and was also state treasurer back when it was an elected position. But Nelson\u2019s full name is Clarence William Nelson. Should we count him as a William just because he goes by Bill? \u00a0\nThere are other twists, such as two appointed and two elected Supreme Court justices, one of whom went by the middle name Glenn. Also, lieutenant governors are now elected as members of a party ticket, but were elected independently until 1889, so you can add two more Williams there.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible we\u2019re missing some details here, such as a William who was elected state grapefruit juicer or state dog walker or some such. But we will concede that even if the total you come up with isn\u2019t 26, it\u2019s still way more than the number of women we counted.\nThe women\nWe counted eight different women who were actually elected to office, but we had to do some digging to reach that total.\nThe Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University keeps tabs on women in statewide executive elections, providing a list for each state. The school said that in Florida, those women are:\n\n\n\n\nName (Party)\n\n\nOffice\n\n\nYears served\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPam Bondi (R)\n\n\nAttorney general\n\n\n2011-present\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Carroll (R)\n\n\nLieutenant governor\n\n\n2011-2013\n\n\n\n\nAlex Sink (D)\n\n\nChief financial officer\n\n\n2007-2011\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToni Jennings (R)\n\n\nLieutenant governor\n\n\n2003-2007\n\n\n\n\nKatherine Harris (R)\n\n\nSecretary of state\n\n\n1999-2003\n\n\n\n\nSandra Mortham (R)\n\n\nSecretary of state\n\n\n1995-1999\n\n\n\n\nBetty Castor (D)\n\n\nEducation commissioner\n\n\n1987-1993\n\n\n\n\nPaula Hawkins (R)\n\n\nU.S. senator\n\n\n1981-1987\n\n\n\n\nPaula Hawkins (R)\n\n\nPublic service commissioner\n\n\n1973-1979\n\n\n\n\nMamie Eaton Greene\n\n\nRailroad commissioner\n\n\n1927-1934\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThat appears to be nine \u2014 with Hawkins, the state\u2019s only female senator, counted once \u2014 but remember a couple of points we\u2019ve mentioned before. First is that there are fewer offices available, so some women have been elected to positions no one can seek today.\nSecretaries of state and education commissioners have been appointed since 2003, when the cabinet was cut in half to three spots. The Florida Public Service Commission chose three members by statewide election until 1979 (three were named William, by the way), but those positions are now appointed, too.\nNext is the caveat that lieutenant governors are elected on a party ticket, not independently. When Gov. Rick Scott won, Carroll won with him. For argument\u2019s sake, we\u2019ll count that as winning an election, but it\u2019s worth noting the difference.\nAlthough she was the first female lieutenant governor, Jennings did not win by election and therefore doesn\u2019t count for our purposes. She was chosen by then-Gov. Jeb Bush to succeed Frank Brogan, and took over in March 2003 right after Bush\u2019s second term began.\nThere have been other women in Florida\u2019s offices, but very few were elected. Dorothy Glisson, for example, doesn\u2019t make this tally even though she was the first woman to serve in a Florida Cabinet position. The longtime elections supervisor was appointed secretary of state by Gov. Reubin Askew in 1974 when her predecessor ran for Senate.\nAnd finally, keep in mind that women couldn\u2019t run for office or even vote until 1920, so there are fewer decades from which to compile the list. Greene, who first got her seat as railroad commissioner because her husband died in 1927, became the first woman in Florida to win a state office when she ran for re-election in 1928.\nIt\u2019s hard to discern if a single-digit total, however you count it, means Florida is really lagging behind other states, though.\nKathy Kleeman, the communications director at the Rutgers center, said because every state organizes differently, there\u2019s no baseline for everyone to follow. Maine\u2019s governor, for instance, is the state\u2019s only statewide executive position. Georgia and North Dakota, meanwhile, have 13 positions that the center counts on its list.\n\"All of this makes comparing numbers almost meaningless and percentages not a whole lot better,\" Kleeman said. \"Still, seven \u2014 or even nine, as we show on our website \u2014 isn't very many in all those years, any way you cut it.\"\nOur ruling\nRuth\u2019s List Florida said that \"26 men named William have been elected to statewide office and only seven women have had the honor.\"\nBecause of changes in state government and elections, plus how officeholders came by their positions, it\u2019s difficult to parse the exact count the group came up with. The total of officials we could confirm were elected and not appointed was 14 Williams (although there could be more) and eight women. That\u2019s off from the numbers in the email, but the gist of the statement is still defensible. There have been many more men named William than women holding major elected offices in Florida.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05923"}
