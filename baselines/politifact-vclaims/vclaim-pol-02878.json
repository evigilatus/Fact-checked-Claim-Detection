Before the Affordable Care Act, insurers could deny coverage to people who had cancer, asthma or some other illness. The law banned that practice.\n\"I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions,\" Trump tweeted. \"It does! A great Bill. Repeal & Replace.\"\nI would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal & Replace.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017\n\nTrump is not entirely wrong, but his tweet papers over some pitfalls in what the bill offers.\nThe key section lies in the bill\u2019s rules for state waivers from many regulations in the Affordable Care Act (starting at page 8 in the bill.) If a state says it \"intends to maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions,\" then it can allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones.\nUnder the current rules, insurance companies can\u2019t do that. They can\u2019t factor in health, period. In addition, current Affordable Care Act\u00a0rules limit the range for premiums and say companies can\u2019t charge an older person more than three times what they charge a younger person.\nThe waiver does away with those limits (starting at the bottom of page 12 in the bill). A state\u2019s commitment boils down to maintaining \"access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage.\"\n\"That\u2019s not nothing\" in terms of protecting people with pre-existing conditions, said Indiana University health care law professor David Gamage.\nBut beyond that, Gamage said the protection for pre-existing conditions gets murky.\n\"The bill says states have to do something, but what that something is is unclear,\" Gamage said. \"And it\u2019s overwhelmingly likely that what some states do will won\u2019t be as robust as what people have now.\"\nThe health consulting firm Avalere found that 34 states plus the District of Columbia would see net funding cuts under the bill sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham. The Kaiser Family Foundation had a similar finding. One way or another, it costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it.\nOn top of that, Gamage said, Affordable Care Act regulations spread some of the costs across the private sector. Those regulations would go away, too, meaning\u00a0it would be up to the states to make up the difference.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCassidy\u00a0spokesman Ty Bofferding disagreed.\n\"We have guaranteed issue and expect states to use invisible risk-sharing (where states reimburse insurers for higher cost people) or other policies to cover pre-existing conditions or face misuse of funds penalties,\" Bofferding said.\nThat might be a sincere hope, said law professor Wendy Netter Epstein at DePaul University, but the bill\u2019s language doesn\u2019t back it up.\n\"The terms \u2018adequate\u2019 and \u2018affordable\u2019 are very much subject to interpretation,\" Epstein said. \"What is adequate and affordable for one person may not be for another. \u00a0And it almost certainly doesn\u2019t mean that those with pre-existing conditions have to be charged the same as those without.\"\nIf states fell short, Epstein said Washington regulators could try to hold their feet to the fire and press them to do better with their federal money, but \"we can anticipate a whole lot of litigation.\" And even a win for Washington might not mean much in practice.\n\"Folks who are sick and need health insurance coverage now don\u2019t have the luxury of time to let these legal debates play out,\" Epstein said.\nBoth Epstein and Gamage said in theory, states might find ways to squeeze much more health coverage out of each dollar. Or failing that, they might decide to put much more of their own money into health care and re-establish rules modeled on the Affordable Care Act. But they said neither outcome is likely.\nEpstein said there\u2019s an underlying disagreement on what it means to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Under the Affordable Care Act, those people got the same kind of coverage at the same price as others.\n\"But that\u2019s not what President Trump and Sen.\u00a0Cassidy mean when they say that the bill continues to require coverage for people with pre-existing conditions,\" Epstein said. \"They mean that insurers will have to continue to cover people, but not at the same rates. And the policies don\u2019t have to provide the same coverage.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump said the Graham-Cassidy bill does include coverage of pre-existing conditions.\nThe bill does address pre-existing conditions, and if states want billions of dollars in federal aid, they must show they intend to keep coverage accessible and affordable.\nBut the other parts of the bill allow states to give insurance companies a free hand in charging those people higher premiums. Professors who study the U.S. health care system said the bill\u2019s language protecting people with pre-existing conditions is vague and subject to broad interpretation.\nPlus, they said the bill\u2019s reduction in funds going to two-thirds of the states will make it harder for them to protect people with past health problems. Under no circumstances do the protections in the bill equal the ones Americans have today under the Affordable Care Act. They are less.\nThere\u2019s an element of truth in Trump\u2019s tweet but it obscures critical details. We rate this claim Mostly False.
