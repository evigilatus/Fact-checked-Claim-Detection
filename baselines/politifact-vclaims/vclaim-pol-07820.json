Morgan, a member of the Georgia House since 2003, voted in favor of an amended 2010 state budget that included cuts to the program for disabled preschoolers, as well to a program giving scholarships to special needs students who want to attend private schools. (The amended budget -- House Bill 947 -- passed in 2010, with 122 yes votes, including Morgan\u2019s, and 44 no votes, so an argument could be made that the budget would have passed without Morgan\u2019s vote.)\nBut there\u2019s more to the story.\nFirst of all, these cuts were made when Georgia and the nation were in the aftermath of what\u2019s come to be known as the Great Recession. In January 2010, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue was asking lawmakers -- Morgan included -- \u00a0to cut $1.2 billion out of a budget that had already been in place for six months.\nRevenue was bleak -- down $136 million, or 8.7 percent, just for that month.\nThe program to help disabled 3- and 4-year-olds be better prepared for school didn\u2019t escape the cutting. Neither did the special needs scholarship program.\nThe $29 million budget for the preschool disabled program was cut about $2 million. About $1 million of that came from furloughing employees and cuts to employer insurance premiums \u00a0--- something that was done across all of state government.\nMorgan\u2019s campaign points out that the preschool budget was cut by a smaller percentage, nearly 6.9 percent, than most departments. Records show state spending to pre-school was cut less than many departments, such as Agriculture, Economic Development, Natural Resources and the Regents System.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding for the private school scholarships was cut $4 million, and officials in the House Budget Office say that was based strictly on the state\u2019s education funding formula.\nIt\u2019s true that the state budget can, in theory, be amended when it hits the floor of either the House or Senate.\nRule 108.3 spells out the protocol in the House. \"No amendment to any appropriations bill shall be in order if the amendment has the effect of both reducing one appropriation and either increasing another appropriation or adding a new appropriation. No amendment to any appropriations bill increasing any appropriation or adding a new appropriation shall be in order unless there has previously been adopted an amendment reducing some other appropriation so as to make funds available for such new or increased appropriation; and no amendment to any appropriations bill shall be in order which would cause the bill to violate the balanced budget requirements of the Constitution.\"\nLongtime observers say floor amendments to the budget have been tried a few times, but rarely.\nMichael Brewer, Morgan\u2019s deputy campaign manager, said the claims in Wilson\u2019s flier are \"intellectually disingenuous, at best.\"\nThey overlook the tough economic times and the state\u2019s obligation to balance its budget and pay its bills, he said.\n\"Tough choices were made to tighten the state\u2019s belt, so to speak, without raising taxes on Georgia families during the difficult economic recession,\" Brewer said. \"Cuts were made across the board to every state agency and department, and legislators did everything they could to reduce and stymie those cuts to education.\"\nIn the 2014 state budget approved by lawmakers last year, funding for the preschool disabled program was back to $29 million, the amount it was before the 2010 midyear cuts, he pointed out. Morgan also voted in favor of that budget.\nIn summary, Wilson is correct that Morgan voted for an amended state budget for 2010 that included cuts to the preschool disabled program and a scholarship program for special needs students.\nBut a lot of context is needed to understand the claim.\nThe state was in economic hard times in 2010, and cuts were being ordered across all state agencies, with sign-off from a majority of the General Assembly, not just Morgan. These programs represent a small fraction of the state\u2019s multibillion-dollar annual budget.\nPolitiFact has encountered many cases where candidates accuse elected officials of supporting cuts without noting that these votes were parts of larger budget decisions.\nWilson\u2019s attack against Morgan omits key context. It is accurate but misleading. \u00a0\nWe rate the statement as Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07820"}
