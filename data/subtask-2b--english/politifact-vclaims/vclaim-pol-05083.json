One area of common ground is U.S. funding for NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nTrump has raised the specter of America pulling out of the military alliance if the Europeans don\u2019t pick up a bigger share. At the Democratic debate in Brooklyn, N.Y. on April 14, 2016, Sanders didn\u2019t go quite that far, but he certainly talked about the problem in similar terms.\nA panelist quoted Sanders\u2019 own words on NATO from 1997. Back then he said, \"It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe.\"\nAsked if he still felt that way during the debate, Sanders said, \"We spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO. Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense.\"\nDoes the United States pay\u00a0as large a share of NATO military spending as Sanders said?\nWhen we originally heard this item, we thought Sanders had it right. We originally published this fact-check moments after the April 14 debate as True. But very quickly, we discovered that Sanders didn\u2019t describe the 75 percent statistic entirely accurately. We removed that fact-check from our database and are taking a fresh look here.\nWarren Gunnels, policy director for the Sanders campaign, referred us to a Wall Street Journal article about how few NATO members meet the alliance\u2019s defense spending targets. On paper, members say they will put at least 2 percent of their GDP into their militaries.\nIn practice, only five do: the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece, Estonia and Poland.\n\"Sen. Sanders made the point that our NATO allies should pick up more of the burden for their defense, citing the fact that the United States spends about 75 percent of NATO's total military expenditures,\" Gunnels said.\nWe went to the latest NATO budget report.\nBy NATO\u2019s count, total defense spending of all NATO members stood at about $900 billion in 2015 in current dollars. The United States\u2019 share was about $650 billion. Do the math, and the percentage comes to about 72 percent.\nHere are the top four top countries on NATO\u2019s list:\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n\n\nSpending (millions)\n\n\nPercent of total\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n$649,931\n\n\n72.2%\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n$59,699\n\n\n6.6%\n\n\n\n\nFrance\n\n\n$43,864\n\n\n4.9%\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n\n\n$39,743\n\n\n4.4%\n\n\n\n\nNATO total\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$900,473\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBut we need to understand what these numbers show. They don\u2019t represent dollars or euros spent on behalf of NATO, or as Sanders said, \"the military aspect of NATO.\"\nThese figures are the total defense budgets of the NATO members -- including spending on projects far from NATO\u2019s purview.\nGordon Adams, professor emeritus at American University\u2019s School of International Service, told us this is the standard approach to the question of which country brings the most to the NATO party.\n\"The comparison folks look at is overall defense spending, and by the NATO definition, the United States covers more than 70 percent of the total for all NATO members,\" Adams said.\nAdams argues that the United States pays for a global operation, part of which includes Europe. The European members mainly pay for European-based forces for use in Europe. America\u2019s equipment and personnel, Adams notes, can be used anywhere.\n\"Were there a war in Europe, U.S. defense capabilities elsewhere in the world would be swung to Europe,\" he said.\nSo even if America has sent ships to the South China Sea to discourage China\u2019s activities there, and is bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria, all that and more weighs in the balance of NATO\u2019s resources.\nThat is one view.\nLaicie Heeley, a military budget expert at the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank, sees things otherwise.\n\"Sanders' claim is a commonly quoted misperception, or misleading quote, however you choose to see it,\" Heeley said. \"The stat says nothing about the U.S. relationship to NATO. It simply states that the United States is the world's greatest military spender.\"\nLisa Samp, a fellow with the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, also describes Sanders\u2019 words as a \"common misunderstanding.\"\n\"There is a difference between what nations contribute to NATO and what they spend on their own defense,\" Samp said. \"More accurate would be to say the United States contributes 22 percent of NATO\u2019s common funding.\"\nNATO\u2019s common expenses\nNATO does have things it calls its own. There is a civilian staff and headquarters, and military equipment such as surveillance aircraft. There are bases, command headquarters and a program to beef up military capabilities in certain countries above and beyond what they would need for their own defense.\nFor 2016, NATO\u2019s total military budget is about $2 billion. (Since Sanders specified the military aspect, we\u2019ll ignore the civilian costs, which are about $200 million.)\nEach member contributes an agreed upon percentage of the shared budget. The United States leads the pack, paying 22 percent, as Samp said. This year, that comes to about $460 million. (Germany comes in second, paying about 15 percent.)\nThat is a far cry from 75 percent of NATO\u2019s military expense.\nBut while the common expenses allow us to be more precise about the money American taxpayers put into NATO, these numbers don\u2019t capture either the full picture of the U.S. presence in Europe, or NATO\u2019s true military capacity.\n\"You could not fight a war with the $2 billion,\" Adams said. \"I have to say defining (the NATO budget) that way is, to me, both irrelevant and meaningless.\"\nInterwoven goals, interwoven dollars\nThe one point that experts seem to agree on is that there is no easy way to separate America\u2019s military spending in Europe from its global military strategy.\nThe United States has responded to Russia\u2019s military moves in Ukraine with a program to boost the U.S. presence in central and eastern Europe. With a 2016 price tag just shy of $800 million, the Pentagon has put more boots on the ground, prepositioned equipment and supplies and in many other ways laid the groundwork to respond faster to any new moves Russia might make.\nSamp told us while this clearly helps defend Europe, it has greater implications.\n\"It\u2019s not just for Europe but to forward deploy and have global reach,\" she said. \"We can\u2019t say everything we\u2019re doing in Europe is just for Europe. It\u2019s for our benefit and our overall strategy as well.\"\nIn the same way that American forces around the world could be called in to help Europe, so too are American forces in Europe available to support U.S. operations elsewhere, for example in fighting ISIS in the Middle East.\n\"There is no easy way to sort out what the United States spends by region because both equipment and personnel are usable in every region of the world,\" Adams said. \u00a0\nOur ruling\nSanders said that the United States spends \"about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO.\"\nThe problem with that statement is that NATO\u2019s military resources defy easy description. There are two ways to quantify them and both are incomplete.\nThe alliance sums up the total defense budgets of its members and counts that as its resources. By that measure, the United States represents about 72 percent of NATO. But that hardly captures America\u2019s role because its defense budget is shaped by factors outside of Europe.\nOn the other hand, NATO has common military expenses on the order of $2 billion a year. The U.S. share of that is about 22 percent. But those dollars exclude the vast spending it takes to sustain American forces, equipment and bases across Europe. And in a final twist, even those expenditures aren\u2019t solely for the benefit of Europe.\nWe rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91c9f837-0e8f-4c6a-9add-a7b212c6deac", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05083"}
