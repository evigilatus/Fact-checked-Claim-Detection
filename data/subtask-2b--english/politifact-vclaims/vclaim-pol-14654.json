It\u2019s a theme as recurrent as the buzzards returning to Hinckley, and Ohio campaign managers know it works.\n\nBut Lee Fisher\u2019s campaign presented a new angle on the theme, and it is intriguing. Fisher, the Democratic lieutenant governor, is running for U.S. Senate against Rob Portman, a Republican who served for a year as President George W. Bush\u2019s trade ambassador. Portman played a key advisory role in helping the president deal with economic competition from China, whose manufacturing might rose as Ohio\u2019s declined.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear plenty more about that before November, and The Plain Dealer examined Portman\u2019s trade record in May. But Fisher presented a brand new perspective in a news release on July 13 when he complained about currency manipulation by China. Although this has been an issue for years, Fisher put some of the blame on Portman. His news release said, \"As President George W. Bush\u2019s trade representative, Portman failed to address China\u2019s currency manipulation, which was inflated to as much as 40 percent in 2006.\"\n\nThat\u2019s shorthand for saying that China propped up its currency rather than letting it rise and fall against the dollar, enabling China\u2019s factories to make steel, auto parts and toys and ship them to the United States at artificially low prices that undercut American manufacturers. It was little different from other unfair trade practices, many American manufacturers say.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear few disputes about that, whether the president is named Bush or Barack Obama. But there\u2019s plenty of bickering over what to do about it. That\u2019s where Portman comes in.\n\nPortman, a Republican, could have used his authority as trade representative to take China to the World Trade Organization and push for penalties, according to critics. But Portman was such an unabashed proponent of free trade that he gave China a pass, Fisher says.\n\nWe asked Fisher\u2019s spokesman, John Collins (who recently left to work for a candidate in Kentucky), to provide support for the claim, and he cited several news articles from early 2006. That\u2019s when Portman\u2019s office issued a lengthy and critical report on other trade practices by China. But Portman\u2019s report gave little space to currency manipulation \u2013 and that angered Sen. Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.\n\nAccording to news articles and congressional transcripts we reviewed, Schumer blasted Portman\u2019s report for failing to fully deal with the \"800-pound gorilla\" \u2013 currency manipulation -- that had to be tamed for any trade balance to occur.\n\nOK, so Portman failed to adequately mention China\u2019s currency manipulation -- according to a senator from New York -- in a report. Was that really a failure to \"address\" the problem?\n\nIt turns out the issue gets more complex.\n\nPortman didn\u2019t address the currency issue in the broader sense -- that is, embrace it as a problem he could solve -- because, his campaign says, it wasn\u2019t even under his jurisdiction. Transcripts of a confirmation hearing for Portman on April 21, 2005, show that he voiced concern about the issue but said, \"By the same token, as you know, the Treasury Department has the lead on this, appropriately. It\u2019s a currency issue, not USTR,\" he said, using the initials of U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office.\n\nHe mentioned the jurisdictional issue several more times during his stint as trade ambassador. On Feb. 16, 2006, he told Schumer during a Senate Finance Committee hearing that \"currency policy is very distinctly not within the ambit of the USTR. And I'm reminded of that constantly in the inter-agency process, which is appropriate that Treasury take the lead and that they speak for us on currency policy.\"\n\nFour days later he told it to another congressional committee: \"We need to address the currency issue, which the Treasury Department takes the lead on and not USTR.\"\n\nSo is Fisher blaming Portman for something he bore no responsibility for?\n\nThat\u2019s what Portman\u2019s spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, suggested, citing the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The act says it is the Treasury secretary\u2019s job to analyze exchange rate policies of other countries, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, and consider whether countries manipulate their currencies. If the answer is yes, Treasury is to negotiate with the offending country through the IMF.\n\nWe contacted the office of the current trade representative, Ron Kirk, an Obama appointee, to see if it agreed on the jurisdiction issue. It did. We asked Treasury as well, and Treasury said it was in fact in charge. We asked the Obama White House, too, just in case the agencies had a fuzzy view. No, said the White House. Currency manipulation is on Treasury\u2019s watch.\n\nThat cast significant doubt on Fisher\u2019s claim, then, that Portman \"failed to address\" the problem. It wasn\u2019t his job.\n\nBut we wondered if small American manufacturers agreed, so we asked a few trade experts in Washington, including attorneys who take cases to the trade courts. It turned out that the story was more complex, because on April 20, 2005, nine days before Portman was sworn in, a group of 35 senators and representatives filed a petition asking the trade representative\u2019s office to haul China before the WTO and press the currency issue as an unfair trade practice. The Congress members -- nearly all Democrats -- had grown frustrated with Treasury, saying it had failed to stop China\u2019s manipulation and that the right recourse was for the trade ambassador to go to the trade courts and ask for \u00a0tariffs against Chinese imports.\n\nA coalition of labor unions and manufacturing groups had tried this twice before, but their petitions had been rejected. But this 2005 congressional petition was different because members of Congress filed it. They included several U.S. House members from Ohio, including Democrats Tim Ryan, Stephanie Tubbs Jones (since deceased), Sherrod Brown (now a senator) and Ted Strickland (now Ohio\u2019s governor). They also included a dozen U.S. senators, including one from Illinois named Barack Obama.\n\nOn May 27, 2005, not quite a month into his term, Portman\u2019s office turned them down.\n\nHis spokesman at the agency, Richard Mills, said at the time that the Treasury secretary, John Snow, had the lead in talks with China on the currency matter and, as a result, \"Chinese officials have publicly committed that they will move to a more flexible system.\"\n\nA notice in the Federal Register said the trade office turned down the lawmakers\u2019 request \"because, among other reasons, an investigation would not be effective in addressing the acts, policies, and practices covered in the petition.\" The Bush administration was already dealing with China through Treasury, and launching a trade office investigation \"would hamper, rather than advance, administration efforts to address China\u2019s currency valuation policies.\"\n\nNeither Mills\u2019 statement nor the Federal Register notice said it was strictly a matter of jurisdiction. Mills said at the time that many tools were available \"to ensure a level playing field,\" but that the administration preferred to put Treasury in the lead.\n\nThis suggested some leeway on choice, not just jurisdiction, or so say the parties who wanted the trade representative\u2019s involvement. \"That is a major issue, and we\u2019ve always argued that it is a hybrid issue,\" says David Hartquist, a Washington trade attorney who had filed a similar petition earlier that was turned down by a Portman predecessor..\n\nCharles Blum, a trade office official in the 1980s who is now executive director of the Fair Currency Coalition, representing manufacturers, labor and agricultural interests, says that Portman \"was essentially saying, \u2018I refuse to enforce the law because diplomacy is the proper venue.\u2019\"\n\nThe question then becomes: Did Portman lack jurisdiction, or did he just believe that Treasury was the better agency to deal with the issue?\n\nKevin Dempsey, a trade lawyer and senior vice president at the American Iron and Steel Institute, which also has tried to halt unfairly priced imports, says that Congress has been fairly clear: It intended for Treasury to take the lead. Portman \"had some discretion,\" Dempsey says. \"But it\u2019s been established for some years, before Portman and after Portman, that Treasury does have the lead.\"\n\nCongress has considered changing that so currency could be treated as a trade issue in certain circumstances. Ryan and Brown are involved in \u00a0these efforts. But their measures have stalled repeatedly. \u00a0And now that he\u2019s president, even Obama has kept Treasury in the lead \u2013 and frustrated \u00a0those who want more forceful action.\n\nSo we\u2019re persuaded that in a narrow sense, Portman \"failed to address China\u2019s currency manipulation,\" as Fisher\u2019s campaign says. But he was following a long-held policy that has been articulated by Congress and presidents. The Obama administration agrees with Portman: Currency is not the trade ambassador\u2019s job. And Portman \"addressed\" it repeatedly in congressional hearings, telling Congress exactly what his campaign says today.\n\nThat\u2019s why we rate Fisher\u2019s claim Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
