Bain Capital is Romney\u2019s former company, which has been the target of accusations that it outsourced jobs, closed factories and reaped huge profits for itself.\n\n\"Do you think that it is accidental that the name of the really vicious fire-breathing, four-eyed whatever it is villain in this movie is named Bane?\" Limbaugh suggested to his listeners.\n\nYou can see our serious fact checks about Bain Capital here. For now, we thought we\u2019d take a pop-culture diversion from politics to the comic book underworld to see if Limbaugh has really uncovered an evil plot.\n\nWhat he said\n\nFrom the transcript of Limbaugh\u2019s July 17, 2012, show:\n\n\"This evil villain in the new Batman movie is named Bane. And there's now a discussion out there as to whether or not this is purposeful and whether or not it will influence voters. It's gonna have a lot of people. This movie, the audience is gonna be huge. A lot of people are gonna see the movie, and it's a lot of brain-dead people, entertainment, the pop culture crowd, and they're gonna hear Bane in the movie and they're gonna associate Bain. The thought is that when they start paying attention to the campaign later in the year, and Obama and the Democrats keep talking about Bain, Romney and Bain, that these people will think back to the Batman movie, \u2018Oh, yeah, I know who that is.\u2019 There are some people who think it'll work. Others think you're really underestimating the American people to think that will work.\"\n\nHe wrapped up:\n\n\"You may think it's ridiculous, I'm just telling you this is the kind of stuff the Obama team is lining up. The kind of people who would draw this comparison are the kind of people that they are campaigning to. These are the kind of people that they are attempting to appeal to.\"\n\nA short history of Bane\n\nSo listen up, brain-dead people. To learn more about this villain, we consulted scholarly sources such as The Essential Batman Encyclopedia, and io9, a site that covers science, science fiction and the future.\n\nBane, the encyclopedia tells us, was born in the fictional South American country of Santa Prisca and grew up in prison, forced to serve a sentence for the crimes of his father. He grows into a violent genius, who commits murder at age 8 and acquires superhuman strength after surviving experiments with a drug called Venom, which left him impossibly virile but forever reliant on the drug. The tentacled mask he wears connects to pumps that deliver regular doses.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe eventually breaks out of prison, bound for Gotham City, where he plans to overpower Batman and assume power.\n\nA compelling personal history, to be sure. But the bottom line is this: Bane entered the Batman storyline in 1993. That\u2019s more than a decade before Romney first ran for president in 2007.\n\nThink Bane creator Chuck Dixon had that much foresight? He doesn\u2019t.\n\n\"Ridiculous,\" is what Dixon called suggestions of a connection between his character and Romney\u2019s company.\n\nDixon responded on his message board to the notion, first raised by a Democrat, that the two story lines are linked.\n\n\"I saw it on FB like two hours ago,\" Dixon wrote. \"Ridiculous. Tho' I got a cold feeling in the pit of my stomach that Rush may pick up on this. And (that) would be the second time he pegged me and (co-creator) Graham (Nolan) as liberals on his show.\"\n\nLimbaugh hadn\u2019t yet weighed in, but Dixon showed his crafty knack for foreshadowing. He\u2019s no liberal -- he identifies as a conservative.\n\nNot that he minds the publicity.\n\n\"Overgrasping Dems? Hey, if it gets Obama supporters into theaters. Maybe they'll buy thousands of Bane toys to throw at Romney. It all adds to MY Bane capital. I wonder if the Romney campaign will contact me?\" Dixon wrote.\n\nWe\u2019ve also read several commentaries that find a more obvious parallel between the wealthy Romney and the Bruce Wayne character, a proverbial 1-percenter. In one trailer, Catwoman echoes the Occupy Wall Street movement, telling Wayne, \"There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches. Because when it hits, you're all going to wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.\"\n\nDixon too saw more parallels between Batman and Romney, telling a call-in radio show, \"Bane is a force for evil and the destruction of the status quo. He's far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street-type if you're looking to cast him politically. And if there ever was a Bruce Wayne running for the White House it would have to be Romney.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nLimbaugh suggested it\u2019s no accident that in a movie coming out four months before the presidential election, the villain bears the same name as the company formerly run by Romney and now being attacked by Democrats.\n\nIn politics, conspiracies are everywhere if you look hard enough. But Limbaugh\u2019s superpowers of persuasion can\u2019t make this theory stand up. The villainous Bane first appeared in Batman comic books in 1993, long before Romney entered presidential politics. Even the character\u2019s creator called a suggested link \"ridiculous.\" We rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10743"}
