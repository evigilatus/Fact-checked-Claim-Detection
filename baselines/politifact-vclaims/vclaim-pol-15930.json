See explanation at end.\n\n\nDuring an exchange with Sarah Palin in the St. Louis vice presidential debate on Oct. 2, 2008, Joe Biden tried to rebut a charge that Barack Obama had failed to \"fund the troops\" in Iraq by saying John McCain had done the same thing on a different bill.\n\n\nPalin began the exchange by saying that \"Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so. And Senator Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that. You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives. And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that. He turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops.\"\n\n\nBiden replied that Obama had offered a withdrawal plan that would shift responsibility to the Iraqis over the next 16 months and would draw down U.S. combat troops. As for the allegation about failing to fund the troops, Biden said, \"John McCain voted the exact same way. John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops. And John said I'm not going to fund the troops if in fact there's a timeline.\"\n\n\nRepublicans candidates have charged that Obama \"failed to fund the troops\" because of his May 24, 2007, vote against\n\nan appropriations bill\n\nthat included funding for the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. (It passed, 80-14.)\n\n\nWe addressed that charge in\n\nthis item\n\nand found it was misleading to say Obama did not want to fund the troops. We noted that Obama's primary reason was that the bill lacked a timetable for withdrawal. \u201cWe must fund our troops,\" he said at the time. \"But we owe them something more. We owe them a clear, prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war. ... We must negotiate a better plan that funds our troops, signals to the Iraqis that it is time for them to act and that begins to bring our brave servicemen and women home safely and responsibly.\u201d\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden's rebuttal in the vice presidential debate seems to be a reference to a war spending bill that first passed the Senate in March 2007. When Biden refers to an \"amendment,\" we believe he was referring to the provision that would require a withdrawal of troops. And Biden is correct that McCain voted against the bill when it included that requirement.\n\n\nThe bill,\n\nH.R. 1591\n\n, included $97 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and set a goal to withdraw most U.S. troops in Iraq by 2008. It passed 51-47 but was opposed by most Republicans because of its\u00a0timetable for withdrawal.\u00a0\n\n\nMcCain said he opposed the bill because it had been loaded with political pork and because it required a withdrawal\u00a0regardless of conditions in Iraq.\n\n\n\"Such a mandate would have grave consequences for the future of Iraq, the stability of the Middle East and the security of Americans at home and abroad.\u00a0 For these reasons, I do not support this bill,\" McCain said at the time. (The bill passed but was vetoed by President Bush.)\n\n\nBiden is right that\u00a0McCain\u00a0opposed\u00a0a war spending\u00a0bill. We find Biden's statement True.\n\n\nUPDATE: We originally rated Biden's statement Half True because, although McCain had issued a statement opposing the bill, he missed the vote on the bill on April 26, 2007. But after a reader called our attention to this vote, which occurred one month earlier, we changed our ruling to True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15930"}
