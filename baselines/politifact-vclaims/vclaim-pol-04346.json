David Young, a Republican in Iowa\u2019s 3rd District, which includes Des Moines and Council Bluffs. And this week, Mowrer is\u00a0up with\u00a0his first television ad\u00a0of the general election, highlighting his military record and history of service.\n\"True service is about putting others before yourself,\" the ad's narrator says over images of Mowrer in military\u00a0uniform. \"That is something Jim Mowrer has always done. After 9/11, Jim put us all first by serving for 23 months in Iraq, the war\u2019s longest tour.\"\nBut, according to military records obtained by The Des Moines Register through a Freedom of Information Act request, Mowrer served one year, three months and 18 days of foreign service in Iraq \u2014 or about 16 months.\nHis campaign insists the ad is not misleading because his unit was deployed for 23 months, which included more than six months of training in Mississippi before departing to Iraq.\n\"Anybody who's involved in the military or is a veteran doesn\u2019t parse between the time spent here training or in Iraq,\" said campaign manager Andrew Mulvey. \"It\u2019s all one deployment.\"\nCol. Greg Hapgood, director of public affairs for the Iowa National Guard, declined to comment about Mowrer or the ad specifically. But\u00a0he said there is a\u00a0distinction between a \"mobilization\" or a \"deployment,\" which includes\u00a0time when\u00a0soldiers are called up to active duty but may be training in the United States, and being \"in\u00a0country\" with boots on the ground in a foreign combat zone.\n\"I think from a technical sense, if an individual is going to talk about their service and to be honest about that service, you\u2019d need to differentiate between the total mobilization time and the time that was spent whether in training here in the U.S. or actually once you left the U.S. and went overseas into combat theater,\" he said.\n\"It is somewhat of a technicality, but if someone\u2019s going to be honest about their service, that\u2019s the correct way to characterize it.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMowrer enlisted in the National Guard in 2003 and served for six years. He was part of a unit that was mobilized and deployed in the fall of 2005 to fight terrorism in Iraq.\nAccording to a press release issued by the Iowa Army National Guard upon the unit\u2019s return, the Iowans were mobilized in September and October of 2005 and were sent to Camp Shelby in Mississippi. After additional training, they were deployed to Iraq in March and April of 2006.\nWhile in Iraq, Mowrer served as an intelligence analyst with the \"Ironman Battalion,\" which was tasked with convoy security on the western region of the Iraqi theater of operations.\nIn January 2007, the U.S. Department of Defense announced an extension of that deployment from 12 months in Iraq to 16 months as part of the military's \"surge.\"\nThe unit, which was in fact\u00a0the longest-deployed unit of the Iraq War according to a congressional resolution,\u00a0returned to Iowa in July and August of 2007, and Mowrer ended his service honorably\u00a0in 2009 without being redeployed.\u00a0He returned to Iraq as a civilian analyst and adviser to the commander of U.S. forces later that year.\nAccording to military records, Mowrer was mobilized from October 2005 through August 2007 \u2014 almost 23 months. According to his discharge papers, he served one year, three months and 18 days of foreign service, or about 16 months.\nOur ruling\nThe ad claims Mowrer served \"for 23 months in Iraq, the war\u2019s longest tour.\"\nIt\u2019s true that Mowrer\u2019s unit was deployed for 23 months, the longest continuous deployment of the Iraq War. But the ad says Mowrer \"served in Iraq for 23 months,\" which is not accurate. Mowrer served in Iraq for about 16 months. \u00a0\nBeing deployed,\u00a0which can include training in the United States, is different from\u00a0being \"in country,\" with boots on the ground of a foreign nation.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04346"}
