The Republic of Neta Louis, whose 17th legislature includes Rockland County and part of Westchester County, claims that the construction of a wall will not prevent the flow of opioids into the United States. \"I think there are serious differences about what we must do for border security,\" Louis, a democracy, told WNYC Radio host Brian Leherer. Louis, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, called the amount of opiates coming through ports of entry \"a real threat.\" People must know that opiates reached the United States through smugglers approaching legal entry points. \"The facts are, the majority of opiates and all kinds of other substances associated with opiates come from the point of entry,\" she said. \"They don't come with one person, maybe some. But they come in trucks, they come in cars, and they enter directly from the point of entry.\" She later added: \"The fence, the wall and the concrete wall that the President is talking about, from most of the experts, makes no difference.\" Given the debate over the construction of a wall along the southern border, as well as the lives lost due to opioid addiction, we wondered if Louie was right. Does most opiates come through legal ports of entry and not across borders where President Trump wants to build a wall? Background information on Trump, in support of his case for the wall, sometimes said that it would stop the flow of drugs. In budget note 2019, the Administration stated, \"The construction of the wall is crucial to hinder and prevent the flow of illicit drugs into our country.\" The south-west border \"remains the main entry point for heroin into the United States,\" according to the Drug Enforcement Agency. The United States has more than 300 ports of entry, with United States customs and border protection officers inspecting passengers and cargo. Enforcement in these ports of entry, such as airports and shipping facilities, is the responsibility of the Customs and Border Protection Field Operations Office. Enforcement between ports of entry is the responsibility of the Customs and Border Protection Authority Border Patrol. How opiates get here people inside and outside the government using United States customs and border protection data to understand how heroin and other drugs flow to the United States, but it should be noted that data reflect drug seizures and drugs that come without detection cannot be calculated. The Congressional Research Service warned in December that \"collection data are available, but reflect an unknown portion of the total drug trade in the United States. Limits.\" While we cannot measure heroin that comes into the country without detection, it should be noted that federal data since at least 2012 have been consistent in showing that agents encounter heroin at ports of entry much more than between ports of entry. Mike Burns, Louie's spokesman, referred to applied customs and border protection statistics in the United States to support her claim. The data show that the number of drugs detected at ports of entry far exceeds the number of drugs detected between ports of entry. The Field Operations Office, which operates at ports of entry, seized 4,813 pounds of heroin during the first 11 months of fiscal year 2018, until 31 August 2018. During the same period, the United States Border Patrol, which operates between legal ports of entry, seized 532 pounds of heroin. Statistics from the Customs and Border Protection Office from 2012 to 2017 show similar discrepancies between heroin seized at ports of entry and heroin seized between ports of entry. The data also show that Fentanyl, another opium, was seized at ports of entry at a higher rate than at points of entry between ports of entry. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021, the DEA reports similar results, and in its National Drug Threat Assessment 2018 states that \"a small percentage of all heroin seized by the Customs and Border Protection Office along the land border was between ports of entry.\" According to the Agency, most heroin flows to the country through privately owned vehicles entering legal ports of entry, followed by tractor trailers, where heroin is mixed with legal shipments. \"Puppets\" represent a lower proportion of heroin movement across the United States and Mexico border, according to the Agency. The Agency said that 85% of the Ventanyl that crossed the United States-Mexico border in 2017 entered through San Diego port of entry. The Congress Research Service, the Cato Institute and the Brookings Institution, among others, used data and analysis from drug law enforcement and customs agencies to explain the flow of drugs and recommend policy changes. David Beer, immigration analyst who writes about border security at the Liberal Cato Institute, said that by saying \"a majority\" of opiates came through ports of entry, Louie had \"the issue has been reduced.\" \"By weight, the middle port inspector seized 8 times more than cocaine, 17 times more than fentanyl, 23 times more than methamphetamine, and 36 times more than the average border guard control at the physical border in early 2018,\" wrote Pierre in an e-mail. \"Looking at these trends, a border wall or more border patrol personnel to stop drugs between ports of entry is meaningless.\" Bear wrote in a Kato paper. The Kato Institute advocates the legalization of drugs. A 2017 report by Fanda Philip-Brown, who led the Brookings Institution Project on World Drug Policy, used the same statistics and argued that the border wall would not affect the flow of drugs in the United States. Brookings is a policy think tank with colleagues from different perspectives. In early 2018, North Carolina &apos; s Polyte Fact verified the validity of a related claim from Anne Colter, where it linked \"100 per cent\" of the opioid epidemic to the absence of a wall and assessed it with \"pants on fire.\" In 2017, the Politifact National wrote about Tramp's allegations about how the border wall could prevent drugs from entering the country, and found that many of the illicit drugs coming into the United States came through legal ports of entry. Speaking of the partial closure of the federal government and Trump's desire to build a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico, Louie said that most opiates came from entry points, not between entry points where the wall was. Data from customs, border protection and analysis provided by the Drug Enforcement Agency confirm that when heroin and fentanyl come to the United States, most of them come through ports of entry of private vehicles, not between ports of entry. We're assessing Loey's claim right.
