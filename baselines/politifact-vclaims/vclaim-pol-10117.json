The seat is important for both parties and for control of the state Senate.\n\nThe ad focuses on what it calls Gudex\u2019s extreme views on abortion.\n\nBut miscarriages investigated by police?\n\nThat caught our attention.\n\nWhen asked for backup, Michelle McGrorty, executive director of the Greater Wisconsin fund, cited Gudex\u2019s endorsement by Pro-Life Wisconsin and a questionnaire candidates must answer before getting it.\n\nThe questionnaire includes this statement: \"Would you vote in favor of a state constitutional amendment that extends the inalienable right to life already found in the Wisconsin Constitution to all preborn children from conception?\"\n\nThat refers to what is called a \"personhood amendment.\" And Pro-Life Wisconsin says it endorses only candidates who answer \"yes\" to all questions on the survey.\n\nSuch an amendment was introduced in the state Assembly a year ago, but it was not acted on.\n\nHere\u2019s what Pro-Life says about that amendment:\n\n\"Put simply, a \u2018person\u2019 is a human being who is fully protected under the law; and we use the legal term \u2018personhood\u2019 to describe this condition. Once a human being is declared a person that individual is guaranteed certain legal rights, such as the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In other words, to be a person is to be fully protected by a series of God\u00ad given and constitutionally protected rights.\"\n\nMcGrorty argues such an amendment could lead to investigations of women who suffered a miscarriage.\n\n\"It basically extends the rights of a human being to a fertilized egg,\" she said. \"If someone had a miscarriage and if someone believed someone did something wrong, they could be investigated.\"\n\nBut here\u2019s where some trouble arises. The same argument could be used the other way: The language, at least in the 2011 bill, doesn\u2019t direct authorities to investigate miscarriages. It\u2019s silent on them. And it doesn\u2019t prevent authorities from enforcing other laws where pregnant women have engaged in drug abuse or other behavior that could injure or kill a fetus.\n\nWe called Gudex several times, but he didn\u2019t respond.\n\nHowever, since the ad started airing, he has responded in a couple of different ways.\n\n-- \"I would never advocate for what King and her friends are suggesting and voters of all persuasions should be outraged at the fabricated content of this ad,\" he told the Fond du Lac Reporter. He didn\u2019t say what part of the ad he considered \u00a0fabricated.\n\n-- Gudex told the Journal Sentinel that he does not support the personhood amendment \"in its current form.\" He said he does not support bans on birth control or investigations of miscarriages.\n\nMatt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin director of legislation, who wrote the endorsement survey, said the personhood question was not meant to tie a candidate to a specific bill. The information sheet referring to Joint Resolution 77 was meant to provide background information, Sande said.\n\n\"That\u2019s an example of what a personhood amendment is,\" Sande said. \"It was a generic question.\"\n\nThe group does not object to Gudex saying he would seek changes in the proposed amendment.\n\n\"That\u2019s fine with us,\" as long as he remains in favor of the idea of a personhood amendment, Sande said. \"He\u2019s certainly not backing off.\"\n\nOther states\n\nThe miscarriage argument against personhood amendments has been used elsewhere. For instance, under a bill in Georgia, women who miscarried could be found guilty of a felony, according to a Feb. 23, 2011 blog item in the liberal Mother Jones magazine.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia on March 2, 2011 rated the Mother Jones statement Mostly True. In that state, the lawmaker who wrote the bill said it was not his intention to have police investigate miscarriages. PolitiFact Georgia said the blogger\u2019s statement was correct but needed additional context, and noted that the bill\u2019s language \"is so broad it does open the door for women to face felony charges if they abuse drugs, fall off a bicycle, fail to wear a seat belt, or opt for cancer treatment while pregnant.\"\n\nThe item concluded: \"Women who miscarry might not be handled as felons. It depends on how prosecutors and judges decide to handle the law.\"\n\nA Nov. 7, 2011, Slate article about a proposed Mississippi personhood bill noted: \"A woman who suffers a miscarriage would be prosecuted not because she had a miscarriage, but because police and prosecutors suspect she might have had an abortion. You would certainly be investigated if your born child disappeared and you said it had died in an accident.\"\n\nSande said that common sense would ensure that women who suffered a miscarriage would not be investigated under a personhood amendment in Wisconsin.\n\n\"This gross exaggeration is being brought up in all of those states\" considering personhood bills, Sande said.\n\n\"A miscarriage is not intentional. It\u2019s a natural act, a natural occurrence,\" he said. \"The idea that she would be culpable -- it just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\"\n\nOur rating\n\nThe Greater Wisconsin Political Fund says in a television ad that legislation supported by a state Senate candidate could lead to police investigations of miscarriages. The claim stems from an endorsement from Pro-Life Wisconsin and relates to Gudex\u2019s support of all its positions, including supporting a \"personhood amendment.\"\n\nGudex has said he wants changes to the personhood amendment that was introduced in the last session, but hasn\u2019t said what alternative he would support.\n\nBut that language did not mandate investigation of miscarriages, as the ad suggests. The claim is based on an extrapolation of what could happen, but even the group\u2019s director said such an investigation would be because \"someone believed someone did something wrong,\" not simply because a miscarriage occurred.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10117"}
