Scott Walker keeps schedule secret", "text": "To fend off a recall effort aimed at removing him from office, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has traveled out of state to raise campaign money and been accused of being both greedy and secretive.\n\nDemocrat Kathleen Falk made such an attack on Feb. 18, 2012, 10 days after the Republican governor made a political trip to Florida.\n\nFalk, a former Dane County executive who has announced she will run against Walker in a recall election expected later in 2012, said at a candidates forum:\n\n\"My calendar will be public, unlike Scott Walker's. The only reason we know he's in Florida is because of Facebook. It's bad enough that he's out of state raising these unforeseen amounts of money from billionaires and millionaires instead of working here for us. But the fact that he's on our dime and we don't know where he is, is wrong. So, my record and my schedule will be public.\"\n\nLet\u2019s check both parts of Falk\u2019s claim -- that Walker doesn\u2019t make his schedule public and that \"he\u2019s on our dime and we don\u2019t know where he is.\"\n\nWalker\u2019s schedule\n\nWhen asked for evidence to back Falk\u2019s claim, Falk campaign spokesman Scot Ross said Walker does not post his schedule on a website or make it directly accessible to the public in any other way.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Walker does not post his schedule ahead of time. For some events, he gives advance notice to reporters. And under the state open records law, he also issues a monthly calendar -- after the fact -- to reporters and others who request it.\n\nThat calendar, which lists Walker\u2019s official activities as governor, is usually distributed about 10 days after the month ends, said Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie.\n\nThe two most recent monthly calendars available -- December 2011 and January 2012 -- list activities from morning until night, with a time frame listed for each. Included are activities such as public appearances, meetings, media interviews, travel and phone calls; some blocks of time are simply listed as personal.\n\nWerwie said calendars aren\u2019t released ahead of time because the governor\u2019s schedule can change by the hour.\n\nWalker\u2019s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, initially provided more information.\n\nDoyle released to reporters a weekly list of some of his upcoming public events, but stopped the practice near the end of his first term. During both of his terms, Doyle released a detailed monthly calendar after the fact. But, unlike Walker, he included events that, while not specified as political, could be easily ascertained as political events.\n\nFalk, who ran for governor and state attorney general while Dane County executive, issued a weekly notice listing highlights of some of her upcoming events as county executive, Ross said. Falk herself said: \"I didn't think it was the wisest thing to do to put campaign things on the county exec calendar regularly.\" So, in terms of excluding political events, Falk's list of upcoming events was similar to Walker's official calendar.\n\nMadison attorney Robert Dreps, an expert in media and political law, said governors are not compelled to create a schedule, but if they do, it is generally considered a public record that must be released upon request.\n\nSo, Falk is partially correct on the first part of her claim. Walker doesn\u2019t keep a public schedule that would enable citizens to know his plans ahead of time, but he does release his schedule after the fact.\n\n\u2018On our dime\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThe second part of Falk\u2019s claim -- that Walker is \"on our dime and we don\u2019t know where he is\" -- suggests that while he\u2019s working for the taxpayers, he takes political trips and doesn\u2019t give notice of them.\n\nFalk\u2019s campaign provided two Madison newspaper articles to support this part of the claim.\n\nThe Wisconsin State Journal reported in December 2011 that Walker \"has refused to keep the public informed as to his comings and goings. His presence in New York, or Texas or Washington has been learned after the fact and almost always tipped off by a blogger or a website listing.\" The Capital Times reported six weeks later that the \"governor's office does not send out press releases when he's headed out of town on campaign or personal business.\"\n\nWerwie, the governor\u2019s spokesman, confirmed that the governor\u2019s office does not publicize Walker\u2019s political events or include them in his official calendar, saying the office tries to draw a line between official and political events. He cited a state statute that prohibits political events from being planned, staffed or paid for by the governor\u2019s office.\n\nAttorney Dreps said it is arguable that political events would not have to be listed on calendars Walker releases, because Walker is not conducting official business, but that hasn\u2019t been tested in court.\n\nSo, Falk is partially correct on the second part of her claim, as well. It\u2019s true that Walker doesn\u2019t routinely notify the public about his political trips. But almost by definition he\u2019s not \"on the public dime\" if he\u2019s raising campaign money or involved in other political activity.\n\nOur rating\n\nFalk said Walker doesn't make his work schedule public -- \"he's on our dime and we don't know where he is.\"\n\nWalker makes his schedule public, but only after the fact. And while he typically doesn\u2019t give notice of his political activities, it\u2019s off base to claim he\u2019s on the public dime during those times.\n\nWe rate Falk\u2019s statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11470"}
