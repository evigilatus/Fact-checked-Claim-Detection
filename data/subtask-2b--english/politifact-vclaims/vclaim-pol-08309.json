Gov. Lincoln Chafee says his administration created 11,100 jobs since 2011", "text": "In his Jan. 15 State of the State address, Governor Lincoln Chafee noted that while the state\u2019s economy still has a way to go to recover from the collapse of 2008, economic indicators such as the unemployment rate and the number of people working had moved \"in the right direction.\"\nIt\u2019s easy to lose sight of the progress, he said, but the signs are there. He cited one statistic in particular.\n\"Since I took office in January 2011,\" he said, \"we have created 11,100 Rhode Island-based jobs.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nAt the time he gave his speech, the state\u2019s unemployment rate was 9 percent, tied with Nevada for worst in the nation. So we decided to check his numbers.\nThe 11,100 figure was derived from statistics compiled by the state Department of Labor and Training.\nDonna A. Murray, the department\u2019s assistant director of labor market information, said it came from subtracting the January 2011 Rhode Island jobs number - 459,500 - from the November 2013 number - 470,600.\nShe qualified it somewhat by noting that the November 2013 figure is an estimate that will be refined later this year when the state has a chance to review all Rhode Island employers\u2019 unemployment insurance filings.\nSo the jobs number was correct. How about the \"we created\" part?\nDetermining how much credit a political leader should get when jobs numbers go up -- or down -- can be tricky. Generally, they\u2019re influenced far more by national economic trends than anything a mayor or governor does.\nDuring the period Chafee cites, the national jobs number went from about 139.3 million to 143.2 million, a gain of around 2.8 percent, while Rhode Island\u2019s increase was about 2.4 percent.\nDid the number of jobs in the state increase because of efforts by the Chafee administration or because of the slow but steady improvements in the national economy?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we examined Cranston Mayor Allan Fung\u2019s claim that his administration created more than 1,000 jobs in the city, Fung provided a spreadsheet of 37 companies that had been directly helped by the city.\nWe checked with officials of some of those companies, who confirmed the city\u2019s help, leading us to rule Fung\u2019s claim Mostly True.\nWe asked the Chafee administration for such specific examples.\nSpokeswoman Faye Zuckerman didn\u2019t have a similar position-by-position count showing how the administration\u2019s help create specific jobs. Instead, she pointed to Chafee\u2019s Workforce Board, which spent about $10 million in 2013 on training and education programs on its own and in cooperation with hundreds of employers in the state.\nShe also noted Chafee\u2019s efforts to increase state aid to public schools, arguing that better-educated graduates would be better able to get jobs.\nThen we asked Edinaldo Tebaldi, assistant professor of economics at Bryant University, for guidance.\nInternal economic policies can have an effect on jobs, he said. But because Rhode Island\u2019s economy is relatively small compared with the rest of New England, it is more sensitive to regional and national trends.\nTebaldi said all politicians like to claim credit for job growth but it\u2019s hard to tell how much they drove it and how much was floated by a tide that was coming in anyway.\n\"It\u2019s really impossible to quantify,\" Tebaldi said. \"We know they have made a contribution, but we don\u2019t know how much.\"\nOur ruling\nGovernor Chafee said \"we have created 11,100 Rhode Island-based jobs\" since January 2011.\nThe number of jobs added in that period is correct. But the gains came at the same time the national economy was improving. The Chafee administration provided no direct evidence that its actions led to any of those jobs.\nBecause the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08309"}
