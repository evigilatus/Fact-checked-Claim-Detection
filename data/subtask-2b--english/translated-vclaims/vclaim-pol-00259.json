At a gathering in Manchester, N. H. Trump said his policies were decisive. \"In Pennsylvania we just opened a $10 billion factory,\" said Trump August 15. \"We have a lot of them coming up. A lot, a lot of jobs. In Louisiana, it was never possible to have a guaranteed natural gas plant (10 billion dollars). Pennsylvania would never have happened.\" Earlier this week, Trump was outside Pittsburgh to see a plastic factory nearly finished. The large facility will convert natural gas from cracking to polyethylene pellets. The plant, which was launched in 2012 and began in 2015, produced some 6,000 construction posts and is expected to reach 600 permanent posts. \"The Trump administration made it possible,\" said Trump, \"a sea of workers in the yellow and orange jackets of August 13. \"No one else. Without us, you couldn't have done this.\" Trump has already yelled about his role in getting and running Louisiana's plant. \"It's been so many years trying to get permits, they couldn't get permits,\" he said at the 16th meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers. \"But we got the permits, and we got them very quickly.\" The fact is that the LNG plant in Louisiana and the plant in Pennsylvania were in business during Obama's years. At the Louisiana plant, there is a Cameron natural gas project with three plants that cool natural gas until it becomes liquid that is shipped all over the world. It can afford 1.7 billion cubic feet per day with its capacity. According to the company's website, \"In April 2014, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the final environmental impact statement for the construction and operation of the liquefied facility. The project was authorized by the Emergency and Security Authority in June 2014.\" The company obtained its first federal approval in 2012. In 2016, Washington gave permission to add two more lines of fluid, although the company did not decide to move forward on those lines. While the exports of the Liberian National Government rose dramatically under Trump, making the station more profitable, actual plans and licences came long before it took office. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to launch security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, the Pennsylvania factory in 2012 selected an old industrial site in West Pennsylvania for a major petrochemical facility. Chill Chemical Appalacia purchased the drug in 2014 and started pre-construction work in early 2015. Shel made the final decision to build the plant in June 2016. The project needs two basic permits to protect air and water quality, but they are state-level decisions. By mid-2015, the Environmental Protection Department of Pennsylvania had been granted initial permits for both. Final approvals had been issued by mid-2018. Washington played a role in a pipeline to deliver natural gas to the factory. While the State approved the construction in 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was forced to sign the prices that the company would charge to pipeline users. It issued its approval in September 2018. However, the Commission noted in its order that the company's proposal was \"not opposed.\" While both projects are swinging, the use of tariffs by Trump has not been entirely affected. The demand for exports of low natural gas remains high, but the Trump trade war with China has reduced shipments to that country. In 2017, China was the third largest buyer. In 2018, China responded to United States customs tariffs at 10 per cent duty on the Liberian National Government. In May 2019, Reuters reported that only two vessels had left for China since January, compared to 14 in the first four months of 2018. The steel trump tariffs threatened to make progress at the petrochemical complex in Pennsylvania. In the face of quotas limiting steel imports, Shel warned in 2018 that it would need to slow down construction and could release hundreds of workers. Mr. Pat Tommy, R-Ba Company, sent a letter to the Administration on 23 August 2018 requesting relief. The Department has done so within a week. Our Governor Trump said that two major industrial projects in Louisiana and Pennsylvania are today thanks to his policies. In fact, both were moving forward before he took office. By 2014, the Louisiana plant had all the necessary federal permits. The Pennsylvania Chemical Complex was regulated by the State and the initial approvals came in 2015. The federal organizers approved the price structure of a main pipeline in 2018, but the construction of the pipeline itself was approved by the state, not by the federal government. Trump can take credit for promoting low natural gas exports and driving a regulatory approach to natural gas, but these dynamics existed before he was elected.
