Gov. Donald Carsery wasn't campaigning with me.", "text": "The 38 studio loan that was mislodged took the largest period of time during the debate on 21 October between the three candidates for the position of Governor of Rhode Island, and part of the focus was Donald Karsiri, the former Republican Governor who sponsored the transaction. Democratic Jenna Raimundo and the Republican Alan Fong spoke out against those who fought heavily against the loan. Raimundo said she resisted the deal from the beginning, but Fong, who was the mayor of Cranston at the time, said, \"He was silent.\" Then I went one step further. \"In fact,\" said Raimundo, \"A week ago, it was a campaign with Governor Carcieri, this engineer.\" Fong responded a few minutes later: \"Governor Karsiri wasn't campaigning with me, so this is wrong.\" It would be surprising if the two of them had undertaken a joint campaign because Carsiri, who had widely criticized his role in the 38 studio deal, remained out of sight. Because Fong had the last word in the exchange, we decided to assess his denial. We were also motivated by the publication of \"fact-finding\" news by the spokesman for the Rhode Island Democratic Party Peter Baptista, who allegedly proves that Fong lied. According to the news release, Karsiri attended a Fong fundraiser attended by Mitt Romney and indicated that Karsiri was a member of the Fong State exploratory committee. We know it may be hard to prove that nothing happened, but here are the facts. Karsiri attended the fund-raising ceremony on 16 October for the Fong, which included Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate, who served as Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2006. Facebook published on January 23, 2021 in social media \"Baiden invested the entire family's wealth in Ukrainian gas and oil. Then closes the Keystone pipeline. But most people will define the campaign with someone as going out or about to go out with the candidate, meet people, shake hands, try to convince them to vote for the candidate and/or give money. Service in an exploratory committee or attendance at fund-raising as a witness does not constitute a campaign with a candidate, at least not in the way Raimundo made the sound. The spokesman for Fong Robert Cobb said: \"Governor Karsiri contributed to the campaign and attended lunch with Governor Romney last week. He didn't have a role in the campaign. Before Mayor Fong announced, Governor Karsiri was a member of the exploratory committee.\" We also contacted Carcier directly. \"My wife and I contributed to Alan and supported him, but that's all. The former Governor said I didn't campaign with him. \"I know what an electoral campaign is. I've done enough of it.\" Carcerie said he went to the event to see Romney because me and Matt were back to the first time we had come to office together, and we worked very closely together as New England governors. I've been a great supporter of both his presidency, and I haven't seen him or talked to him in a while, so it was a chance to catch up and visit a little bit, which we did.\" We asked the Raimundo campaign if they had any better evidence that, for example, Karsiri addressed the crowd at the fund-raising event. The woman speaking Nicole Kainer produced a picture taken outside Providence Biltmore of Carseri, citing a report in the newspaper Providence Journal: \"By the closed doors of the dance hall, the cheers were followed by the name Fong and the name of the last Republican Governor of the state, Donald Karsiri.\" However, this is very poor evidence of a stuffed claim. In short, we found no convincing evidence that the previous Government. Donald Carsery is campaigning with Alan Fong. In order to do that, we're assessing the Fong statement right.
