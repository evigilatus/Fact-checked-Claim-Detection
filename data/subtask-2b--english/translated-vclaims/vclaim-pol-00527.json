Johnson, right in relation to the claim for the crossing of the southern border", "text": ":: Editor &apos; s note: This element was originally published with the classification of Tuly mostly, based on a copy provided by CBS. After Ron Johnson's crew objected to that version, we heard the sound several times and felt that the way his office wrote the interview was correct. This changes this estimate to correct. For President Donald Tramp, the number of illegal border crossings on the southern border has become so large that he has declared the situation a national emergency. But how many traffic flows from Mexico to the United States? According to Ron Johnson from the U.S., R-Weiss, about 23,000 families a week cross the border illegally. Following a recent trip to the southern border, he commented that Congress should give priority to actions aimed at cutting off border crossings rather than investigating Trump. \"Only the last three weeks, on average, about 23,000 women, children, men who come illegally across the border as family units or as unaccompanied children,\" Johnson, Chairman of the Internal Security Committee, 26 May 2019 in CBS, said \"the face of the nation.\" He then referred to \"22,000 to 23,000 a week,\" slightly adjusted the number. This is a lot of illegal crossings. We decided to look at the numbers. The numbers of Republicans repeatedly point to a border crisis on the southern edge of the country, and the United States customs and border protection data are already showing a dramatic shift in recent months. The Border Patrol reported the arrest of 440,000 people at the south-west border until May 2019, which is approximately equivalent to the arrest of 467,000 in 2018 in its entirety. The number of arrests per month increased from 48,000 in January to more than 90,000 in March and April and 133,000 in May. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, these accounts include three different categories of migrants followed by border patrols - family units (i.e. a person arrested with a family member), unaccompanied children and single adults. The totals do not include immigrants who are expelled upon asylum or other forms of legal admission in the United States. When we contacted Johnson's office, his spokesman, Ben Foyle, said that Johnson's reference to 23,000 crossings came from border patrol arrest data. The Johnson office took the number of arrests in May involving family units and unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras and divided by four. \"The face of the nation\" quoted Johnson as referring to unaccompanied children in a separate sentence:...\" about 23,000 women, children, men who come illegally across the border as family units. There are unaccompanied children.\" This makes it less clear whether Johnson included children in the 23000 census. However, a newsletter from the Johnson office used the phrase \"or as unaccompanied children.\" Notwithstanding this, the Johnson Statement referred to illegal transit operations in general, not from specific countries. Therefore, we will use these criteria to verify his calculations. In May, the Border Patrol reported 96,049 arrests of migrants from family units or unaccompanied children at the southern border. :: Transferred to a weekly average (4.43 weeks in 31 days), i.e. 21,681 persons per week from a family unit. If we look at all the migrants arrested in May at the southern border - families, adults and unaccompanied children - the weekly average is about 30,000 people. This is more than three times the rate it was a year ago. In May 2018, an average of 9,000 migrants were arrested per week on the southern border. Our rule, Johnson, said about 23,000 people a week illegally cross the southern border as family units or as unaccompanied children. The data used to arrive at this figure do not exactly correspond to the way Johnson described it, so the actual number was slightly less than 22,000 a week in May. So it's very close. If we look at all the concerns on the southern border, the number is much more than Johnson mentioned. His general point about the increasing number of arrests at the border is true. We're assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00527"}
