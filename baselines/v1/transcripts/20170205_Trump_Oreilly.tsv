0001	Bill O'Reilly	Caution, you are about to enter the No Spin Zone, THE FACTOR begins right now.
0002	Bill O'Reilly	Hi, I am Bill O'Reilly.
0003	Bill O'Reilly	Thanks for watching us tonight.
0004	Bill O'Reilly	As you may know, my interview with President Trump making headlines all over the world.
0005	Bill O'Reilly	And tonight, we will show you what you did not see in the Super Bowl pregame show.
0006	Bill O'Reilly	Here is what happened.
0007	Bill O'Reilly	We interviewed the President on Friday afternoon, at the White House.
0008	Bill O'Reilly	The interview ran about 40 minutes.
0009	Bill O'Reilly	Ten of which were used by FOX Sports.
0010	Bill O'Reilly	So, that leaves us with half an hour.
0011	Bill O'Reilly	To show you tonight and tomorrow.
0012	Bill O'Reilly	The headlines out of the Super Bowl interview where Mr. Trump comments on the Russian and Putin and the antiObamaCare rollup.
0013	Bill O'Reilly	It's interesting to watch our two competing cable news stations, which hate, hate Mr. Trump to an unhealthy degree.
0014	Bill O'Reilly	Try to analyze what the President told me.
0015	Bill O'Reilly	I thought Donald Trump was straightforward and honest in that interview, whether you like his answers or not.
0016	Bill O'Reilly	But the Trump haters were trying desperately to find something with which to hammer the President.
0017	Bill O'Reilly	Also apparently the Putin administration in Moscow demanding that I, your humble correspondent, apologized for saying old blood is a killer.
0018	Bill O'Reilly	So, I am working on that apology, but it may take a little time.
0019	Bill O'Reilly	Might want to check in with me around 2023.
0020	Bill O'Reilly	In a conference call with reporters, Putin's press guy said this.
0021	SYSTEM	[Begin Video Clip]
0022	SYSTEM	[Via Translator]
0023	Bill O'Reilly	We think words like that coming from the FOX correspondent are unacceptable, offensive, and to be honest, we would prefer to get an apology to the President coming from such a respected company.
0024	SYSTEM	[End Video Clip]
0025	Bill O'Reilly	Anyway, tonight, we have a number of subjects that we presented to President Trump.
0026	Bill O'Reilly	Here they are.
0027	SYSTEM	[Begin Video Clip]
0028	Bill O'Reilly	Let's talk about Iran, your assessment, do you think we are on a collision course we being the United States with that country?
0029	Donald Trump	I think it was the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated.
0030	Donald Trump	I think it was deal that should have never been negotiated.
0031	Bill O'Reilly	The nuclear deal?
0032	Donald Trump	Absolutely.
0033	Donald Trump	The deal that was made by the Obama administration, I think it's a shame that we've had a deal like that and that we had to sign a deal like that and there was no reason to do it.
0034	Donald Trump	And if you're going to do it have a good deal.
0035	Donald Trump	Secretary Kerry who was negotiating it never once left the table.
0036	Donald Trump	We have the worst of everything.
0037	Donald Trump	We've already given them billions and billions, probably hundred $50 billion.
0038	Donald Trump	We gave them $1.7 billion in cash, which is unheard of.
0039	Donald Trump	And we put the money out.
0040	Donald Trump	And we have really nothing to show for it.
0041	Bill O'Reilly	Possibly you'll tear it up?
0042	Donald Trump	We will see what happens.
0043	Donald Trump	And we'll going to see what happens.
0044	Donald Trump	I can say this, they had total disregard for our country.
0045	Donald Trump	They are the number one terrorist state, they're sending money all over the place and weapons, and can't do that.
0046	Bill O'Reilly	Sanctions, that's how you're going to start with them?
0047	Donald Trump	Just started.
0048	Bill O'Reilly	But you're going to move in a carrier, right?
0049	Donald Trump	Well, we're just started with sanctions.
0050	Donald Trump	I never talked about military moves.
0051	Donald Trump	I always criticize President Obama with having an announcement that they're going into Mosul, they're going to some place.
0052	Donald Trump	And they give the name, the date, the time.
0053	Donald Trump	I don't believe in that.
0054	Donald Trump	We will  let's see what happens.
0055	Donald Trump	But I don't like to talk about what we do militarily.
0056	Bill O'Reilly	So, you're not real bullish on Iran at this point.
0057	Donald Trump	No, I'm not bullish.
0058	Donald Trump	It's like they're emboldened.
0059	Donald Trump	They follow our planes, they circle our ships with their little boats, and they scream things at us.
0060	Donald Trump	It is what happened  it's not good.
0061	Donald Trump	You would thought what the deal they made, which was a great deal for them and a horrible deal for us, that they would have had a warmth toward our country, and it's exactly the opposite.
0062	Donald Trump	They lost respect because they can't believe anybody could be so stupid as to make a deal like that.
0063	Bill O'Reilly	Let's talk about Mexico.
0064	Bill O'Reilly	There was a report that you talk to President Nieto, and you told him that this was the report.
0065	Bill O'Reilly	I want to know if it's true or not.
0066	Bill O'Reilly	That if his arm he couldn't handle the drug cartels, that U.S. army soldiers would.
0067	Bill O'Reilly	Did you say that?
0068	Donald Trump	We have to do something about the cartels, I did talk to him about it.
0069	Donald Trump	I want to help him with it.
0070	Donald Trump	I think he is a very good man.
0071	Donald Trump	We have a very good relationship, as you probably know.
0072	Donald Trump	We will going to have a wall, we will going to have a border.
0073	Donald Trump	We have to stop drugs from coming into our country, and if he can handle it, and maybe they can and maybe they can't or maybe he needs help, he seemed very willing to get help from us because he has got a problem and it's a real problem for us.
0074	Bill O'Reilly	So, President Nieto of Mexico was open to the possibility of U.S. forces, all right?
0075	Bill O'Reilly	Helping him combat the drug cartels.
0076	Donald Trump	I would rather, as a very nice man that he is and somebody I respect, I would rather have him respond to that.
0077	Donald Trump	But I will tell you, I certainly offered him help on knocking out the drug cartels because we have got a problem.
0078	Donald Trump	Don't forget those cartels are operating in our country, and they are poisoning the youth of our country.
0079	Donald Trump	And by the way, countries all over the work, just so you understand, this is a cartel all over the world, the cartels.
0080	Donald Trump	But I certainly would help him if he needed the help here
0081	Bill O'Reilly	At this point, do you consider Mexico a corrupt country?
0082	Bill O'Reilly	Because this stuff has been going on for decades.
0083	Bill O'Reilly	His Mexico corrupt.
0084	Donald Trump	Well, it's a country that has got difficulty.
0085	Donald Trump	It's certainly has done well with us.
0086	Donald Trump	We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $60 billion a year.
0087	Donald Trump	That doesn't include drugs, and it doesn't include the border and all the things that are happening on the border.
0088	Donald Trump	But it is a country that I have great respect for the people.
0089	Donald Trump	I love the people.
0090	Donald Trump	I really like this administration.
0091	Donald Trump	I think he is a good man.
0092	Donald Trump	We get along very well.
0093	Donald Trump	But they have problems controlling aspects of their country.
0094	Donald Trump	There is no question about it.
0095	Donald Trump	And I would say that drugs and the drug cartels number one.
0096	Bill O'Reilly	Have you figured out what kind of a tariff you're going to levy on Mexico to pay for the wall?
0097	Donald Trump	Well, we might not have to do that.
0098	Donald Trump	They want to negotiate a deal.
0099	Donald Trump	I want to negotiate a deal.
0100	Donald Trump	We will see what happens.
0101	Donald Trump	But we can always do a tariff or a tax if necessary, and we will do that if necessary.
0102	Donald Trump	But if we can make a deal, we assignment of NAFTA, but I am going to put another F in the name NAFTA because right now it's free trade, and I'm going to have it fair trade also because it's not fair.
0103	Bill O'Reilly	All right.
0104	Bill O'Reilly	So 
0105	Donald Trump	We are losing, Bill.
0106	Donald Trump	We are losing $60 billion a year in trade deficits with Mexico.
0107	Donald Trump	We can't do that.
0108	Bill O'Reilly	You talked to Putin last week.
0109	Bill O'Reilly	You had a busy week last week.
0110	Donald Trump	I had a busy week.
0111	Donald Trump	Yes.
0112	Donald Trump	Busy week and a half.
0113	Bill O'Reilly	But within 24 hours of you on the phone with the Russian leader, the proRussian forces step up the violence in Ukraine.
0114	Donald Trump	Yes.
0115	Bill O'Reilly	Did you take that as an insult?
0116	Donald Trump	No I didn't because we don't really know exactly what that is.
0117	Donald Trump	They're proforces.
0118	Donald Trump	We don't know if they're uncontrollable?
0119	Donald Trump	Are they uncontrollable?
0120	Donald Trump	That happens also.
0121	Donald Trump	We're going to find out.
0122	Donald Trump	I will be surprised, but we will see.
0123	Bill O'Reilly	Do you respect Putin?
0124	Donald Trump	I do respect him.
0125	Bill O'Reilly	Do you?
0126	Bill O'Reilly	Why?
0127	Donald Trump	Well, I respect a lot of people.
0128	Donald Trump	But that doesn't mean I am going to get along with him.
0129	Donald Trump	He's a leader of his country.
0130	Donald Trump	I say it's better to get along with Russia than not.
0131	Donald Trump	Will I get along with them?
0132	Donald Trump	I have no idea.
0133	Bill O'Reilly	He is a killer though.
0134	Bill O'Reilly	Put is a killer.
0135	Donald Trump	There are a lot of killers.
0136	Donald Trump	Do you think our country is so innocent?
0137	Donald Trump	Do you think our country is so innocent?
0138	Bill O'Reilly	I don't know of any government leaders that are killers in America.
0139	Donald Trump	Take a look at what we have done too.
0140	Donald Trump	We've made a lot of mistakes.
0141	Donald Trump	I've been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.
0142	Bill O'Reilly	Yes.
0143	Bill O'Reilly	Mistakes are different then 
0144	Donald Trump	A lot of mistakes, okay?
0145	Donald Trump	But a lot of people were killed.
0146	Donald Trump	So, a lot of killers around, believe me.
0147	Bill O'Reilly	All right.
0148	Bill O'Reilly	You mentioned ISIS.
0149	Bill O'Reilly	Can we expect, we the American people, more U.S. military action against ISIS?
0150	Donald Trump	You know, I hate to be evasive but 
0151	Bill O'Reilly	You know, tell me specifically.
0152	Donald Trump	I don't like talking openly about it.
0153	Donald Trump	I don't like talking openly about it.
0154	Donald Trump	I can say this, ISIS is bad.
0155	Donald Trump	They are evil.
0156	Donald Trump	They cut off heads of Christians and Muslims and anybody else that gets in their way.
0157	Donald Trump	They drown people in steel cages.
0158	Donald Trump	This is like not since the medieval times has anything happened like this.
0159	Donald Trump	And the previous administration allowed it to happen because we shouldn't have been in Iraq, but we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.
0160	Donald Trump	It created a vacuum, ISIS was formed.
0161	Donald Trump	I was to take the oil.
0162	Donald Trump	If they would've taken the oil, there would be no ISIS because they used that to 
0163	Bill O'Reilly	If you took the oil, the Iraqi oil, you would have to put in U.S. troops to do that, and then that would have started another round of it.
0164	Donald Trump	And you would have made a lot of money with the oil and you would have had assets and to the  and all of that.
0165	Donald Trump	But forget that.
0166	Bill O'Reilly	Okay.
0167	Bill O'Reilly	Let's turn to domestic policy.
0168	Bill O'Reilly	When can Americans expect the tax cuts?
0169	Bill O'Reilly	This year?
0170	Donald Trump	Yes.
0171	Donald Trump	We are working very much right now on the health care package.
0172	Donald Trump	Which I think would be  it is moving along very well.
0173	Donald Trump	We are trying to get our person Dr. Tom price approved, as you know, the Democrats are being purely political reasons.
0174	Bill O'Reilly	Yes.
0175	Donald Trump	That is terrible.
0176	Bill O'Reilly	But let me get you on the record here.
0177	Bill O'Reilly	2017, can Americans expect a tax cut?
0178	Donald Trump	I think so, yes.
0179	Donald Trump	And I think before the end of the year, I would like to say yes.
0180	Bill O'Reilly	Okay.
0181	Bill O'Reilly	Can Americans in 2017 expect a new health care plan ruled out by the Trump administration?
0182	Bill O'Reilly	This year.
0183	Donald Trump	Well, in the process, and maybe it will take until sometime into next year, but we are certainly going to be in the process.
0184	Donald Trump	Very complicated.
0185	Donald Trump	ObamaCare is a disaster.
0186	Donald Trump	You have to remember, ObamaCare doesn't work.
0187	Donald Trump	You look at Arizona, 160 percent increase.
0188	Donald Trump	You look at Minnesota, all of these places it's going through the roof.
0189	Bill O'Reilly	It's done.
0190	Donald Trump	It doesn't work.
0191	Bill O'Reilly	But when are you going to have something ready?
0192	Donald Trump	We're going to be putting it in very soon.
0193	Donald Trump	I think that yes, I would like to say by the end of the year.
0194	Donald Trump	At least the rudiments, but we should have something within a year into the following year.
0195	Donald Trump	And by the way, we will have something that is good.
0196	Donald Trump	Less expensive and really great health care.

0202	Bill O'Reilly	Continuing now with our lead story, an interview with President Trump at the White House last Friday.
0203	Bill O'Reilly	As stated the talk is making headlines all over the world.
0204	Bill O'Reilly	Here is part two.
0205	SYSTEM	[Begin Video Clip]
0206	Bill O'Reilly	Now, this is a fascinating story.
0207	Bill O'Reilly	I just spent the week in California, as you know.
0208	Bill O'Reilly	They are now voting on whether they should become a sanctuary state.
0209	Bill O'Reilly	So, the state of California, led by Governor Jerry Brown is defying you, absolutely defying the President of the United States.
0210	Bill O'Reilly	So, California and the USA are on a collision course.
0211	Bill O'Reilly	How do you see it?
0212	Donald Trump	Well, I think it is a ridiculous sanctuary cities as you know.
0213	Donald Trump	I am very much opposed to sanctuary cities.
0214	Donald Trump	They break crime, there are lots of problems.
0215	Donald Trump	You do it very well with Kate and all of the other people you talk about on the show that I watch.
0216	Donald Trump	I will tell you that sanctuary cities are  they got a lot of problems, and if there is tremendous crime.
0217	Donald Trump	A lot of people agree with me.
0218	Donald Trump	This was a campaign issue.
0219	Donald Trump	This isn't just brought up now.
0220	Donald Trump	California in many ways is out of control, as you know.
0221	Donald Trump	And from an economic standpoint, people are leaving California and going to Texas and other places that run in a different manner, but we will see what happens.
0222	Donald Trump	We will certainly not stand for sanctuary even cities, let alone states.
0223	Bill O'Reilly	You mentioned Kate's Law.
0224	Bill O'Reilly	Why do you think the Democratic Party opposes Kate's Law?
0225	Bill O'Reilly	It seems so logical.
0226	Donald Trump	Yes.
0227	Donald Trump	It's so logical.
0228	Donald Trump	There are many things that are very logical, the tax cuts are logical but the Democrats who want to raise taxes 
0229	Bill O'Reilly	But you didn't answer my question.
0230	Bill O'Reilly	Why do the Democrats oppose, oppose, protecting Americans from violent foreign criminals?
0231	Bill O'Reilly	Why?
0232	Donald Trump	Because they think that is their voter.
0233	Bill O'Reilly	You know what is fascinating, to watch you at the inauguration with Barack Obama.
0234	Bill O'Reilly	You guys seem to get along.
0235	Bill O'Reilly	All right?
0236	Bill O'Reilly	Would that be accurate?
0237	Donald Trump	It's a very strange phenomenon.
0238	Donald Trump	We get along.
0239	Donald Trump	I don't know if he will admit this, but he likes me.
0240	Bill O'Reilly	How do you know he likes you?
0241	Donald Trump	I like him because I can feel it.
0242	Donald Trump	You know, that is what I do in life, it's called like, I understand.
0243	Donald Trump	Now, we had a rough campaign.
0244	Donald Trump	He was fighting better for Hillary than she did.
0245	Donald Trump	He was vicious during the campaign toward me, and I was vicious toward him.
0246	Donald Trump	We said horrible things about each other.
0247	Donald Trump	And then we hopped into the car and we drive down Pennsylvania Avenue together.
0248	Donald Trump	We don't even talk about it.
0249	Donald Trump	Politics is amazing.
0250	Bill O'Reilly	What did you talk about?
0251	Donald Trump	We talked about the country.
0252	Donald Trump	We talked about the future of the country.
0253	Donald Trump	I asked him about what you think our biggest problem is, and he told me that I can't tell you, but it's a problem.
0254	Donald Trump	It's a military problem.
0255	Bill O'Reilly	China?
0256	Donald Trump	No, it's not China.
0257	Bill O'Reilly	No?
0258	Donald Trump	No, it is, he did mention  because I did ask him, I said, what would you say one, two, three problems are?
0259	Donald Trump	And the number one problem that he felt I was a little bit surprised but I fully understand 
0260	Bill O'Reilly	But you can't tell us?
0261	Donald Trump	I can't do that.
0262	Donald Trump	I can't do that.
0263	Donald Trump	Not for any other reason other than I don't think he would mind if I said it.
0264	Donald Trump	I don't want to let that particular place know that that's the way he or I feel.
0265	Donald Trump	But we had a great  it was a great inauguration.
0266	Donald Trump	I loved every minute of it, and I got along with him.
0267	Donald Trump	In fact, people were sort of surprised.
0268	Donald Trump	I finished, I turned around, he was smiling, I was smiling.
0269	Bill O'Reilly	It was fascinating.
0270	Bill O'Reilly	But here's what was more fascinating.
0271	Bill O'Reilly	Right after you guys embraced, shook hands, all of that, you gave a speech.
0272	Bill O'Reilly	But your speech excoriated him.
0273	Bill O'Reilly	You basically took his administration apart, and he is sitting five feet away from you.
0274	Bill O'Reilly	In your mind, did you say, how is he reacting to this speech?
0275	Donald Trump	See, I am an honest person, the country has a very, very deep seated problems.
0276	Donald Trump	We have to do something about it.
0277	Donald Trump	And if you noticed, when I finish my speech, I turned around, shook his hand 
0278	Bill O'Reilly	Yes.
0279	Bill O'Reilly	Absolutely.
0280	Donald Trump	And he was very gracious.
0281	Donald Trump	And smiling.
0282	Bill O'Reilly	I don't know if he was happy with that.
0283	Donald Trump	I don't know, but he seemed to be.
0284	Donald Trump	But this isn't just a knock on him.
0285	Donald Trump	We have been going down the wrong path for many years beyond him.

0287	Bill O'Reilly	Now, tomorrow, I asked the President some personal questions about his White House experience so far.
0288	Bill O'Reilly	I think you will find it interesting.

0290	SYSTEM	[Begin Part 3]
0291	Bill O'Reilly	What is the most surprising thing for you about this job you have?
0292	Bill O'Reilly	You come from the private sector, no political office, now, you are the President of United States.
0293	Bill O'Reilly	What surprised you?
0294	Donald Trump	I think the size, the magnitude of everything.
0295	Donald Trump	So, I was a very big real estate person.
0296	Donald Trump	I build a building for 500 million or $900 million.
0297	Donald Trump	And here, you look at an airplane contract where you can save $600 million on 90 plans.
0298	Donald Trump	I saved more than $600 million.
0299	Donald Trump	I got involved in negotiation on a fighter jet, the F35.
0300	Donald Trump	And by the way, Lockheed Martin, a great company.
0301	Donald Trump	But they weren't bringing their price up.
0302	Donald Trump	I got involved, I saved more than $600 million.
0303	Donald Trump	I was very proud of that.
0304	Donald Trump	But the magnitude of  you can do that at every level of government.
0305	Donald Trump	My new thing is going to be Pharma because we pay too much with the largest drug purchaser in the world.
0306	Donald Trump	And they don't negotiate.
0307	Bill O'Reilly	How many hours a day you're working?
0308	Donald Trump	I'm working long hours.
0309	Donald Trump	Long hours.
0310	Donald Trump	Right up until 1200, 100 in the morning.
0311	Bill O'Reilly	What time do you get up?
0312	Donald Trump	Five o'clock.
0313	Bill O'Reilly	All right.
0314	Bill O'Reilly	And you are working after you have breakfast?
0315	Donald Trump	I read the papers, I see what is going on, I take a look.
0316	Donald Trump	I see the lies, you know, the lies  that is another thing.
0317	Donald Trump	I always got good press.
0318	Donald Trump	You know, I was a business guy, I got good press.
0319	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0320	Donald Trump	I know.
0321	Donald Trump	I have never  I collect, you know, fake news.
0322	Donald Trump	Some of the networks and some of the papers  the level of dishonesty, when they take a story that should be good, I know good from bad.
0323	Bill O'Reilly	Sure.
0324	Donald Trump	They take something that should be a good story, in fact, sometimes, I say, oh, this is going to be nice to read and say, whoa.
0325	Donald Trump	And they will purposely totally change it.
0326	Donald Trump	It is fake news.
0327	Bill O'Reilly	Why are they doing that?
0328	Donald Trump	Well, because I am on the other side of the equation.
0329	Donald Trump	They did it to Reagan but not as much.
0330	Bill O'Reilly	Why?
0331	Bill O'Reilly	I don't understand.
0332	Donald Trump	I just think that it is just the other side of the coin.
0333	Donald Trump	You know, they called themselves progressive, which is a beautiful word.
0334	Donald Trump	But it's not true.
0335	Bill O'Reilly	Do you think they don't like you?
0336	Donald Trump	When you look at what happens  I don't know.
0337	Donald Trump	I think they don't like my  I don't think they like anybody on our side.
0338	Bill O'Reilly	I know you for a long time and I know that, you know, when people attack you personally, that bothers you.
0339	Bill O'Reilly	So, they are saying that you are antiMuslim.
0340	Bill O'Reilly	They are saying you are antiBlack.
0341	Bill O'Reilly	They are saying you are antipoor.
0342	Bill O'Reilly	Do you respond, because you do come back?
0343	Donald Trump	I always respond.
0344	Bill O'Reilly	I mean, but does it hurt your feelings that they are making you into a hater?
0345	Donald Trump	No because they always do it.
0346	Donald Trump	The first thing they do with the Republicans or conservatives is the racist card.
0347	Donald Trump	They pull out the racist card.
0348	Donald Trump	They always do.
0349	Donald Trump	Not just me.
0350	Donald Trump	I mean, they do it with everybody.
0351	Donald Trump	And I see that and once you know that, you feel a lot better about it.
0352	Bill O'Reilly	Is there any validity to the criticism of you that you say things you can't back up factually?
0353	Bill O'Reilly	And as the President  you can do that as a candidate or businessman.
0354	Bill O'Reilly	But if you say for example that there are three million illegal aliens who voted and then, you don't have the data to back it up, some people is going to say, that is irresponsible for a president to say that.
0355	Bill O'Reilly	Is there any validity?
0356	Donald Trump	Well, many people have come out and said I am right.
0357	Donald Trump	You know that.
0358	Bill O'Reilly	I know but you have to have the data to back that up.
0359	Donald Trump	And doesn't have to do with a vote, although, that is the end result, it has to do with the registration.
0360	Donald Trump	And when you look at the registration, and you see dead people that have voted, that are on many, many dead people are on that have voted, when you see people that are registered in two states that voted in two states, when you see other things, when you see illegals, people that are not citizens, and they are on the registration rolls.
0361	Donald Trump	See?
0362	Donald Trump	What they do is they load up the registration rolls.
0363	Donald Trump	There is a lot of bad things happening.
0364	Donald Trump	Look, Bill, we can be babies but you take a look at the registration, you have illegals, you have dead people, you have this, it is really a bad situation.
0365	Donald Trump	It is really bad.
0366	Bill O'Reilly	So, you think you're going to be proven correct in that statement?
0367	Donald Trump	Well, I think I already have.
0368	Donald Trump	A lot of people have come out and said that I am right.
0369	Bill O'Reilly	Yes.
0370	Bill O'Reilly	But the data has to show that three million illegals voted.
0371	Donald Trump	Look, we have a lot of different  you go to the voting booths and you see what was going on.
0372	Donald Trump	But to get that  forget all of that.
0373	Donald Trump	Just take a look at the registration as we're going to do it.
0374	Donald Trump	I'm going to set up a commission to be headed by Vice President Mike Pence and we are going to look at it very, very carefully.
0375	Bill O'Reilly	Well, that is good.
0376	Donald Trump	Yes.
0377	Bill O'Reilly	Let's get to the bottom of it.
0378	Bill O'Reilly	Do you ever think you were going to convince the media, the American media, to give  and I know that you don't feel you are getting a fair shot, okay?
0379	Donald Trump	So, you don't, either.
0380	Donald Trump	Because I watch and you say  In many cases 
0381	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]
0382	Bill O'Reilly	You say you're not getting a fair shot because you said, ideology drives the news coverage and it shouldn't.
0383	Bill O'Reilly	News coverage should be news coverage, not ideological.
0384	Bill O'Reilly	What I do, I am an analyst, I can do whatever I want.
0385	Bill O'Reilly	And I have criticized you and you know what and you come right back at me and that is good.
0386	Bill O'Reilly	That is a good thing.
0387	Bill O'Reilly	But there are entities in this country that despise you and your administration.
0388	Bill O'Reilly	Can you, do you think you can ever convince them to take it down a bit?
0389	Bill O'Reilly	Mr. President, thanks very much for taking the time.
