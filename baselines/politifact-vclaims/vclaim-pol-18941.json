(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nLynne Tolmachoff, a spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, analyzed the video for us and concluded that it depicts a flamethrower mounted on a helicopter, not a drone. She also determined that the helicopter was engaging in a standard firefighting tactic called a controlled burn.\u00a0\nWe also traced the video back through social media to find out\u00a0where it originated. The video was first posted on Aug. 21, where it appeared with this caption: \"This is a tactic used to fight a brush fire, as well as other uses...#controlledburn.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControlled burns lower the risk of high-intensity fires by burning through dry fuel collected on forest floors. Firefighting agencies have used both drones and helicopters for this purpose before.\u00a0\nThe tweet is similar to other posts falsely attributing the West Coast wildfires to arson by antifa. Police departments, sheriff's offices and forestry departments have all issued statements saying that these claims are inaccurate.\u00a0In reality, heatwaves, dry soil and drought caused by climate change have made environments on the West Coast more flammable, and sparks and heavy winds have led to fast-spreading blazes throughout the region.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA video shared on Twitter shows aerial footage of an aircraft-mounted flamethrower setting fires in a forest. The caption reads, \"Here is the fire drone video that Twitter, Google, and YouTube didn't want us to see.\"\nA spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection analyzed the video and determined that it depicts a helicopter engaging in a standard firefighting practice called a controlled burn.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18941"}
