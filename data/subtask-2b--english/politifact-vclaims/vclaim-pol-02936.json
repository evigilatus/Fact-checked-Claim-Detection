The president\u2019s already asking for border security, why wouldn\u2019t we add a Dreamer aspect to that as well?\"\nThe administration\u2019s action affects about 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Roughly a quarter of these \u2018Dreamers\u2019 live in California.\nThe Obama-era program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, has allowed them to continue to live and work in the U.S. temporarily, following a vetting process.\nPresident Trump gave Congress six months to find a legislative solution to DACA before the administration formally ends it.\nIn his interview with Rachael Martin of NPR, Denham went on to claim that a DACA/border bill shouldn\u2019t be controversial because top Democrats have supported border security, and specifically a border wall, in years past.\nMARTIN: \"When you say border security, you\u2019re talking about the wall? What do you mean by that?\"\nDENHAM: \"Yes, yes. Which was bipartisan back when (then) Sen. Obama, Sen. Schumer and (then) Sen. Clinton all voted for it. This used to be a very bipartisan thing before President Trump announced it. I think it can be bipartisan once again.\"\nDenham is citing votes by the Democrats in 2006 on an act that authorized a fence. It\u2019s a claim that takes things out of context and was repeated multiple times by Donald Trump during his campaign for president and was made in April by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney.\nAfter he spoke with NPR, Denham repeated the idea of a combined border security and DACA bill in an interview on Capital Public Radio. In that interview, he called border security a bipartisan idea but did not directly call Trump\u2019s wall bipartisan or reveal whether he favors that specific proposal.\nAs PolitiFact has noted several times in the past, the fence voted on in 2006 was less ambitious than the \u2018big, beautiful wall\u2019 Trump has pitched over the past two years and promised Mexico would pay for.\nHere\u2019s PolitiFact\u2019s analysis of this topic:\nThe Secure Fence Act of 2006\nThe Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico.\nThe act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles.\nAt the time the act was being considered, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer were all members of the Senate. (Schumer of New York is now the Senate minority leader.)\nObama, Clinton, Schumer and 23 other Democratic senators voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19.\nOriginally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement.\nCurrently, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this Sept. 15, 2015, file photo, a farmer passes along a borer fence that divides his property, Tuesday, in Mission, Texas.\u00a0(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\nSo how does that compare to Trump\u2019s wall?\nTrump plans for the wall are\u00a0vague, but here\u2019s what we know.\nHe said the wall doesn\u2019t need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher. Cost estimates by others, including this one cited by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., vary widely.\nExperts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence are not too significant because both block people.\nStill, there are obvious differences between the fence and Trump\u2019s wall proposal.\nA 2016 Associated Press report from the border described \"rust-colored thick bars\" that form \"teeth-like slats\" 18 feet high. \"There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself,\" the report said.\nTrump criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign.\n\"Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad,\" Trump said. (Actually, the project didn\u2019t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.)\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the political context surrounding the 2006 vote was different, too. Democrats normally in favor of looser immigration laws saw the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils, according to a Boston Globe report that detailed the legislative process.\nEver since Trump proposed his wall during the presidential campaign, Democrats have called it overkill and too expensive.\nMeanwhile, PolitiFact California asked Denham\u2019s spokeswoman for evidence to support the claim. She pointed to the votes by Obama, Clinton and Schumer in 2006.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Denham has made a puzzling claim about \u2018bipartisan\u2019 efforts in Congress. In May, he told town hall attendees that the process that led to the GOP health care bill, passed exclusively by House Republicans, was \"bipartisan.\" We found it was a poor choice of words given how little cooperation there was over the bill. Experts told us it applied only in the most bare bones sense that both Republicans and Democrats had a chance to read and scrutinize the bill in committees.\nOur ruling\nDenham recently claimed that Obama, Schumer and Clinton voted for a border wall in 2006.\nThey did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico.\nStill, the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a \"nothing wall.\"\nPolitiFact has rated several similar claims Half True, noting they are partially accurate but ignore important context.\nDenham\u2019s claim also gets it about half right, but leaves out key information.\nWe rate it Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2017-09-06 23:30:53 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  https://www.npr.org/2017/09/05/548598074/denham-protecting-dreamers-is-a-way-for-congress-to-come-together Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton \"all voted for\" a border wall as senators.
