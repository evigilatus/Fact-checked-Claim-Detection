Now it's for them.\"", "truth_label": "true", "date": "stated on April 26, 2007 in Stratham, N.H.:", "title": "McKinn instead of tax cuts", "text": "Romney's right that McCain changed tax cuts. When the cuts were first proposed in 2001, McCain joined the Democrats in voting against them. At that time, he said that tax exemptions had not been sufficient for the middle class, because of the need to increase defence spending. In 2003, gradual cuts were accelerated in 2001 but McCain again voted no, saying that taxes should not be cut in time of war. But in 2006, when the cuts were extended, McCain voted yes because he said that opposing the extension of existing cuts would be a tax increase. On January 13, 2021, in a story written by General David Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, he rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security purposes, and told her \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman: January 17, 2021, this article was updated to correct the reasons given by McCain at the time to oppose tax cuts in 2001. Our initial publication attributed its reasons to his subsequent statements on financial restraint.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00313"}
