Mitch McConnell in the Kentucky race went to the US Senate. The Minister of the State of Kentucky, Grimes, now supports the democratic effort to raise it to $10.10 an hour. In the debate of the Kentucky Senate on October 13, McConnell, who nominated himself for a sixth term in office, explained his opposition to raising the minimum wage by claiming that the report of the Budget Office of Congress states that \"between half a million and a million jobs will be destroyed (by raising the federal minimum wage). \"This is not how we grow our economy.\" But Grimes replied that McConnell was picking up cherry data from the report. \"The whole story of CBO's report is that it will help to lift a million - more than a million - Americans out of poverty,\" she said. We looked at Maconel's assertion in a separate examination of the facts and said it was often true. The report stated that job losses were likely to range from \"a very small reduction in employment\" to 1 million jobs, with an average range estimate of 500,000 jobs. But what did the central office say about the other side of the book, the people who would be lifted out of poverty by raising the minimum wage? We decided to take a look. President Barack Obama invited Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 by 2016. In the following years, increases in the minimum wage will be linked to inflation. There are 23 states where the minimum wage already exceeds the federal minimum wage, while the rest of the country (including Kentucky) either sets the minimum wage at $7.25, links the minimum wage in the state to the federal amount, or does not set any minimum wage at all. The minimum wages for eight states are scheduled to increase to at least $10, but in most cases this will only occur no later than 2016. So this increase, if successful, will affect most of the country. In 2016, the federal poverty level is expected to reach $24,100 for a family of four. According to community-based organizations, raising the minimum wage to 10.10 billion would increase the net income of those living at or below the federal poverty level by $5 billion. This is sufficient to transport 900,000 people from about 45 million people living below the federal poverty level above that threshold. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, but it is not exactly what Grimes said. While she first said \"one million Americans,\" she quickly corrected herself to say that raising the minimum wage to 10.10 would raise \"more than one million Americans from poverty.\" The actual figure is close to a million, but certainly not \"more.\" After discussion, the Grimes campaign told us that the candidate misspoked both times and was meant to say \"almost a million.\" The estimate of 900,000 community-based organizations is a net figure. This means that not only those who will exceed the poverty line if the minimum wage rises to $10.10 per hour, but also those who will move below it. How can a person move below the poverty line if the minimum wage rises? As mentioned earlier, community organizations estimate that somewhere between a few people and a million people can lose their jobs as a result of the rise in the minimum wage. Some businesses may have to reduce the number of workers to pay increased wages to other workers, which can have a ripple effect on the economy, leading to the loss of some 500,000 jobs by the end of 2016. Thus, more than 900,000 people can emerge from poverty, some of them even being compensated by people moving into poverty as a result of the increase in the minimum wage. The report of community-based organizations does not mention how many of the 500,000 jobs lost would push people into poverty, and it is urgent to place any number on them. If one member of the family loses a job as a result of the rise in the minimum wage, this does not always mean that the family now lives in poverty. The job lost may be that of a teenage child or one of the parents in a two-income household. In both cases, the net figure - 900A - is the most important one telling the whole story. In general, Grimes is right that there is another aspect of the Central Bureau report that is not reflected in the McConnell comments. As noted in the report: \"The increase in the minimum wage will have two main effects on low-wage workers: the great majority will be the highest wage and income for the family, but a much smaller group will be unemployed and with much lower family income.\" The Governor Grimes said that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would raise \"more than a million Americans from poverty.\" The report I published puts the net figure just under one million, about 900,000. Later, the Grimes campaign said that she had misspoked, but our job was to check what the candidates said to the voters at the time. Grimes said he was close, but not quite on the ball. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07146"}
