Rick Perry depicts social security and medical care as the \"Bonzi scheme\" in a conversation with the Republican university. \"I'm talking about these two programs as one because they're in the same long-term insolvency, which means they won't be around us, which means we're pushing in a system, you know, the Ponzi scheme,\" told the University students at George Washington University in Washington on September 18th. \"Rick Perry said so. This is one of the few things I think Rick Perry contributed when he ran for president last time -- and I worked for him, so I could say that. She wrote the Miami Herald Naked Policy blog about Corbello's comments that were picked up by a tracker while he was in Washington for fund-raising. Many of the students who heard Corbello's voice from Florida. Corbello is facing the U.S. Republic of Joe Garcia in a province of many older people from Miami to Key West, so his comments have drawn a lot of attention. :: Polyte Fact assessed several allegations of whether social security was a Ponzi scheme, including two that we assessed as false by Perry, leading to the 2012 presidential election. We found some similar problems in Corbello's claim of medical care. Social security is different from the Ponzi schemes. We asked the spokesperson for the Corbello campaign to provide evidence that the programs are the Ponzi schemes. Gaitan Valley sent us a statement that Corbello was using a \"spoken personality\" and wanted to maintain programs for present and future generations. There was no evidence that the programmes were the Ponzi scheme. Corbello has made some general proposals for reform, including linking benefits to life expectancy (which is already occurring in part in the medical care system) and changing how to calculate the cost-of-living adjustment. But first, what's the Ponzi scheme? The term originated with Charles Bonzie, a Boston impostor who tricked investors from millions in 1920 by promising returns of up to 100 percent in 90 days on investments in foreign postage vouchers. After the investors reaped these profits in the first round, others pushed to Bonzie without realizing that his \"profits\" consisted of money paid by other investors. That strategy is unsustainable. In contrast, social security is more like a pay-as-you-go system, which transfers tax payments on salaries paid by workers to retirees. The 2009 Department of Social Security online newspaper stated: \"The United States social security system has been operating successfully since 1935. Charles Bonzie's plan barely 200 days.\" Mitchell Zakov, a journalist at Boston University who wrote a book on Bonzie, pointed to three critical differences between social security and the Ponzi scheme. We will summarize Zakov's comments from an earlier fact study: \"First, in the case of social security, no one is lost,\" Zakov wrote in an article in January 2009 in Fortune magazine. \"Social security is exactly what he claims: a compulsory transfer payment system under which current workers are taxed to pay their dues, without promises of substantial returns.\" \u2022 Second, he wrote: \"The Ponzi scheme is unsustainable because the number of potential investors is ultimately exhausted.\" While social security is facing a huge burden due to the retirement of children, it can be and has been modified, and the Government can change the benefits formula or take other steps, such as increasing taxes, to prevent the system from failing. \u2022 Third, Zakov wrote: \"Social security is morally contrary to the Ponzi scheme. At the height of the Great Depression, our society was determined (see social) to create a safety net (see...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  This means, through design, a certain amount of wealth transfer, with rich workers supporting the poorest workers. This may be arranged, but it's not a fraud.\" Michael Tanner, a social security expert at the Liberal Cato Institute, says that the social security systems and Bunzi share certain characteristics -- for example, in the early stages there's an unexpectedly large gain while those later get smaller returns. In a fund-raising e-mail on June 28, 2010, Ron Klein stated that West had raised $2 million from those who would leave our shores in ruins, end social security and medical care, and give companies free judgment. \u2022 July 1, 2010, Bonzie did not have the authority of the federal government. Tanner said: \"In the end, the Ponzi scheme collapses and cannot make people keep giving it money, but social security can always force people to pay.\" \"Theoretically, social security can always go out and raise taxes to maintain the flow of benefits.\" The Medicare Medicare programme, which pays for medical care for older persons, as well as for young people with disabilities, covers 51 million people. (You can read more detail in the fact-finding of the allegations made by the United States Republic of America, Paul Ryan, that medical care will break, which Polyte Fact and Wisconsin have often classified as false.) Medical care has two main components and is funded differently. The main source of funding for Part A, Hospital Insurance, is the withholding of the salaries of the Federal Anti-Corruption Agency. In other words, it pays first-hand: contributions from current workers (and their employers) finance the care of current beneficiaries. The Government &apos; s General Fund covers most of the costs of part B, which helps to pay for the medical, outpatient and other services, and to a lesser extent the premiums paid by the beneficiaries. Part B also has a trust fund, but it differs from part A in that, whenever expenditure exceeds income, the difference is automatically covered by transfers from the General Fund. There is also part C - the advantage of medical care, which is an alternative to private insurance for part A and does not have a trust fund. Part D, a prescription for medicines, is listed in Part B. Both social security and medical care face enormous burdens in the future, and they are vulnerable to problematic demographic trends as the number of workers supporting each retiree has declined significantly over decades. However, budget experts say it's not Bonze's plans. The programmes face a partial decrease as the number of new workers paid into the system increases more slowly than older persons receiving benefits. However, both programmes received funds from public revenues to fill the gap, and Edward Lorenzen, Senior Adviser on the Non-Party Committee for the Responsible Federal Budget, said. Lorenzen said, \"while the Bunzi scheme is by nature unsustainable, medical care and social security programmes can become sustainable with changes in benefits and taxes.\" However, \"the longer we wait for those changes, the greater the magnitude of the changes that must be made.\" Josh Gordon, policy manager of the Concord Alliance, a group calling for balanced budgets, said. \"The only difference with medical care is that on his face it is less 'like' the Ponzi scheme because the system for medical care is designed to be public revenue (not earmarked taxes) paying 75 per cent of the costs -- just like any other government program paid by the public revenue pool.\" The governor Corbello said that social security and medical care are the Ponzi scheme. The Ponzi scheme is by definition an illegal crime and an unsustainable group that collapses very quickly. Social security and medical care, which have existed for decades, are not criminal schemes. The two programmes face the enormous challenge of reducing the number of workers paying benefits to current retirees, and budget experts say that Congress can make changes to make them more sustainable in the future - although many politicians are reluctant to gamble with the support of current senior voters. Corbello raises a legitimate point about the need for reform, but this is quite different from the designation of these programs as \"Bonzi schemes.\" We value this allegation wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d7b36257-5440-4096-9e67-6efaaec92f5b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07258"}
