I have a 90% \u2014 94% approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That\u2019s an all-time record. Can you believe that? Isn\u2019t that something? I love records.\"\nTrump does enjoy strong support among Republican voters. But no public poll backs up the stellar performance he touted. We emailed the White House to point us to the poll Trump relied on. We did not hear back.\nLooking at support among Republican voters, Trump\u2019s highest number in the latest polls is 87% from Gallup. CNN comes in second at 86%. The other four are lower.\n\nAll polls are based on surveys done at the end of May. No margin of error, among the polls that provide them, would be large enough to deliver the 94% that Trump claimed.\nSetting no records\nTrump\u2019s approval among Republicans has generally held in the mid-to-high 80s, which would qualify as robust. Gallup clocked in a slightly higher number of 90% in March and April. That sort of shift is within the normal variation in polling.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe checked out whether Trump\u2019s Republican approval was at an all-time high, both at this point in comparable tenures or all-time, as he said.\nAt this point in his administration (around the 860-day mark), Trump\u2019s approval comes in a bit behind George W. Bush, who held a 94% approval rating within his party, as did his father George H.W. Bush. Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon brought up the rear, getting the nod from just 79% of Republican voters in May of their third year in office. Here\u2019s the full picture, going back to Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nTrump once claimed that he had the highest polling numbers \"in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.\" We rated that False. Not only have other presidents in the recent past enjoyed higher numbers, but there is no data from Lincoln\u2019s time. That is pure invention.\nFor real record-setting, look to George W. Bush who, according to Gallup, won approval from 99% of Republicans in the month after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"I\u2019ve had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90% \u2014 94% approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That\u2019s an all-time record.\"\nWhile his numbers hold steady in the mid-to-high 80s, no poll puts him at 94%. Nor did the White House point to a poll with that level of support. Still, 87% or 89% approval is a strong showing.\nWhere Trump went overboard was in saying he had set some kind of all-time record. That didn\u2019t happen.\nThe statement as a whole is partially accurate, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00558"}
