Trump said in a speech delivered in New York on June 22, 2016. \"Just look at her pathetic e-mail and server data, or her fake landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack. On that journey in Bosnia, Trump chose one of Clinton's most remarkable excesses. When I made that allegation, we evaluated it on fire pants in 2008. Here's the reason. During an introduction to the Foreign Policy Address on Iraq on 17 March 2008, Hillary Clinton remembered her days as First Lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, in March 1996. \"I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get to the vehicles to get to our base.\" But this is not what happened, as shown by the CBS News video that shows Clinton's arrival on the runway under any visible coercion, and salutes the child who gives her a copy of a poem. The fact-finding examiner in Washington also took a skeptical view of Clinton's comments, noting that the review of more than 100 news stories since then had not documented any security threats to the First Lady. The CBS reporter, Cheryl Atkesson, who covered Clinton's visit to Bosnia, wrote about her memories of the trip: \"It certainly wasn't a \"safe\" trip for the First Lady: there was a great risk of travelling to Bosnia, even for the President's wife, under the vigilant protection of the United States army. It took her some courage to go. But I do not recall, nor have I noticed, any imminent calls on this journey by sniper fire or any other dangers.\" Immediately after the speech that day, Clinton &apos; s reporter asked for remarks from others about the trip that they suggested was the opportunity to film instead of foreign policy, and she stood next to her story of sniper fire. \"There was no greeting ceremony, and we were basically told to run into our cars. Now, that's what happened,\" she said. On March 24, 2008, the editorial board of the Philadelphia Daily News reported that it was \"misspeaking wrong,\" and corrected itself to tell it that there was a threat of shooting in the area. The next day she told the reporters, \"So I made a mistake. This is happening. This shows that I'm a human being, and for some people it's the revelation.\" On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers in a story written by General David H. Berger, the US Navy commander, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines to provide security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman on January 17, 2021 on the electoral campaign track, Clinton discussed the danger of the previous trip and how it gave it an important foreign-policy experience. De Moin's record reported it on December 30, 2007, \"We landed in one of those keys and escaped because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the runway there.\" It is interesting that Clinton &apos; s live history memoirs have been conceived, albeit dangerous, to include neither actual sniper shooting nor running. It corresponds to CBS footage and appears to contradict Clinton's subsequent statement: \"Security conditions have been constantly changing in the former Yugoslavia, and have recently deteriorated again. Because of reports of snipers in the hills surrounding the airstrip, we had to stop a short event on the runway with local children, although we had time to meet with them and their teachers and to learn how much effort they had made during the war to continue lessons anywhere safe they could find. An eight-year-old girl gave me a copy of a poem I wrote entitled \"Peace.\" \"There is no doubt that flying to Bosnia was dangerous in 1996, but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire, And there was a welcome party where a young girl gave her a poem. Our referee Trump said that Clinton claimed to have been attacked, but it turns out that the attack was young girls delivering her flowers. In all major respects, Trump is right. Clinton claimed that it landed in Bosnia under sniper fire and that there was no greeting. I then retracted the entire statement. The only flaw in Trump's speech was that he said that Clinton delivered flowers. It was a poem, which seems like a trivial difference. We're assessing this claim right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea63fd8e-0b2a-4426-9a73-fab000398202", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04803"}
