Pat Roberts of Kansas is doing everything he can to paint his opponent -- the independent Greg Orman -- as a liberal follower. One of Roberts &apos; favorite points is Orman &apos; s position on the Affordable Care Act. Orman says he does not support the Health Care Act, but he also says that pushing legislation to repeal it is impractical, because President Barack Obama will simply reject it. In a recent online video, Roberts treats this view as support for Obamakari. The announcement starts with a video of Orman shaking hands with the voters, someone asking him a question about abolishing Obama's care. Orman answers: \"That's an interesting question,\" and he moves down the line. \"Greg Orman will not cancel Obama's care,\" says the novelist in the ad, even if 20,000 people lose their health insurance because of it. Roberts was expected to easily win a fourth term (the last time Kansas was democratically elected to the Senate in 1932). The democratic candidate Chad Taylor withdrew, and the independent Orman implored in the polls. Now the race is a throw-up. Some believe that Roberts wins as necessary to control the Republican Senate in 2015. The candidates say they don't support Obama's healthcare law, but we wanted to know how the law affected Kansas -- did 20,000 people really lose their health insurance? The answer seems to be no. How many humans have lost their insurance? We asked Linda Sheppard, health insurance consultant for the Kansas Insurance Department, how many people had lost his insurance because of Obama's care. The State did not require health insurance providers to report when people went into or cut off coverage, so the answer could not be conclusively known. However, Sheppard said that insurance companies must investigate the section when deciding to terminate the policy. Thus, 20,000 people who lose health insurance are likely to get their attention. \"We're not aware of any widespread policy cancellation,\" she said. Here's what happened. About a year ago, in October 2013, the largest insurance carrier in Kansas - Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Kansas - sent letters to about 9,450 policy holders, according to several news reports. These members will not be able to renew their 2014 plans because they do not comply with new standards under the Affordable Care Act. Shepherd told us there were no official numbers of people who received these notices from insurance companies except Blue Cross and Blue S.H.I.E.L.D. from Kansas. On January 13, 2021, bloggers mentioned the remarkable facts in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, said that they rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use Marines for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" Roberts' announcement on January 17, 2021 quotes 200,000 of October 2013's October 2013 story from Kansas Watch Dog, a conservative news site. According to this story, the Blue Cross and the Blue Shield of Kansas City (mainly from Missouri but serving two provinces of Kansas State) sent notifications to some 10,000 Kansas policy bearers, in addition to 9,450 Blue Cross and Blue Shield from Kansas State. For Roberts, this is where the story ends. But in fact, thousands of people who received these messages didn't end up without insurance. In November following the failure of the implementation of the health care system.gov (Kansas uses the federal market) Obama announced that those who responded to these non-renewable notices could maintain their policies until 2014. In March this year, Kansas approved another transitional policy that allowed all of these policies to continue until 2016. According to Sheppard's understanding that the Kansas insurance companies turned and retreated from those non-renewable notices -- which means that thousands of people who received those notices were able to maintain their health insurance. The withdrawal of non-renewable notices caused some challenges behind the scenes for carriers, but \"for the consumer it was very easy,\" said Scott Brunner, chief analyst at the Kansas Health Institute, a non-profit think tank. Of course, these policymakers could have chosen not to renew. They could have chosen a different plan, turned into a different insurance provider or dropped the insurance altogether - but were not forced out of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Roberta Riportella, a community health professor at Kansas State University who supports affordable care law, said \"It is tricky to focus on those who have lost insurance without acknowledging that this does not mean that they are currently (uninsured).\" It also ignores Roberts' announcement that the number of uninsured Kansas who have received coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Because the State does not accurately track the number of insured persons, and the law has only been fully implemented this year, it is difficult to know for sure how many people have received insurance as a result of Obama's care. But about 57,000 Kansas are now registered in the health insurance market, as Riportella said. If Kansas follows national estimates, then almost half of these people were not believed before. Bruner said that there was no evidence to suggest that the number of people who were not currently insured was higher than before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. \"Expect that with the law of affordable care that the number will continue to decline,\" he said. Our verdict, Roberts, said, \"Twenty thousand people lost their health insurance because of Obamakari.\" There is no official information to support Roberts &apos; claim. Several thousand Kansas received notifications that their insurance plans could not be renewed because they did not comply with Obama &apos; s welfare standards, but the notices were withdrawn about a month later. Meanwhile, some 57,000 Kansas received health care insurance. If the State follows the national trend, nearly half of these persons are not insured before the law. We appreciate Roberts' claim is false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07170"}
