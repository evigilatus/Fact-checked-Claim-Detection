They have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly; they need specific assurances that their citizenship really means something, that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II, and that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.\"\n\n\nObama doesn't mention Muslims here at all; he's clearly talking about U.S. citizens of Arab and Pakistani descent.\n\n\nAlso, the e-mail says Obama would \"stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction,\" implying he made a statement to that effect. But it's clear in reading the text that the words actually represent a question Obama is being asked by his audiences: \"they need specific assurances ... that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.\"\n\n\nThough Obama doesn't say so explicitly, he gives the impression his answer is yes.\n\n\nThe e-mail distorts Obama's quote and misrepresents who he was talking about, lumping together an entire religion when he was talking to two groups of people in the context of discrimination. It's a significant alteration to the meaning of what Obama said, and we find it to be False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16183"}
