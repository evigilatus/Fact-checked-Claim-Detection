Now, there is a widely shared social media tour site that presents a picture of Trump with the following quote, attributed to 2013: \"The closure is based on the President's lack of leadership. He can't even control his party and bring people together in a room. \"Closing means the president is weak.\" Did Trump really say that? The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This was supposed to be said during the 2013 government closure during the Obama administration. We were not able to find this exact quote from Trump, in tweet or otherwise, but we followed several comments made at the time of the Government &apos; s closure in 2013, which supported the idea of blaming the President. The first time this alleged quote came to light earlier this year, when the government closed from January 20 to January 22, 2018. This closure was due to disagreement over the deferred programme of work for the arrival of children, known as the Development Assistance Committee (DAC). President Barack Obama was criticized by Trump during the 17-day closure of October 2013. This occurred after the budget for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as \"Obamakari,\" was challenged. But what did Trump actually say in 2013? We could not find a match with the quote attributed to Trump, but we identified similar comments. In an interview with Fox and Friends in September 2013, Trump blew up Obama for failing to \"get everyone into a room.\" Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Butterman (January 12, 2021) \"If you say who is being expelled, it must always be the highest. The problems begin from the top, they must be resolved from the top, the President is the leader, he must put everyone in a room, and he must drive. And he doesn't do it, he doesn't like it, and that's not his power.\" Trump also said that at the bottom of history \"when they talk about closing the government, they'll talk about the President of the United States, who was the President at the time. They won't talk about who was the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Speaker of the Senate, who runs things in Washington. So I really think that pressure on the president.\" On October 7, 2013, an interview with Greta Van Susteren, the host of Fox News, criticized Trump (Obama) for not being a dealmaker during the closure. \"You have to get everyone in a room. You must be a leader. The president has to lead. He has to get the Council Speaker and everyone in a room, and they have to make a deal. You gotta be nice and angry and wild and do everything, but you gotta get a deal. \"Unfortunately, he's never been a dealmaker before. This wasn't his experience before he got into politics, and it's obviously not his now. But you have to get people in a room and you have to get a deal.\" A few days later, Trump appeared on CNN for an interview with Pierce Morgan, reiterating that closing means Obama \"don't drive and don't put people in a room.\" Trump also took to Twitter before, during and after the closure to express his opinion, he agreed with users that this would never happen if the President and Obama were \"a failure to drive.\" In fact, the reason Americans worry about closing the government is that Obama refuses to pass the budget.

We could not find an example when Trump said these exact words together, but repeated similar statements on social media and in interviews at the time, saying \"pressuring the President\" during the closure and that \"the President must get everyone in a room and be a leader.\" The statement is partially accurate but omits important details.
