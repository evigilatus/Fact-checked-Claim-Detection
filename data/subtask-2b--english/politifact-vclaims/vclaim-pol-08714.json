Paul LePage says 47 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aren't working", "text": "Maine\u2019s Republican governor, Paul LePage, has a history of making controversial comments, from telling the NAACP that the group can \"kiss my butt\" to charging that a Democratic legislative leader \"claims to be for the people but he\u2019s the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline.\"\nRecently, LePage made another comment that has attracted national attention.\nOn Oct. 22, 2013, a blogger for the Bangor Daily News posted an audio clip from a speech LePage made in Falmouth, Maine. Here\u2019s what the blogger wrote:\n\"Informed that the event was wrapping up, LePage said he had two more points to make. The first was just one word: \u2018energy.\u2019 The second was, he said, in reference to \u2018workforce development.\u2019\n\"\u2018About 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don\u2019t work,\u2019 said LePage.\n\"On the recording you can hear a member of the audience ask, \u2018What?\u2019 LePage repeats himself. \u2018About 47 percent. It\u2019s really bad.\u2019\"\nThe blog post inspired a flurry of media attention, in part because LePage\u2019s comment echoed the one from the 2012 presidential campaign in which Republican nominee Mitt Romney said that 47 percent of the American people are \"dependent upon government.\" Romney\u2019s comment was widely considered a blunder that hampered his bid for the White House.\nBut what about the substance of LePage\u2019s remark? Was he correct that \"about 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don\u2019t work\"? The strength or weakness of Maine\u2019s labor market isn\u2019t out of the mainstream; the unemployment rate in August 2013 was 7.0 percent, putting it in a six-way tie for 22nd place nationally.\nWe contacted LePage\u2019s press office for supporting evidence, but no one responded. A spokeswoman for LePage did send Huffington Post a statement, saying in part that \"the governor understands that not everyone who is dependent on taxpayer dollars is 'able-bodied,' but he does believe that everyone, regardless of their ability or physical condition, can contribute to society in a meaningful way.\"\nThe Census Bureau found that Maine\u2019s estimated population in 2012 was 1,329,192. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that in August 2013, Maine had 659,059 people employed. So by the roughest calculation, Maine had 670,133 people not working, or about 50 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis number would suggest that LePage is in the ballpark. But calling this a \"rough\" calculation is too kind. It\u2019s actually a silly way of calculating it.\nFirst, doing it this way suggests that everybody -- no matter how old or young -- should be working. The numbers change dramatically if you exclude Maine residents up to age 18 and over 65 from the statistics.\nIn 2012, Maine\u2019s 18-to-64 population was 836,898. Using this as the denominator means that about 21 percent of Maine residents were not working.\nWhat about LePage\u2019s reference to \"able-bodied people\"? The Census Bureau has estimated that in 2011, Maine had 101,000 people aged 18 to 64 who have a \"health problem or disability which prevents them from working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do.\"\nIf you subtract this group, then there were 735,898 \"able-bodied people\" age 18 to 64 in Maine, and only 10 percent of them were not working.\nFinally, in August 2013, there were 49,966 unemployed people in Maine. These are people who have looked for work recently but have not found it. If you add these to the number of employed Maine residents, then just 3.6 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aged 18 to 64 are neither working nor actively looking for employment.\nThat\u2019s far off from the 47 percent LePage claimed.\nIt\u2019s possible to quibble about the specifications we\u2019ve used, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. For instance, you could get a bit closer to LePage\u2019s 47 percent figure if you counted 16- and 17-year olds or people up to age 74, who have been working in growing numbers in recent years.\nStill, Burtless said, \"even if you tried to include all the \u2018able-bodied\u2019 Maine residents past 65 in your calculations, I'm pretty confident you'd find Gov. LePage's claim to be ridiculous.\"\nOur ruling\nLePage said that \"about 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don\u2019t work.\" Unless LePage thinks newborns and nonagenarians ought to get off their tushes and find a job, this is a ridiculous claim.\nIn reality, only about 10 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aged 18 to 64 aren\u2019t employed. And if you include those who are actively looking for work but who can\u2019t find a job in today\u2019s poor economy, the figure drops as low as 3.6 percent.
