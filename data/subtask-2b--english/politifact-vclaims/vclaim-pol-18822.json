It came on the same day that the U.S. reported a record number of new cases and around 1,000 deaths due to the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University, the COVID Tracking Project and other sources.\u00a0\n\"There is no other way to slice these data \u2014 1,000 deaths per day is most assuredly not \u2018nothing,\u2019\" said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University.\nShe called the claim \"particularly absurd\" and \"extraordinarily cruel\" to those who have recently\u00a0lost loved ones to the virus.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nRecent daily death counts\nThe death rate has declined since the spring. Some explanations that have come up in our reporting include doctors understanding the disease better and masks becoming more common.\nBut Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the recent daily death tallies can \"by no measure\" be considered \"almost nothing.\"\u00a0\nThe Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus testing czar, Adm. Brett Giroir, said Oct. 28 that with the recent upticks in cases and hospitalizations, \"we are starting to see the increase in deaths.\"\n\nRELATED: No, fight against coronavirus isn't rounding the corner, as Donald Trump said\nAs the calendar turns to November, the U.S. has had more than 229,000 COVID-19 deaths, the most in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University. That\u2019s nearly 20% of the world\u2019s total, in a country with about 4% of the global population.\nData from Johns Hopkins University and the World Health Organization shows the U.S. has also reported more deaths on a per capita basis than a number of other similar countries.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne recent CDC study said the U.S. has seen \"excess deaths\" related to the coronavirus every week since March. The study said the U.S. has lost an estimated 299,028 more lives since Jan. 26, 2020, than would be expected.\n\"These are deaths that we wouldn\u2019t normally expect,\" said Mary Jo Trepka, a professor and the chair of the epidemiology department at Florida International University.\n\nActivists mark\u00a0200,000 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. with American flags on the National Mall in Washington on Sept. 22, 2020. (AP)\nRELATED: COVID-19 by the numbers: A status report\nProvisional death counts are lagging and incomplete\nTrump\u2019s Instagram post shows a chart that is labeled Oct. 26. The image says that data comes from the CDC, and it includes a link that directs to the agency\u2019s provisional death count data.\nAlexis C. Madrigal, a reporter with the Atlantic who helped launch the COVID Tracking Project, noted on Twitter that Trump appeared to have made \"a common misinterpretation\" of what the provisional death counts are able to show.\nThe provisional death counts lag by a few weeks, because they are based on death certificates that take time to report and process. The CDC says its provisional death counts \"may differ from other published sources.\" The agency says the data is \"incomplete\" and \"will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods.\"\u00a0\nFor those reasons, experts told PolitiFact that the provisional counts shouldn\u2019t be used to draw conclusions about the impact of the virus in the most recent weeks.\u00a0\n\"There\u2019s such a delay in terms of the classification of deaths that of course it\u2019s going to look like there\u2019s hardly any deaths over the last couple of weeks,\" Trepka said.\u00a0\n\"You can\u2019t say anything definitive about provisional data when we know there are likely to be revisions,\" Adalja added.\u00a0\nThe more telling figures, Trepka said, are the excess death estimates over time.\nScientists have warned that colder weather and state reopenings could bring a staggering death toll in the winter, as the continued coronavirus threat overlaps with the flu season.\n\"If things do not change, if they continue on the course we\u2019re on, there\u2019s going to be a whole lot of pain in this country with regard to additional cases and hospitalizations and deaths,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, in an Oct. 28 interview with CNBC.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the number of coronavirus deaths is \"almost nothing.\"\nExperts rejected the claim, which came on a day when the U.S. reported roughly 1,000 new coronavirus deaths. The country leads the world with over 229,000 total COVID-19 deaths.\u00a0\nWith those numbers, it\u2019s ridiculous to say deaths are down to \"almost nothing.\"\nTrump pointed viewers to a post on his Instagram account that appeared to show provisional death counts from the CDC. But his post left out a key CDC disclaimer, which said that such provisional counts are incomplete due to lags in reporting death certificate results. The result was a gross misrepresentation of where the trend lines are heading.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18822"}
