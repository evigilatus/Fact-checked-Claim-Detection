Rick Scott may have signed a $1.3 billion cut to K-12 education in his first year, but he\u2019s now touting \"record\" funding for public schools and teacher pay raises later in his term.\nScott unveiled his education budget proposal at a Delray Beach elementary school on Jan. 27, 2014. In an accompanying press release, he said, \"The $18.8 billion in funding for K-12 education funding is the highest in Florida history and includes a record $10.6 billion in state funds.\"\nWe wondered: If the state Legislature goes along with Scott\u2019s request, would $18.8 billion in total -- including the state\u2019s portion of $10.6 -- be the highest in Florida history? Let\u2019s pull out our calculators and budget documents from past years and find out.\nTotal dollars\nScott made similar claims about proposing record K-12 education spending last year.\nTo determine whether a budget proposal is a \"record,\" we have to examine the total size of the pot, the state portion and the per-pupil spending.\nThe Florida Education Finance Program, the main source of dollars for K-12 education, is by law a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars called the \"required local effort,\" with an amount dictated by the state. In some recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars.\nIn 2013, Scott signed a budget that included $18.3 billion for K-12 education, including the state\u2019s contribution of $10.5 billion for 2013-14.\nScott\u2019s $18.8 billion proposal for 2014-15 -- including $10.6 billion in state dollars -- would be an increase by about $542 million in raw dollars. (Of course, we\u2019ll have to wait to see if the Legislature goes along with that plan when it convenes in March.)\nBut that doesn\u2019t fully answer the question about whether Scott is on track for record K-12 education spending.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer-pupil spending\nThat\u2019s because another way to compare education funding over time is to look at per-pupil spending. Scott\u2019s budget request equals $6,949 per student, compared with\u00a0$6,780 this year. That means Scott requested a per-pupil increase of about $169. (That\u2019s an estimate, since we don\u2019t know yet how many more or fewer students the state will have next year.)\nThe problem for Scott is that $6,949 per student is not a record for per pupil spending.\nA chart comparing state spending over a decade through Scott\u2019s recommendation last year show that per-pupil funding peaked in 2007-08 -- before the recession -- at $7,126. At the time, Charlie Crist was governor; he was then a Republican and is now running as a Democrat against Scott to win his old job back. In 2007-08 Florida had about 67,000 fewer students than it does today, and the state\u00a0spent more money per student.\nInflation\nAnother way to measure whether Scott is proposing a record amount of spending is to\u00a0use an inflation calculator, in order to fairly compare amounts spent during different years.\nIf we take the $9.7 billion in state spending for 2007-08 and adjust for inflation, it would equal about $10.5 billion in 2013 -- so Scott would still be correct that his proposed $10.6 billion in state spending is higher. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price Index inflation calculator doesn\u2019t show 2014 yet.)\nBut if we take the total spending for 2007-08 -- $18.75 billion -- and\u00a0adjust for inflation,\u00a0that would equal $20.29 billion in 2013, which is still higher than Scott\u2019s recommendation for total spending of $18.8 billion.\nOur ruling\nScott said of his budget proposal that \"the $18.8 billion in funding for K-12 education funding is the highest in Florida history and includes a record $10.6 billion in state funds.\"\nHe is correct that both the sheer dollar total and the state\u2019s portion are larger than in past years. However, per-pupil spending was higher under Crist. Also, factoring in inflation for the total amount for 2007-08 would make it larger than Scott\u2019s current proposal.\nOn balance, we rate Scott\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08331"}
