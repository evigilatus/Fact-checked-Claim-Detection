The day after Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly had an interview with Obama, O\u2019Reilly picked up an additional 1 million viewers for his show The O\u2019Reilly Factor.\nThe president sat down with O\u2019Reilly right before the Super Bowl, and the tone of the conversation itself stirred up a flurry of reactions. Here\u2019s a small example from a moment when O\u2019Reilly pressed Obama on the administration\u2019s response to the attack on the American compound in Benghazi, Libya.\nO\u2019Reilly: If (Ambassador to the United Nations) Susan Rice goes out and tells the world that it was a spontaneous demonstration...\nObama: \u00a0Bill...\nO\u2019Reilly: \u00a0-- off a videotape but your...\nObama: \u00a0Bill...\nO\u2019Reilly: \u00a0-- your commanders and the secretary of Defense know it's a terror attack...\nObama: \u00a0Now, Bill...\nO\u2019Reilly: \u00a0Just...\nObama: \u00a0-- Bill...\nO\u2019Reilly: \u00a0-- as an American...\nObama: \u00a0-- Bill -- Bill...\nO\u2019Reilly: \u00a0-- I'm just confused.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama: \u00a0And I'm -- and I'm trying to explain it to (you), if you want to listen.\nNo wonder that many observers described the interview as testy.\nWashington Post columnist Dana Milbank called it \"the roughest and nastiest exchange\" of the three times that O\u2019Reilly has interviewed Obama.\n\"He interrupted the president 42 times in 10 minutes,\" Milbank said on MSNBC\u2019s Politics Nation. Of all the words uttered in this 10-minute interview, 40 percent were uttered by O\u2019Reilly.\"\nWe wanted to check Milbank\u2019s numbers. Not on the interruptions, but on the word count.\nWe pulled out our digital centrifuge and separated the O\u2019Reilly and Obama utterances. According to our research, O\u2019Reilly delivered 787 words to Obama\u2019s 1,484. This gave O\u2019Reilly 35 percent of the conversation. That\u2019s a little lower than Milbank said but more or less in the same ballpark. We reached out to Milbank and did not hear back.\nTo satisfy our own curiosity, we decided to compare this with another one-on-one interview between the president and a journalist. A couple of days before Obama sat down with O\u2019Reilly, he did the same with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\nWe subjected that transcript to the same rigorous methods and found that Tapper spoke 23 percent of the time, leaving the president the other 77 percent. The precise word counts were Tapper -- 849 and Obama -- 2,886.\nMilbank\u2019s point was that O\u2019Reilly\u2019s interview was almost as much about O\u2019Reilly as it was about the president. We don\u2019t know about that, but we can say that O\u2019Reilly spoke about 50 percent more\u00a0than Tapper did in his interview.\nThe topics in the two interviews differed greatly. O\u2019Reilly brought up Obamacare, the Benghazi attack and the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Tapper focused on issues like immigration reform, legalization of marijuana, spying by the National Security Agency, and security at the Winter Olympics in Sochi.\nO\u2019Reilly had a second installment of his time with Obama that aired the night after the Super Bowl. Milbank\u2019s comment came on the same night, so we\u2019re counting only the segment that had aired publicly at that point.\nFor the record, in the second installment, O\u2019Reilly asked the president about African-American children raised in single-parent households, school vouchers, the Keystone pipeline, a contraceptive coverage exemption for Little Sisters of the Poor, and veterans benefits.\nOur ruling\nMilbank said O\u2019Reilly said 40 percent of the words during his interview with the president. That was a little high. By our count, 35 percent would be more accurate. O\u2019Reilly spoke decidedly more than Tapper did in his time with Obama.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08292"}
