Scott Walker supports taking major actions during a lame-duck session of the Wisconsin Legislature \u2014 a Full Flop from the position he took when he was first elected in 2010.\nAs he enters his final weeks in office, the two-term governor has signaled that he generally supports bills adopted by the GOP-controlled Legislature that would weaken the powers of Gov.-elect Tony Evers, who defeated Walker in the November 2018 election, and incoming Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats.\nThere are also measures that would limit early voting, put lawmakers in charge of litigation aimed at overturning the federal Affordable Care Act and give Republicans more control over the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., the state jobs agency.\nThe Legislature\u2019s lame-duck bills and Walker\u2019s change in position have made national news. They\u2019ve also drawn threats of legal action by liberals and criticism from prominent Republicans calling the move a \"power grab\" and urging Walker not to sign the bills.\nOn Dec. 9, 2018, four days after the measures won approval from the Legislature during an overnight session, Evers appeared on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press.\" He repeated his call for Walker to veto the lame-duck bills, saying:\n\"The entire thing is a mess, it\u2019s a hot mess, and I believe that he should veto the entire package. In fact, at least three or four of the pieces that are in there now, he has vetoed previously. And so, it makes no sense to me.\"\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook.

Peter Barca, D-Kenosha. Barca\u2019s office then produced a memo on the similarities. That memo was cited to us by Evers\u2019 spokeswoman as evidence to back Evers\u2019 claim.\nWe also reviewed a memo on the lame-duck legislation by the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, another nonpartisan state agency.\nWhat we found is that the lame-duck legislation does contain some provisions that are the same -- or similar to -- provisions Walker previously vetoed.\nBut those provisions aren\u2019t the ones in the lame-duck legislation that have caused the big headlines.\nHere\u2019s a look:\n\n\n\n\nWalker 2017 veto\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 GOP lame-duck legislation\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nVeto allowed transfer of funds by Department of Transportation between state highway programs \u00a0\u2014 without legislative oversight.\n\n\nLegislation would repeal altogether DOT's authority to\ntransfer state funds between state highway program components.\n\n\nLess flexibility for Evers\u2019 administration than Walker\u2019s administration.\n\n\n\n\nVeto deleted requirement that Department of Administration do annual report on state\u2019s \"self-funded portal\" for consolidating accounting, budget and other services.\n\n\nWould require the annual report.\n\n\nImposes requirement on Evers administration that Walker administration did not want to do.\n\n\n\n\nVeto deleted requirement that the Department of Veterans Affairs receive approval from Legislature\u2019s Joint Finance Committee before transferring money for state veterans homes to veterans trust fund.\n\n\nWould require \u00a0department to notify the committee of any transfers.\n\n\nWalker vetoed the measure because it would have \"encroached\" on the executive branch\u2019s responsibility to manage state agency programs. The requirement is more of a burden on Evers, given that the Joint Finance Committee is majority Republican.\n\n\n\n\nVeto deleted requirement that Department of Health Services submit report to Legislature\u2019s Joint Finance Committee on Walker initiative to require childless adults to work or get work training in order to receive Medicaid. Veto also eliminated \u00a0requirement that the Joint Finance Committee give approval before the work/work training requirement could be implemented.\n\n\nLegislation would codify into law the work and work training requirement.\n\n\nWithout codifying the initiative into law, Evers administration could have made adjustments to the program; with new legislation, Evers administration would need approval from Joint Finance Committee or full Legislature.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\nEvers said, \"At least three or four of the pieces that are in\" in the Republican lame-duck legislation, Walker \"has vetoed previously.\"\nThere are four provisions in the lame-duck bills that Walker has vetoed previously and that would put new requirements or restrictions on the incoming Evers administration.\nBut those provisions aren\u2019t the major ones in the lame-duck session that have generated so much controversy and threats of lawsuits.\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01194"}
