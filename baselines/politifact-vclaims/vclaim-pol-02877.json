Jos\u00e9 Serrano, D-Bronx, said legislation he\u2019s against would allow convicted felons to own guns.\nThat\u2019s not allowed under federal law for most people with a felony. Serrano said a proposed amendment could change that.\n\"Now Republicans want to restore #gunrights to felons - something they lose after criminal conviction - CJS bills have prevented for 24 years,\" Serrano said in a tweet.\nSerrano was referring to a bill that allocates funds to the U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce and other agencies.\nHe explained his position when the amendment came up for a vote in the House.\n\"I rise in strong opposition to this very misguided amendment,\" Serrano said. \"This amendment would allow felons and other dangerous individuals to try to regain the ability to own guns by sending an application to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\"\nThe amendment was agreed to by a voice vote so there\u2019s no record of who voted which way. The bill it\u2019s tied to has passed the House, but not the Senate.\nDemocrats and Republicans are typically divided when it comes to gun control. But would a Republican amendment allow felons to buy guns?\nThe amendment\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colorado, sponsored the amendment.\nThe amendment would give the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives funding to review applications from people who want to own a gun but legally can\u2019t under federal law.\nPeople who have served more than a year in prison are among that group. A felony conviction typically comes with a minimum prison sentence of one year. Anyone convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence charge or received a dishonorable discharge from the military is also not allowed to own a gun.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ATF has the power to restore gun rights to those people.\nFederal statute says the bureau may do so if they believe the applicant \"will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest.\"\nBut Congress has denied the bureau the funding for such a program.\nCongress since 1993 has said no funds given to the agency \"shall be available to investigate or act upon applications for relief from Federal firearms disabilities.\" That\u2019s the legal term for someone who is not allowed to own a gun.\nThe amendment would allow the agency to dip into federal funds to consider those applications.\nWhat it means\nThe amendment does not give people with criminal convictions free access to firearms. Each person would be evaluated individually by the ATF.\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that an applicant would be granted gun rights. If someone was convicted of a violent crime, for example, the agency may consider the person to be dangerous to public safety and deny the request.\nOther criminal convictions may be seen as a lesser threat to public safety. Someone convicted of embezzlement in the past may be judged differently than someone with a violent felony conviction.\n\"Congressman Buck\u2019s amendment allows the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to once again process petitions from citizens for the restoration of their Second Amendment rights,\" said Kyle Huwa, Buck\u2019s spokesperson. \"This petition process is already established under federal statute. The amendment makes no determination on the substance of the petitions.\"\nOur ruling\nSerrano said Republicans want to restore gun rights to felons.\nAn amendment proposed by a Republican congressman would allow people who have been stripped of their gun rights by the government to ask for them back. That\u2019s not limited to people with a felony and it\u2019s not guaranteed they will be approved.\nSerrano\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification.
