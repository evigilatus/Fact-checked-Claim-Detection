(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nHere\u2019s what happened.\nThe Journal Sentinel, which publishes PolitiFact Wisconsin, posted a news story about the April 18 rally in Brookfield, a Milwaukee suburb. Nearly 1,000 people packed the sidewalk adjacent to a busy thoroughfare, most shoulder to shoulder, to protest Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 decision to extend Wisconsin\u2019s safer-at-home order until May 26.\nThe Facebook post shows two photographs from the rally side by side \u2014 one from the Journal Sentinel and one said to be taken by the poster\u2019s daughter.\u00a0\nThe Journal Sentinel photo shows a man wearing a plaid shirt and jeans among a group of people and holding two flags \u2014 a Confederate flag and just above it, a yellow flag that is harder to make out.\u00a0\nThe other photo with the post shows a man, also in a plaid shirt and jeans, who is not so close to other people. He is clearly holding only a yellow flag.\nThe implication is that in its photo, the Journal Sentinel added the Confederate flag into the man\u2019s hands.\nWhat you\u2019re really seeing\nThe two-flag photo is one of 13 images in a photo gallery that accompanied the Journal Sentinel\u2019s news story about the protest.\u00a0\nAfter Facebook posts appeared making the specious claim, the Journal Sentinel published an article denying that its photo was doctored. The article explained what happened:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 18, the reporter who wrote the news story sent the photo in question from his iPhone to an editor who loaded it directly into the Journal Sentinel's publishing system.\nThe photo shows the man holding a yellow Don't Tread on Me flag and a Confederate flag together on one pole.\u00a0\nOn April 19, a Journal Sentinel photo editor examined the photo and determined it was never edited in Photoshop, even to receive the basic color-toning for reproduction.\nThe article also pointed out that other images taken at the rally, including two videos posted on social media, show a man with the two flags.\nit has gotten much larger pic.twitter.com/vaOtRMrnxf\u2014 Zach Walsh (@Zachwalsh9) April 18, 2020 \n(Confederate flag is visible at the 9-second mark in this tweeted video.)\nOne video shows a man wearing a plaid shirt and baseball cap, holding just a Don't Tread on Me flag, a few feet away from the man holding the Don\u2019t Tread on Me and the Confederate flags.\u00a0\nAnother video also shows a Confederate flag flying below a Don't Tread on Me flag, with another Don't Tread on Me flag nearby.\nThe Journal Sentinel reporter on the scene also captured an image in which both men can be seen. The photos are time-stamped at 11:40 and 11:41 a.m.\nPolitiFact did an Error Level Analysis on the image in question, using FotoForensics, and found that the flags and the people were part of the same JPEG compression. The photo\u2019s metadata also does not show that Photoshop was used.\nIn English: There\u2019s no forensic evidence that the image was doctored.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post showing two photographs from a rally that protested coronavirus stay-at-home orders suggests that one of the photos, taken by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, was doctored.\nOur analysis found the photo, which shows one man holding a Don\u2019t Tread on Me flag and a Confederate flag, was not altered. The person is visible in several other posts we found that were not from the newspaper.\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16970"}
