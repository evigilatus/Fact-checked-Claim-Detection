In giving lectures on what is perceived as the growing influence of companies, Moran suggested that there is a link between the billions of brothers Koch in Kansas - powerful conservative owners in the Koch industries - and their recent preference for the Styrofoam restaurants in the House of Representatives. \"As soon as the Republicans took over the House of Representatives, they threw away all the biodegradable tools we used in the cafeteria and asked us to buy styrofoam cups, dishes, etc. that Dexy made, and, in fact, that's part of Coch Industries,\" he said. Moran added: \"The Executive Director was a partner in Coach Industries, which now benefits from what we have to buy because we are essentially a captive audience in the House of Representatives.\" This sounds like a conspiracy theory worth Oliver Stone's film. But a polyte-fruit check is the best we can do. We asked Moran's press secretary where Congressman came from with his information. She didn't come back to us. The initial statement made by Moran raises two questions: (1) Did the leaders of the Republican Party ask the Government to purchase Styrofoam products from Dixie; and if so, did Koch Industries benefit from this decision? Now for answers. When the Republicans took over the House of Representatives in January, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Management Committee, Dan Lungren, R-Califf, suspended the room tagging programme, which was part of the \"Gren Capitol\" initiative launched by the former majority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Belusi, De-Califf. The programme - which requires the use of biodegradable cups, dishes and tools in the cafeteria - costs $475,000 per year, and a review revealed that it increased the consumption of the public house of energy. The decision was soon broken by Democrats as an environmentally unfriendly decision, although the outgoing Chairman of the Management Committee, Robert A. Brady of Pennsylvania, a democracy, recommended action in December. In fact, the decision led to the transition to Styrofoam. However, Moran &apos; s claim faces serious problems beyond this fact. First, the Republicans did not decide to go to Styrofoam, let alone a company related to a hut. Instead, Catering Companies, a company that manages the cafeteria, was given the discretion to do what they wanted. \"We just said, \"Look, you don't have to use colored - it's not working. It increases our energy, does not reduce our carbon emissions, and costs half a million dollars a year,\" said Sally Wood, spokesman for the Home Management Committee. She said: \"Of course, they will go to the most cost-effective products.\" They went with Wincob, which makes Styrofoam products. While Dixie is a brand under Georgia-Pacific, owned by Coach Industries, Win Cobb has no affiliation whatsoever with Dexy regardless of the fact that her owner, George Wortz, worked years ago as Executive Vice-President of Georgia-Pacific, and obtained by Coch Industries in 2005, a year before he left. \"Resident partners do not currently use Dixie products,\" said Dan Wyser, spokesperson for the Chief Administrative Officer of the home. Let's look back. Moran claims that the Republicans \"ordered\" a transfer to the Strovum products that Dexie made, a brand under the umbrella of Coach Industries. The problem is he's wrong about everything. The seller, and not the Republicans in the House of Representatives, decided to move to Styrofoam to consider the cost after the suspension of the compost programme because of its ineffectiveness and high cost. Even that decision was based on a recommendation by the Democrats. After that, the company selected by the seller, WinCup, is not at all relevant to Dexy or Koch Industries, and is in fact a competitor. The fact that the man who once owned Winkop worked in a company purchased by Coach Industries is irrelevant. Moran must have been wearing a tin paper hat the day he came up with this. Pants on fire!
