Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in a statement on June 5, 2014. \"Only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action. We need to continue working towards patient-centered solutions so all veterans have access to quality healthcare.\"\nIs it true that Senate Democrats only moved to fund new veterans health clinics after the scandal broke in April?\nIn a word: No.\nThe bill Cassidy references is H.R. 3251, the Department of Veterans Affairs Major Medical Facility Lease Authorization Act of 2013. The bill, authored by Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla.,\u00a0authorized the funding of 27 new Veterans Affairs health facilities around the country. On Dec. 10, 2013, the House passed the bill almost unanimously with a vote of 346 to 1. (Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., was the lone \"no\" vote.)\nThe bill stalled in the Senate. In fact, it never made it out of the Veterans' Affairs committee. But as is so often the case, the Senate was working on its own bill, and that one failed because Senate Republicans objected to it.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced S. 1950, the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act of 2014, on Jan. 16. (It would later be renumbered S. 1982). The scope of the bill was much broader than just funding 27 new VA health clinics. For example, it also included an expansion of physical and mental health benefits for some veterans and their families. Whereas Miller\u2019s bill was nine pages, Sanders\u2019 was 367 pages.\nRepublicans objected to several components of Sanders\u2019 bill, including its funding mechanism. Sanders would pay for his bill with money that would have gone toward the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Republicans said those savings were already expected, so it wasn\u2019t a real source of money. (For what it\u2019s worth, the House bill did not really specify where its funding would be taken from.)\nRepublicans also hinged support for the bill on the inclusion of sanctions against Iran.\nDemocrats tried to bring Sanders\u2019 bill up for a vote on Feb. 27. Republicans made a parliamentary maneuver that imposed a 60-vote threshold to bring it to the floor. With just 56 Senators voting \"yea\" \u2014 including two Republicans \u2014 the bill failed to advance.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the ranking Republican on the Veterans' Affairs committee, said he was concerned about the costs and the expansion of the VA when there were already considerable problems with wait times.\nIn a press release, the American Legion lamented the bill\u2019s failure.\n\"There was a right way to vote and a wrong way to vote today, and 41 senators chose the wrong way,\" American Legion National Commander Daniel Dellinger said. \"That\u2019s inexcusable.\"\nThat said, there wasn\u2019t unanimous backing of the bill by veterans groups. In an op-ed, Stew\u00adart Hickey, national exec\u00adu\u00adtive direc\u00adtor for American Veterans, or AMVETS, said Sanders\u2019 \"kitchen sink-like\" bill \"would be morally irre\u00adspon\u00adsi\u00adble and fis\u00adcally unsound.\"\nFor the next couple months, Sen. David Vitter, R-La., and Sanders went back and forth on the status of the veterans bill. On March 11, Vitter offered an amendment to to the House bill that would pay for the new VA clinics through price controls for prescription drugs purchased by the Defense Department. Sanders said he supported the new clinics, but also wanted other provisions included in the comprehensive legislation.\nOn April 9, Miller, the\u00a0chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, announced that dozens of Arizona veterans died waiting for care from the VA, and he had evidence showing that administrators at the Phoenix office were forging wait times.\nThere were multiple points along the way when Sam Foote, a doctor of internal medicine at the Phoenix VA before he retired, attempted to blow the whistle on the bad practices in Arizona, including a December meeting with the Arizona Republic and a letter to the VA inspector general. But it wasn\u2019t until Miller\u2019s comments that the story broke and became a national scandal, eventually leading to the resignation of Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.\nAlso on April 9, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. \u2014 who Cassidy is challenging for Senate in November \u2014 actually called for the House Republican bill to be discharged from the Senate Veteran Affairs committee. But that effort was blocked by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who asked for Vitter\u2019s amendment to be included. Sanders objected.\n\"Both parties had a role in this,\" said Joe Davis, spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars.\nA spokeswoman for Cassidy said the congressman was only referring to Senate inaction on the House measure in his statement. However, that isn\u2019t how his statement reads. If that were the case, it would mean that Senate Democrats had decided to take up the House bill after the scandal hit, which isn\u2019t true.\nOur ruling\nCassidy said that \"only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action.\" That\u2019s not accurate. Democrats tried to pass an expansive veterans\u2019 bill that included funding for the same 27 new clinics that Cassidy and the House passed last December. The bill was blocked by Senate Republicans, who were concerned about its funding and its scope. They also wanted to include sanctions against Iran.\nIt\u2019s fine for Cassidy to say Democrats bear some responsibility for not taking up the simpler House legislation, but it\u2019s incorrect for him to claim that it took the scandal to propel Democrats into efforts to pass a VA bill. That\u2019s revisionist history, so we rate Cassidy\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07735"}
