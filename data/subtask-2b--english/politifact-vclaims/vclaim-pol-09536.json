Chris Christie, disputed the value of comparing rates. He said the state looks at a business survey to get a broader picture of unemployment, while the BLS uses a monthly household survey to assess unemployment and determine the rate.\n\n\"What jobs were added, where were jobs added, in what sectors,\" Roberts said about the business survey. \"You can drill down and get a much better composite picture of what\u2019s happening in the state, rather than the unemployment rate.\"\n\nNow let\u2019s look at Buono\u2019s statement.\n\nThe national unemployment rate was 9.8 percent in February 2010. It briefly climbed to 9.9 percent but then trended downward, lingering at 9 percent for six months of 2011. By February of this year it had fallen to 7.7 percent. So Buono is right that the U.S. unemployment rate has declined steadily.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, is New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate nearly 2 percent higher than the nation\u2019s? It is, but only since about July 2012, according to BLS data.\n\nFinally, how does New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate stack up against Connecticut\u2019s and New York\u2019s?\n\nBuono for Governor spokesman David Turner said Buono\u2019s remarks cover the timeframe that Christie has been in office. Accordingly, we reviewed BLS data going back to February 2010 \u2013 Christie\u2019s first full month in office.\n\nBLS data shows that New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate was at least 1 percent higher than Connecticut\u2019s rate throughout 2012 and this past January.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate was 1 percent higher than New York\u2019s for a 22-month period from February 2010 to this past January.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of unemployment rates for the three states:\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s rate was 9.7 percent in February 2010 and 9.5 percent this past January.\n\nConnecticut\u2019s was 9.2 percent in February 2010 and 8.1 percent in January.\n\nNew York\u2019s was 8.1 percent in February 2010 and 8.4 percent in January.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn response to unemployment numbers released in January by the state Department of Labor, Buono said, \"While the United States has seen its unemployment rate steadily decline, New Jersey\u2019s remains nearly two percent higher than the national average and more than a point higher than Connecticut and New York.\"\n\nBuono has varying degrees of accuracy on her three points, looking strictly at unemployment rate: the national unemployment rate has declined steadily while Christie\u2019s been governor; the country\u2019s unemployment rate has been nearly 2 percent below New Jersey\u2019s, but only for about six months; and New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate has been more than 1 percent higher than New York\u2019s and Connecticut\u2019s for the bulk of the time Christie has been in office.\n\nGiven the varying degrees of accuracy, as well as the state measuring unemployment differently from the BLS, we rate Buono\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09536"}
