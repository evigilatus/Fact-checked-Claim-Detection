Marco Rubio said his parents 'came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover' of Cuba", "text": "U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio sold his American success story as he stumped across Florida two years ago.\nHis parents left Havana in 1959, he told a Panhandle audience, in search of a better life.\nHe told a\u00a0Tampa Bay TV\u00a0station, a\u00a0Fox Business\u00a0host and Sean Hannity on\u00a0Fox News\u00a0that his parents came from Cuba at the end of the 1950s \u2014 when dictator Fulgencio Batista fled Fidel Castro's revolution. \"In 1959,\" he told Fox 13 and Fox Business. \"In '58, '59,\" he told Fox News.\nBy Oct. 21, 2011, the biography on his\u00a0U.S. Senate website\u00a0still declared his parents \"came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover.\"\nBut\u00a0interviews,\u00a0documents\u00a0and\u00a0news\u00a0articles\u00a0in September and October raised doubts.\nPolitiFact Florida wanted to know: Did Rubio's parents come to America \"following Fidel Castro's takeover\"?\nDoubt\nAn Oct. 19, 2011, story by the\u00a0St. Petersburg Times\u00a0said naturalization records showed Rubio's parents,\u00a0Mario\u00a0and\u00a0Oriales, became U.S. residents in May 1956.\u00a0\nAt that time, Castro lived in Mexico after a failed 1953 attack on army barracks in Santiago de Cuba. Cubans lived under the dictatorship of Batista, who had seized power as he ran for re-election in 1952.\u00a0The nation,\u00a0which enjoyed high literacy, a strong educational system \u2014 even the world's fifth-highest number of TVs per capita \u2014 found itself ruled by decree.\u00a0\nIn May 1956, the Rubio family would fly to the United States. Castro returned to mount his revolution in December. More than two years would pass before Batista fled on Jan. 1, 1959.\u00a0\nIn 2006, Rubio, the young soon-to-be speaker of the Florida House, would\u00a0recount the takeover: \"In January of 1959, a thug named Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, and countless Cubans were forced to flee.\"\nTo many, he seemed to count his own family among them.\nAnd in 2009 and 2010, he told reporters dates that made that possible. News stories called the lawmaker, himself born in the United States in 1971, the son of \"exiles from Castro's Cuba.\" Some used a specific date: 1959.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory shift\nIn September 2011, Rubio chatted with Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo for\u00a0a story about his upcoming autobiography. They talked about Rubio's parents' immigration from Cuba. Caputo, later recounting his notes, said Rubio \"struggled to recall the year ... and said it was in ' '57 or '58 or '59.' \"\n\"When asked pointedly: Was it before the revolution? Rubio said it was before the revolution,\" Caputo wrote in an Oct. 20 blog post.\nCaputo included the detail in his September story, saying Rubio was, \"the son of Cuban immigrants who left Cuba just before the 1959 revolution.\"\nWhen we searched for news references to Rubio's parents, we found the new account differed from dozens of articles about Rubio's past, his own TV interviews, and his official\u00a0campaign\u00a0and\u00a0Senate\u00a0bios.\nAnd Rubio's bio didn't change.\nAfter the Times and the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0wrote about the discrepancy, Rubio\u00a0released a statement.\n\"The dates I have given regarding my family\u2019s history have always been based on my parents\u2019 recollections of events that occurred over 55 years ago and which were relayed to me by them more than two decades after they happened,\" he wrote on Oct. 20. \"I was not made aware of the exact dates until very recently.\"\nAsked about Rubio's official bio the next day, spokesman Alex Conant confirmed, \"the dates were wrong.\"\n\"We just recently became aware of it, and it just hadn't been updated,\" he said. (The site updated the evening of Oct. 21, 2011 to say: \"Marco was born in Miami in 1971 to Cuban exiles who first arrived in the United States in 1956.\")\nRubio learned the full story talking with his mom, Conant said, and looking at his parents' passports. (His father died in September 2010.)\nInstead of fleeing Castro's Cuba, the Rubios came to the United States for \"economic opportunity,\" Conant said.\nOur ruling\nSeveral times during his race for U.S. Senate, Rubio told reporters and voters his parents left Cuba in 1959, suggesting they had fled Castro's rule. In his campaign bio, and later in his official Senate biography, he said his parents \"came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover.\"\nEven after he stumbled over dates with a Miami Herald reporter and acknowledged his parents left before the revolution, his official Web bio stayed the same. After two news organizations reported his parents moved to the United States in 1956,\u00a0his spokesman acknowledged that the bio was wrong. It was updated to say, \"Marco was born in Miami in 1971 to Cuban exiles who first arrived in the United States in 1956.\" That puts everyone in agreement: The original statement is False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/65ac0f9d-294e-4c82-b97b-173ab4305c5d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12216"}
