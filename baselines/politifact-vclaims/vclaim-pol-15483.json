But after the last two, in 1991 and 2001, unemployment rates continued to climb for more than a year.\n\n\nInterestingly, Democrats criticized President George W. Bush regarding the 2001 \"jobless recovery,\" much as some Republicans now criticize Obama for the current one.\n\n\nThe latest jobless recovery came as little surprise to economists who study such trends.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Employers are hesitant to hire people back to the work force (after a recession) because they don't know if the economy is going to continue to grow, which is understandable,\" Beach said.\n\n\nBut more importantly, he said, the American economy has become increasingly reliant on service jobs, such as information and financial jobs. \"Those jobs come back very slowly,\" Beach said.\n\n\nThe recession this time is even more severe, so Beach predicts this jobless recovery will last even longer than past recessions.\n\n\n\"I don't think we'll see jobs coming back for a long time,\" Beach said.\n\n\nBut even without government meddling, Beach believes employment was destined to lag.\n\n\nThe\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle\n\n, relying on numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in August charted the lag between recessions' end and the peak of unemployment rates. In the eight recessions between 1949 and 1991, unemployment rates lagged by an average of about three months. After the last two, however, it took 15 months and 19 months, respectively, before unemployment rates peaked.\n\n\nBottom line, President Obama is right when he cautions that employment has lagged behind economic recovery in the past.
