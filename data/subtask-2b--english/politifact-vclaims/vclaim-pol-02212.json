USDA told PolitiFact it has no plans to require microchipping to receive program benefits.\nFacebook users flagged Anti News Network\u2019s post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat misinformation.\nAnti News Network\u2019s story includes accurate information about a software and breakroom kiosks company in Wisconsin, Three Square Market, which offered its employees the ability to get a microchip under their skin.

Instead, the story raises concerns about microchipping and calls on Americans to be vigilant.\n\"But regardless of how good the intentions may be, there are still a lot of questions that must be answered before the people of our country and elsewhere embrace the use of surgically implanted microchips. \u2026 If Americans are serious about holding on to our Fourth Amendment right to privacy, then these are questions that we should all demand be answered before more advancements in microchip technology are made,\" the post said.\nIt\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve fact-checked claims about governments microchipping their citizenry.
