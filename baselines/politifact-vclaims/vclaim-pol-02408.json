The article also\u00a0refers to Millian as being Russian, but he\u2019s Belarusian. The name \"Sergei Millian\" is not listed at all in the list of passengers who were boarded on the plane. The story offered an unsourced photo of passengers' names who were on the aircraft with Panchenko highlighted.\nAlso killed off in this story is Ivanov Vyacheslav, who is credited with being the CFO of nuclear energy corporation Rosatom, the company at the center of the Uranium One deal. That deal involved the sale of a Canadian company with mining interests in the United States to Russia\u2019s nuclear energy agency.\nVyacheslav did hold the CFO position at Rosatom until 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. According to the company website, the current CFO is Nikolay Soloman.\nThis Ivanov Vyacheslav was not on the plane, but a different man by the name was. The man killed in the plane crash was born in 1986,\u00a0Snopes reported, whereas the former Rosatom CFO began studying for his degree in 1987.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nA fake news site said that two Russian officials had died in a\u00a0plane crash. While the list of victims contained names that matched those of the two officials, they were not the same people.\u00a0\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-14 17:14:50 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Russian source behind fake Trump dossier killed in Russian plane crash, Rosatom CFO also dead\"    Puppet String News Bloggers    in a fake news blog post  Sunday, February 11, 2018 2018-02-11    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02408"}
