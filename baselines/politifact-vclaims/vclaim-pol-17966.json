The more than 1,000 comments include many expressing shock and disgust, while others wondered if the image is legitimate. One comment we saw suggested it had been doctored to inflame racial tensions.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

And is the description accurate to attribute it to a Wisconsin youth camp brochure?\nTime for a disgraceful history lesson.\nIt\u2019s an ugly topic, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s important to examine to both understand the long-running nature and impact of systemic racism \u2014 even through childhood games \u2014 and to acknowledge how the mindset behind it lingers today.\u00a0\n\"We can use the past to inform how we got to where we are, and then use that as a tool to educate us about the challenges we continue to face,\" said Reggie Jackson, historian and head griot, or storyteller, at America\u2019s Black Holocaust Museum, located in Milwaukee. \"As we do build toward racial repair and reconciliation, these are some of the things we need to be aware of that we\u2019re fighting against, those mindsets that are still way more common than they need to be.\"\nPicture from YMCA brochure\nThe picture is real \u2014 and it comes from the cited YMCA brochure.\nThe text of the Facebook post is actually a direct quote (without attribution) from a 2018 factcheck by Snopes.com, which rated True a claim that a game by that name was once a popular fairground attraction.\nThe game went by the name on the banner, as well as \"African Dodger,\" \"The Black Dodger\" and an array of other labels we won\u2019t repeat here. Participants got three throws with a ball or egg to try to hit a target.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes that target was a picture or model of a Black man, but often it was a real person, hired to play the role of the \"dodger.\"\nThe game was highlighted in the 1942 brochure for Camp Minikani, a camp in Washington County owned then and now by the YMCA of Greater Milwaukee. The camp was established in 1919 and remains in use.\nThe four-page brochure is on display at the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia in Michigan, and was included in the 2019 book \"Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the rise of Jim Crow.\" The game is featured on the brochure\u2019s last page, which promotes \"Special Events\" such as an all-camp carnival.\nCarrie Wall, president and CEO of the Milwaukee YMCA, called it \"a part of our history that we are not proud of.\"\n\"The image of this cruel \u2018game\u2019 horrifies and disgusts us,\" Wall said in a statement. \"As an organization, we are committed to diversity, inclusion, and equity for all. We can\u2019t hide from our past, but only pledge to be better every day since.\"\nViolent, racist carnival game was commonplace\nThe question from today\u2019s perspective is how a game in this vein could be so normalized.\nAn article on the game on the Jim Crow Museum website said it was \"as commonplace in local fairs, carnivals and circuses as Ferris wheels and roller coasters are today.\" Newspaper clippings showed it in use at events hosted by churches and schools.\n\"The idea that African Americans were sub-humans was prevalent and widely accepted,\" said the article, by museum multimedia specialist Franklin Hughes.\u00a0\nPop culture was rife with mentions of the game. A video compilation from the Jim Crow Museum shows clips featuring Popeye the Sailor (1933) and Donald Duck (no date) playing versions of the game, and it was the central theme of a 1931 movie called \"The African Dodger.\"\nDepartment stores even sold an at-home table version of the game.\nNewspapers from the early 1900s often mentioned the game. Some advertised for \"dodgers\" to play the role of target, and one account detailed a man hospitalized after participants brought their own weighted balls to use.\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook post says a picture of white boys playing a racist carnival game comes from a 1942 brochure for a Milwaukee-area YMCA camp.\nMuseum archives and other research confirms the picture is authentic and comes from a brochure for Camp Minikani.\nThe barbaric game was widely played from the 1800s into the mid-1900s, prevalent at all manner of fairs and carnivals, as well as in the media of the time.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17966"}
