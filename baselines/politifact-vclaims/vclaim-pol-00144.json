And she\u2019s repeatedly found herself at odds with the facts.\nIn May 2017, Clinton claimed that 200,000 Wisconsinites \"were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote.\" We rated that Mostly False.\nIn March 2019, she then claimed that \"somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls (in 2016) because of the color of their skin\" and other factors. That was even farther from the truth and drew a Pants on Fire rating.\nClinton returned to the topic again Sept. 17, 2019, in a speech at George Washington University. She listed reasons \"you can win the popular vote and you can lose the Electoral College,\" starting with what she called voter suppression.\n\"Experts estimate that anywhere from 27,000 to 200,000 Wisconsin citizen voters, predominantly in Milwaukee, were turned away from the polls,\" Clinton said. \"That\u2019s a lot of potential voters. They showed up, but maybe they didn\u2019t have the correct form of identification. Maybe the name on their driver\u2019s license included a middle name or an initial that wasn\u2019t on their voter registration. But officials made every excuse in the book to prevent certain people from voting in that election.\"\nThat\u2019s a lot of people to be \"turned away\" from polling places.\nSo let\u2019s recap this. Again.\nSpoiler alert: Clinton\u2019s numbers still aren\u2019t anywhere close to accurate.\nWhat the studies said\nClinton\u2019s team didn\u2019t respond to our request for evidence, but the vastly different numbers she cites \u2014 27,000 and 200,000 \u2014 roughly reflect two analyses that examined voter ID impact in the 2016 election.\nEven the low end of that range, if true, could have made a huge difference. Clinton lost Wisconsin by about 22,000 votes out of about 2.8 million cast. Wisconsin flipped to the Republican side \u2014 a key reason Trump won the election.\nA May 2017 report commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama, looked at changes in voter turnout and connected them to changes in voter ID law. They said turnout increased by 1.3% from 2012 to 2016 in states with no change to voter ID laws, but dropped in Wisconsin by 3.3%.\nIf Wisconsin\u2019s turnout had instead risen by 1.3%, Priorities USA estimated that would generate 200,000 more votes. The analysis called these the \"theoretical 200,000 lost voters.\"\nBut that\u2019s very different than tallying specific people \"turned away\" from the polls, as Clinton claimed.\nIn any case, the 200,000 has its own problems. Experts we\u2019ve quoted in past fact checks said it\u2019s not reasonable to attribute all the changes in turnout to the voter ID law when general enthusiasm \u2014 including for Clinton\u2019s candidacy \u2014 and other factors doubtless played a role.\nThe University of Wisconsin conducted a study that could be what Clinton relied on for the low end of the range. It involved a survey of 293 registered voters who didn\u2019t vote in Dane and Milwaukee counties in the 2016 election.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study estimated a total 12,000 registrants were affected by the ID requirement in those two counties.\nBut its findings don\u2019t at all match how Clinton phrased her claim, according to the author.\n\"Our measure captures people who both say they were turned away but also people who didn\u2019t even bother because they didn\u2019t think they could vote,\" Kenneth R. Mayer, a professor of American Politics at UW told PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"Our estimate is that it\u2019s plausible to think that the voter ID law reduced overall turnout somewhere in the range of 1% in these counties, but that doesn\u2019t get you anywhere close to (Clinton\u2019s) numbers.\"\u00a0\nA news release announcing the study also noted most of the respondents who said they did not vote because they lacked ID \"actually possessed a qualifying form of ID.\" That makes it even more ridiculous to group those people into the \"turned away\" category as Clinton did, since they would not in fact have been turned away based on ID if they went to the polls.\nHow many were really \u2018turned away\u2019?\nMayer said he saw anecdotal reports of people being turned away, and the UW study asked people if that happened to them.\nThe study reported 1.4% of those surveyed said they were told at a polling place their ID was inadequate. That would be four out of the 293.\n\"It was small enough that we regarded it as not material to the overall conclusion,\" Mayer said.\nFirmer numbers are hard to come by.\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission reported 821 ID-related provisional ballots were cast statewide in the 2016 election. Those are people who showed up without proper ID but cast a vote anyhow. If the person follows up to provide the correct ID by the Friday following the election, the ballot then counts.\nNot everyone who showed up without ID would cast such a ballot, of course. But it\u2019s one measure of how often ID issues surfaced at the polls.\nMayer said we simply don\u2019t know how many people were turned away. But he said Clinton\u2019s number isn\u2019t realistic.\n\"There is no possibility that (200,000) happened, because that would have been on the order of 60 people per polling place,\" he said, referencing the state\u2019s roughly 3,500 polling locations.\nWill Flanders, research director at the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, has criticized the UW survey for having a small sample size and focusing only on Democratic strongholds, among other elements. He said that makes Clinton\u2019s exaggeration of the study\u2019s findings even more extreme.\n\"Given the problematic nature of that (UW) estimate, estimates that are larger than that are even more out of the realm of reasonable possibility,\" Flanders told PolitiFact Wisconsin.\nOur ruling\nClinton said between 27,000 and 200,000 Wisconsinites were \"turned away\" from the polls in 2016 due to lack of proper identification.\nBut studies examining voter ID here say nothing of the sort.\nThey looked broadly at how voter turnout changed \u2014 which includes the far larger number who simply stayed away. Experts say there is no reliable number for how many were physically turned away, but the existing work leaves no doubt it\u2019s far short of the range cited by Clinton.\nThis is the third time we have rated claims from Clinton on the Wisconsin turnout. She\u2019s no closer on this one than the last one.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00144"}
