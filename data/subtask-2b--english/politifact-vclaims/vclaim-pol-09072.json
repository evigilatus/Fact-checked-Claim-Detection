Did you know that in the capital city of Providence \"it's illegal to sell toothpaste and a toothbrush to the same customer on a Sunday\"?\nNeither did we.\nBut that's what we were told in a July 14 feature titled \"11 Awesome Facts You Never Knew About Rhode Island,\" listed on the popular news and entertainment website BuzzFeed.\nHere at PolitiFact, we had two questions.\nFirst: Is that really true?\nSecond: Who thinks the inability to buy a toothbrush and toothpaste together on a Sunday is awesome?\nFor the uninitiated, BuzzFeed, \u00a0which regards itself as a legitimate news website, is always trying to take a hot topic and make it hotter. BuzzFeed loves lists. Its July 19, 2013 home page featured \"The 33 Fluffiest Animals On The Planet,\" \"38 Things Catholic Girls Love\" (#7 is \"Pancakes.\" No explanation is offered), and \"14 Not-At-All Gratuitous Breast Ads (Note to BuzzFeed: They ARE gratuitous).\"\nWe had our doubts about some of the other items on the Rhode Island list. (For example, we couldn't find any reference in state law to BuzzFeed's contention that \"It is illegal to throw pickle juice on a trolley in Rhode Island.\")\nWe decided to focus on the toothbrush claim because we don't want Providence residents to be at a disadvantage when it comes to dental hygiene.\nWe emailed BuzzFeed and asked for its source.\nWe also checked Rhode Island law to see if there was a toothpaste-toothbrush statute that applied to Providence (or any community). We came up with nothing.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also checked the online version of Providence's city ordinances. We found nada.\nThen we called Providence City Hall and spoke to Deputy City Clerk Lori Hagen, who indulged us and did her own check. She found zip. The ordinances don't contain any derivative of the word \"tooth.\"\nIf it existed, \"it would be in the code of ordinances,\" Hagen said, adding that she's never heard of any such restriction. She's worked for the city for 24 years.\nWe thought it might be an old ordinance, repealed long ago. City Archivist Paul Campbell came up with bupkis. \u00a0\nWhen we heard back from BuzzFeed, spokeswoman Augusta Mellon said in an email that a Google search for \"sell toothbrush toothpaste sunday rhode island\" produced over 8 million hits. (We checked that claim as well. Actual number of hits: about 650, and some of those didn't even refer to the \"law.\")\nMellon said, \"There's multiple accredited sources that have written about it, including the Brown Daily Herald and the Telegraph\" in Australia.\nThe unnamed blogger for the Herald, Brown University's student newspaper, reported buying both items at a local CVS, insisted that the prohibition was real, and treated the purchase like an act of civil disobedience. The blogger's source turned out to be a list at DumbLaws.com, which cites no actual law, past or present.\nAt least the Telegraph story begins: \"Here is a list of the world's most ridiculous laws or urban myths - we\u2019re not quite sure.\"\nBuzzFeed's Mellon ended her email by saying, \"It seems like it's a commonly referenced piece of information.\"\nShe should have added, \"Which nobody ever checks.\"\nSo oral hygiene fans can breathe a minty-fresh sigh of relief. A toothbrush and toothpaste can legally be purchased together any Sunday in Providence.\nMaybe someday this PolitiFact item will be part of a BuzzFeed list titled \"217 Examples of How BuzzFeed Didn't Check Its Facts.\" It'll be a hot one because we give the website a Pants on Fire!\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09072"}
