Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa, and the underlying bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Here\u2019s how the data stacks up.\n\n\u2022 One poll was done by CBS News and the New York Times. The survey, conducted Jan. 11-15, 2013, found that 85 percent of those living in a household with an NRA member favored background checks for all potential gun buyers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 The other survey, by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, was taken Feb. 13-18, 2013. It found that \"people in NRA households overwhelmingly favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks: 74 percent favor this proposal while just 26 percent are opposed.\"\n\nThese results verify that rank-and-file NRA members and those who live with them favor universal background checks by margins of between 74 percent and 85 percent.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a problem with Obama\u2019s phrasing. He said that a \"wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation.\" While the percentages supporting universal background checks in the latter two polls qualify as a \"wide majority\" in our book, each of these polls were taken before either of the two relevant pieces of legislation were filed in the Senate. Reid\u2019s underlying bill was submitted on March 21, while the Manchin-Toomey amendment was submitted on April 11.\n\nSo while the polls do demonstrate strong support for background checks -- a key element of both Senate measures -- it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to say that NRA members polled supported \"this legislation.\" The legislation in question hadn\u2019t even been introduced yet.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said a \"wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation.\" Two fully independent polls showed that NRA members or households support expanded background checks, but the polls couldn\u2019t have asked about the \"legislation\" Obama referred to because those measures had not been introduced yet.
