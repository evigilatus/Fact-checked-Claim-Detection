Jim Doyle, throw Wisconsin for a six-digit jobs loss?\nAs backup for the jobs claim, the RGA spot cites a very familiar source: A September 2013 item from PolitiFact Wisconsin.\nBut in that item, we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that Doyle\u2019s policies cost the state 133,000 jobs in his second term, from 2007 through 2010.\nWalker, we noted, got the number right. But experts said the national economic crash had far more to do with Wisconsin\u2019s job losses during that period than any state policies. Indeed, Wisconsin actually fared somewhat better than the rest of the country.\nThe claim in the RGA ad carries a subtle, but important difference.\nIt does not mention Doyle\u2019s second term as its timeframe. Rather, it makes an open-ended statement that those watching from their couch may likely hear as referring to Doyle\u2019s full tenure in office.\nBeyond that, Burke worked for Doyle as Commerce secretary over parts of both his terms, but not nearly for the entire eight-year period. She started in February 2005, about halfway through Doyle\u2019s first term, and left in November 2007 -- 10 \u00a0months into Doyle\u2019s second term.\nAnd the private-sector jobs picture changes dramatically if you look at Doyle\u2019s full tenure or narrowly at Burke\u2019s time as Commerce chief.\nWe ran the numbers using US Bureau of Labor Statistics quarterly census of employment and wages data, considered the most accurate measurement:\n-- Burke\u2019s state tenure: Gain of more than 55,000 jobs.\n-- Doyle\u2019s full eight-year tenure: Loss of 47,413 jobs (gain of 86,530 in term one, loss of 133,943 in term two).\nTo expand our analysis, we looked at two other scenarios:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- Start of Burke\u2019s tenure to end of Doyle\u2019s: loss of 77,267.\n-- Start of Doyle\u2019s tenure to end of Burke\u2019s: gain of at least 94,000.\nIt\u2019s apparent from these figures that the RGA ad cherrypicks the worst outcome for Burke by ignoring numbers from nearly two years she worked in Doyle\u2019s first term -- even though that represented the majority of her time in state government.\nIndeed, the state\u2019s private sector employment actually grew during Burke\u2019s specific \u00a0time as Commerce secretary. (Data note: because of limitations stemming from how the data is reported, we had to slightly adjust the time frames covering Burke\u2019s state tenure. But those adjustments do not alter the trends we found.)\nThere\u2019s something for the RGA to hang on to here, though, in that Burke was a holdover member of Doyle\u2019s administration for a small part of a second term during which more than 130,000 jobs were lost in four years.\nRGA spokesman Jon Thompson defended the 130,000 figure, saying Burke had a hand in Doyle\u2019s second term, but added that it is a \"fair comparison\" for others to look at all eight years of Doyle\u2019s record.\n\"Wisconsin is still worse off when all is said and done, and has turned that corner under Walker,\" he said.\nBlame game\nThe historical backdrop here is that until mid-2008, employment in Wisconsin was rising, as it had for years.\nIn June 2008, seven months after Burke departed, the total employment count started a big slide that was part of the Great Recession that swept the United States. The slide ended in mid-2010, in Doyle\u2019s final year, and the monthly gains that started then have generally continued under Walker.\nIn reality, neither Walker nor Burke deserve much of the credit or blame for job trends, particularly ones driven by an event as sharp as the Great Recession, economists have told us repeatedly. No governor -- much less a department head -- has much influence on the state jobs picture in the face of strongly negative national economic trends, they said.\nTo be sure, Burke highlights the job gains during her time while skipping over the recession.\nThat omission earned her a Half True when in October of 2013 she picked an entirely different time frame and said her actions as Commerce secretary brought the state 84,000 more jobs than we have today.\nOur rating\nThe Republican Governors Association charged that \"Burke was a senior member of the Doyle administration that left Wisconsin with 130,000 fewer jobs.\"\nThere\u2019s an element of truth, but the ad ignores the critical fact that Burke also worked in half of Doyle\u2019s first term, when 86,000 jobs were gained. Employment also rose in the narrower time frame when Burke worked for Doyle over parts of his two terms.\nAnd in any event, the role of these two officials in those losses and gains is very limited, given national economic realities of the time.\nWe rate the ad\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08170"}
