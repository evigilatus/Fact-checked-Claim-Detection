The program would allow public school students who are bullied to transfer to other\u00a0 private schools with\u00a0discounted tuition.\n\"House Bill 7055 is another Tallahassee assault on our local public schools,\" the narrator says in a voiceover. \"Political insider Richard Corcoran has a plan to divert even more of our tax dollars to unaccountable private schools.\"\nWe wondered about this claim. Does Corcoran have a plan to \"divert tax dollars to unaccountable private schools?\" We found there is some truth to this claim, but getting there requires a lot more context.\n\u2018Richard Corcoran has a plan to divert even more of our tax dollars\u2019\nFlorida Education Association communications director Sharon Nesvig said that the the Legislature has repeatedly increased and expanded a 2001 program known as the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship. HB 7055 adds a new \"voucher\" for a similar program, the Hope Scholarship.\nHere\u2019s how those programs work:\nThe Florida Tax Credit Scholarship was established in 2001 under Gov. Jeb Bush in order to give scholarships to poor children to attend private schools. The program provides dollar-for-dollar income tax credits for corporations that give money to organizations that give the scholarships. The tax credit cap for the 2017-18 fiscal year is almost $700 million and has increased every fiscal year.\nThe Hope Scholarship is a voucher-like program that would be funded through motorists making voluntary contributions when they purchase cars. In return, car buyers would get a credit on the taxes they would normally have to pay on the purchases.\nTax credit opponents, including the Florida Education Association, argue that the money used on these credits would have been state revenue if the Legislature had not diverted it.\n\"Those tax dollars would have gone into general revenue and been available to fund our neighborhood schools and pay for the books, curriculum, equipment and programs our students desperately need,\" Nesvig said.\nThere is no way to know for certain that money would end up being spent on schools, but education experts agreed with the general idea.\nKevin G. Welner, the Director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado, said that the word \"diverted\" is \"just about the best word choice they could have used.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The tax payment is diverted from the state to a system that funds the private schools,\" he said.\nIt\u2019s important to note, though, that the programs create new revenue streams. They don\u2019t literally move money from traditional sources of public school revenue.\nWhat about those \u2018unaccountable\u2019 private schools\u2019?\nNesvig pointed to an Orlando Sentinel months-long investigation about Florida private schools that receive these scholarships. It found that some schools\u00a0\"hire teachers without college degrees, hold classes in aging strip malls and falsify fire-safety and health records.\u00a0\nExperts agreed there is a huge difference in oversight, transparency, and accountability between public schools to voucher-receiving private schools.\u00a0The schools do not have to hire teachers with state certification or college degrees, and they don\u2019t have to follow the state\u2019s academic standards.\nIn addition, local public schools and charter schools are evaluated every year and assigned labels based on tests and other evidence, but that accountability system does not apply to private schools that accept vouchers, however.\nBut the word \"unaccountable\" does not address all of the nuances of the situation. Although experts said they are largely ineffective, private schools that receive vouchers do have to conform to accountability laws.\n\"If the ad included a footnote saying that the schools are \u2018subject to weak and ineffective regulatory accountability,\u2019 they might lose the punch of the statement, but it would be on more solid footing than flat out saying that the schools are \u2018unaccountable.\u2019\" Welner said.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that there has been some legislation to fix this issue.\nIn response to the investigation, Florida lawmakers took steps to increase accountability. SB 1756 would require private school to employ teachers who hold a bachelor's degree or higher from a \"regionally or nationally accredited college or university in the United States or from a recognized college or university in another country.\"\nOur ruling\nThe FEA said that \"Richard Corcoran has a plan to divert even more of our tax dollars to unaccountable private schools.\"\nThis claim requires some explanation.\nThe plan for diverting dollars refers to the Legislature\u2019s decision to expand the state\u2019s Tax Credit Scholarship Program and the Hope Scholarship proposal, which is included in HB 7055. The bill does create a new funding stream, but it doesn\u2019t literally move money from traditional sources of public school revenue.\nAnd while there are some rules that govern private schools that receive vouchers, experts said there is a huge difference in oversight between those schools and public school.\nWith everything considered, we rated this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02421"}
