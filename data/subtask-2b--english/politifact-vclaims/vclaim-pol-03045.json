Scott Walker wants state taxpayers to dole out up to $250 million annually in incentives to Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn to lure a manufacturing plant to Wisconsin that he claims will generate $181 million in tax revenue.\n\nThink about that. Gov. Walker proposes we pay about $70 million more a year in incentives to a foreign corporation than will flow back to our state coffers. Does that sound like a good deal to you?\nSo is that really the deal: Taxpayers pay up to $250 million a year to get the manufacturing plant, but get back only $181 million a year in tax revenue?\nThis claim is essentially correct on the two numbers, but it leaves out a big part of the equation.\nThe deal\nTwo days before the blog post, Walker joined President Donald Trump and other officials at the White House to announce\u00a0that Foxconn, after considering several other states, had decided to put the first liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturing facility in North America in Wisconsin. The displays would be made for computer screens, televisions and the dashboards of cars.\nWalker tweeted that the company, perhaps best known for making Apple\u2019s iPhone at factories in China, would be bringing 13,000 jobs to the state. We rated his claim Half True. Foxconn itself has said only that the plant will create 3,000 jobs, \"with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs.\"\nMuch hinges on the company\u2019s pledge to invest $10 billion, in exchange for $3 billion in incentives from the state.\nThe numbers\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo back its statement, One Wisconsin Now pointed us to reports from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that said the $3 billion in incentives could be doled out at a rate of $200 million to $250 million per year over 15 years; and that the state expects to collect $181 million in state and local tax revenue annually.\nBut it stands to reason the state wouldn\u2019t approve a losing deal without expecting something more.\nAnd that\u2019s what we heard from the economic and tax experts we talked to. They agreed that Walker is making the deal not only to get the Foxconn plant, but the many other businesses, jobs and related economic activity that is expected to be triggered by such a massive development.\nThe Walker administration estimates \"at least 22,000 indirect and induced jobs throughout the state\" and an economic impact of least a $7 billion per year. The massive development is expected to generate other new businesses, new housing and other economic activity that will, in turn, produce even more tax revenue.\n\"That\u2019s what the state is banking on,\" Marquette University economics professor Abdur Chowdhury said, referring to what some call the \"multiplier effect.\"\nWhether Foxconn follows through in full on its promises, and to what extent it will generate other economic development in Wisconsin, of course, remains to be seen.\nChowdhury cited Foxconn\u2019s promises in other places that didn\u2019t come to pass. And two other experts -- Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., and Steven Deller, interim director of the \u00a0Center for Community and Economic Development at the University of Wisconsin Extension -- told us they think estimates on the Foxconn multiplier effect are too rosy.\nBut whether Wisconsin is making a good deal isn\u2019t part of this fact check.\nOur rating\nOne Wisconsin Now says Walker \"wants state taxpayers to dole out up to $250 million annually in incentives\" to Foxconn \"to lure a manufacturing plant to Wisconsin that he claims will generate $181 million in tax revenue.\"\nWalker does want to offer $200 million to $250 million per year over 15 years in incentives in order to get Foxconn to put its plant in Wisconsin, and the estimate is that the project will produce $181 million per year in tax revenue.\nBut what\u2019s left out of the statement is that Walker and others are pursuing the deal in large part because the massive development is expected to generate other new businesses, new housing and other economic activity that will, in turn, produce even more tax revenue.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.
