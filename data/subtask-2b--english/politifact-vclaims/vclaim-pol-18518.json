But he added another detail that caught our eye.\n\"Across the state the rejection rate for ballots went way down because so much work and so much care was taken both by voters themselves and clerks around the state,\" Wikler said.\nIs his claim that the rejection rate for ballots is down correct? Let\u2019s take a look.\nThe claim\nWhen asked to back up the claim, Courtney Beyer, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Democratic Party of Wisconsin, cited a Oct. 28, 2020, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article that reported 23,196 absentee ballots were rejected in the April 2020 election, about 1.8% of total ballots. Democrats believe there are signs it would be much lower for the November election.\n\"At least 23,000 ballots were rejected in April,\" Beyer said in an email.\u00a0 \"We don\u2019t know exactly how many absentee ballots were rejected from this election (and won\u2019t for a while), but preliminary counts had it around 1,000. Significantly less.\"\nBeyer also cited a Nov. 3\u00a0 tweet from WisPolitics.com journalist Pat Poblete, who said \"Administrator Meagan Wolfe says as of this afternoon, 970 absentee ballots have been returned with a deficiency that would lead to them being rejected.\"\nBut Wikler\u2019s claim was made while discussing the Nov. 3 election. Viewers would have had no reason to believe he was referencing data from the April primary. So let\u2019s review what we know about absentee rejection Nov. 3.\nNo data yet for Nov. 3 election\nElections Commission public information officer Reid Magney said the jury is still out on the absentee rejection count.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We believe the numbers will be low, but we won\u2019t know the rejection rate for several weeks,\" he said. \"Clerks have 45 days (after the election) to enter that data into the statewide voter database.\"\nMagney said the 970 absentee ballots referenced as flagged \"was a preliminary, pre-election figure - ballots marked for rejection if the voters didn't fix problems.\" In other words, it doesn\u2019t give any general insight on how often ballots were rejected overall.\nHowever, there is an indication that the number of rejected absentee ballots could drop. The Oct. 28 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article points out that in April 2016, 5,860 absentee ballots were rejected \u2014 2.5% of the total absentee ballots.\nAnd in April 2020, 23,196\u00a0 absentee ballots were rejected. It\u2019s a much higher raw number, but because so many more people used absentee ballots it was actually a smaller portion of total ballots \u2014 1.8%.\nOur ruling\nWikler said, \"Across the state the rejection rate for ballots went way down.\"\u00a0\nAccording to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, it\u2019s too early to know how many ballots were rejected.\u00a0\nIt may very well be true that the absentee ballot rejection rate was lower than past elections, but for now, the commission says there is no data to confirm that. By looking at the 2016 rejected ballot rate compared with the improved April 2020 rate, there is a possibility the rejection will also be down for November 2020, but there is no data yet to confirm that.\nEven Democrats subsequently acknowledged, \"We don\u2019t know exactly how many absentee ballots were rejected from this election (and won\u2019t for a while).\"\nFor a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18518"}
