Bill Pascrell, medical bills have led about two-thirds of small businesses nationwide to close during the past five years.\n\nPascrell (D-8th Dist.) pointed to that startling statistic during a Feb. 1 debate in the House over a bill repealing the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or the CLASS Act. That Act was a provision of the health care reform law enacted in 2010.\n\nThe CLASS Act was meant to create a new insurance program for individuals to pay monthly premiums and later receive a cash benefit to support their long-term care needs. But before the program was implemented, federal officials canceled it in October 2011, pointing to legal and financial concerns.\n\n\"We have to find a way to make long-term care both accessible and affordable. These problems will not simply disappear. They're not going to go away,\" Pascrell told his colleagues. \"This bill certainly does not fix these problems. The bill does not even provide an alternative. All it does is attack the progress made in the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nPascrell added, \"Sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn't pay their health care bills, and you stand there with no alternative whatsoever.\"\n\nThat bill passed in a 267-159 vote, with Pascrell voting against it.\n\nBut PolitiFact New Jersey found it hard to believe that 62 percent of small businesses had closed during the past five years. After reaching out to Pascrell\u2019s spokesman, we found out why: the statement\u2019s not true.\n\nPascrell spokesman Paul Brubaker told us the congressman meant to say that \"62 percent of personal bankruptcies in 2007 were due to health care costs.\"\n\n\"He mistakenly said \u2018small businesses\u2019 instead of \u2018personal bankruptcies\u2019 and \u2018past five years\u2019 instead of \u2018five years ago,\u2019\" Brubaker added in an email. \"Congressman Pascrell stands by his overall point that personal bankruptcies have been demonstrably connected to health care costs.\"\n\nThat\u2019s good enough for the Truth-O-Meter. But let\u2019s explain the basis for the statistic that Pascrell was aiming for.\n\nTo back up the congressman\u2019s point, Brubaker directed us to a report published in 2009 in The American Journal of Medicine.\n\nFollowing a national study, researchers estimated in that report that illness or medical bills contributed to 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007 -- a significant jump from six years earlier. Many families were under-insured, leaving them responsible for large out-of-pocket costs, while others lost their private health insurance when they became too sick to work, according to the study.\n\n\"Since 2001, the proportion of all bankruptcies attributable to medical problems has increased by 50%,\" according to the report. \"Nearly two thirds of all bankruptcies are now linked to illness.\"\n\nAs for small businesses, their numbers have declined in recent years, but that reduction is much less than 62 percent.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Office of Advocacy, the number of small employers -- defined as having fewer than 500 employees -- dropped by about 4.2 percent from 6,004,056 in 2006 to 5,749,797 in 2009, which is the latest data available.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how much medical bills contributed to that reduction, but health care costs obviously remain a significant concern for small business owners.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a speech on the House floor, Pascrell claimed that \"sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn't pay their health care bills.\"\n\nBut his spokesman told us the congressman made a mistake and cited the wrong statistic. Pascrell meant to say health care costs led to 62 percent of personal bankruptcies five years ago.\n\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11555"}
