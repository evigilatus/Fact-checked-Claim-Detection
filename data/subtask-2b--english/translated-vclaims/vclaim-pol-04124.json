The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, and other Republicans, defended the election day process at the march of October 15, but Trump continued to blame the media for \"slamming Croak Hillary\" and added that manipulation was taking place in \"many polling places.\" \"There is, of course, a large-scale electoral fraud that takes place on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what's going on? So naive!\" The morning of October 17th, Trump regurgitated. Of course, large-scale voter fraud occurs on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what's going on? - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) on October 17, 2016, Trump's campaign repeated Trump's position that the cards were stacked against Trump, referring to a column from media correspondent Joe Concha in Tel about how the media could influence Trump's voter perceptions. To be clear, this is not the same thing as a voter committing fraud. The Trump campaign also referred to a 2012 study by the Pew Center that indicated that about 24 million people, one in eight, were no longer valid or inaccurate for voter registration in the United States. However, as mentioned earlier, no evidence of voter fraud has been found - this is about keeping poorly managed records in a state of chaos. Another evidence provided by the Trump campaign is a study conducted in 2014, according to which some 6.4 per cent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 per cent in 2010. This study was criticized by electoral experts for using an unreliable online database of respondents. Finally, the Trump campaign sent us reports of voting irregularities in swinging states such as Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia. However, these reports were reported and prevented fraud or isolated cases. It does not amount to widespread or widespread fraud or confirms that the few cases have affected the outcome of the elections. Voter fraud is rare. Trump's talking about him. He's not. Forging voters is not a catch-all term for any election fraud. Voter fraud is rare and refers to unlawful interference with voting, such as the filling of votes, the impersonation of voters, or the buying of votes. Before bidding for the White House, Trump quoted the murdered voters for handing over President Barack Obama's 2012 victory, making accusations about multiple voting in the pre-elections, and suggesting that undocumented migrants \"only walk and vote\" in some polling places. These charges do not reflect reality. New Zealand 21, a national investigation reporting project funded by the Carnegie Foundation in New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found 150 alleged cases of double voting, 56 cases of non-citizens voting and 10 cases of voter impersonation in all elections from 2000 to 2011. Many of these allegations did not lead to charges, while others were acquitted or dismissed. Justin Levitte, a professor at the Faculty of Law of Loyola and an expert on voter fraud, found fewer: 31 credible incidents out of over 1 billion votes were made between 2000 and 2014. Put it another way: more people are struck by lightning or are attacked more by sharks than are accused of fraud against voters. When voter fraud occurs, it is not always deliberate. Multiple studies have tracked known cases not to deliberate deception but to clerical errors or confusion. For example, the case of a dead person (Alan J. Mandel) occurred because one of the polling staff had accidentally marked his name instead of the man who had already voted, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in only one of five cases of non-citizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was informed that he was eligible, and the voter registration form was given by a staff member of the Department of Self-Defense when his licence was renewed. Therefore, given the scarcity of occurrence, lack of intent, and the federal penalty of $10,000 or even five years in prison, experts say that it would be extremely difficult to manipulate elections through the methods that Trump denounced. Facebook was published on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook video showing the man upset because he was added to the no-fly list to break into the Capitol. On January 11, 2021 I'd like to see him try to vote 10 times on election day. It would be practically impossible and a clich\u00e9 to try to sabotage the election \"Lorraine Mennet, Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University, who wrote the legend of voter fraud, and who told Polity Fuckett earlier. In order to vote twice or three times to influence the elections, an army of voters must visit multiple polling sites for each of them, know the names and addresses of persons who impersonate themselves and produce false identity cards (in many states) or fake their signatures - in addition to the obligation to witness false testimony at all times. \"Camps don't pay people to pretend they're not. Mary Francis Perry, former President of the United States Civil Rights Commission and author of $5 and a pork sandwich, said the book on electoral fraud. Therefore, there is no evidence of a massive attempt to falsify the elections on and before election day. Trump clarified the voter fraud theory a few hours after his first tweet. \"Paparazzi fraud! The repressed Hillary Clinton even asked questions for discussion, and nobody said a word. Can you imagine if you got the questions?\" He tweeted. Its follow-up does not constitute evidence of large-scale voter fraud, although it raises a separate concern identified by WikiLeaks. Trump refers to an e-mail that WikiLeaks received from the then CNN and Donna Brassell contributors to the Democratic Strategy. Brazil wrote to the Director of Communications at Clinton Jennifer Palmeri on March 12, 2016. \"Can Ohio and 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?\" Palmeri wrote again: \"Hello. Yeah, it's the one she's asking for. Not everyone likes her answer but can share it.\" The following day, CNN participated in the amendment of a democratic primary municipal hall, and a Clinton person asked about the death penalty. However, Brazil, which is now the interim Chairperson of the National Democratic Commission, denied that it had informed Clinton camp of the question and said that it had not been able to reach the questions in the first place. (The Clinton campaign has not yet confirmed or denied the authenticity of e-mails.) The CNN spokesman said: \"We have never given a question in the municipal hall to anyone in advance.\" The host of CNN Jake Taper, one of the moderators, called the leak \"very disturbing,\" and the network blamed the discussion partner TV one as a source. This is a matter of concern, but there is no evidence of voter fraud. Our Governor Trump said, \"Of course, there's a massive fraud of voters happening on and before election day.\" The actual cases of voter fraud - such as impersonation of voters, filling of votes and buying votes - are extremely rare, often unintended and not large enough to influence national elections. Once again, Trump &apos; s disturbing allegation has no evidence. We appreciate Trump's claim for pants on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/43048df5-6484-4ff3-b329.62f96846cd82 Correction: a previous version of this story wrongly described the current functional title of Joe Concha.
