The plan won passage in the House of Representatives, with almost all Republicans and no Democrats voted for it. But the Democrats made the risks of Ryan's changes to medical care a major point of discussion, seeking to blame the Republicans for whether they supported Ryan's vision. First of all, the Republican candidate for President Newt Jingerick has triggered a media storm to change his position on Ryan's plan. We assessed the position of Jingrich as complete. Now, Sean. Scott Brown -- the Republican who won a special election in 2010 to fill the long-held Massachusetts seat of the late Democratic Sin. Edward Kennedy -- According to Newburyport Daily News - a newspaper in northeast Massachusetts - Brown referred to Ryan &apos; s plan during an annual lunch at the Grand Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Newberryport on 13 May 2011. Brown said, \"The leaders will present Ryan's budget, and I will vote for it, and it will fail.\" Then the president will present his budget and you will fail. It's gonna be a great feed of ads.\" After 10 days, Brown wrote a newspaper article in the Politico political newspaper entitled \"Why don't I support Paul Ryan's medical care plan.\" \"while I commend Ryan for starting the conversation, I cannot support his specific plan - and so I will vote \"no\" on his budget,\" Brown wrote. A \"no\" vote on Ryan's plan is safer for Brown. The voters of Massachusetts have historically tended to be democratic, and the Republicans who win elections are usually moderate. Therefore, in his speech in Newport, Brown said that he would vote in favour of Ryan's plan, while in his opinion ten days later he said that he would vote against it. When we took these comments to the press in Brown, spokesman Colin Reed said: \"A point in Newport made clear that political games were playing in Washington, but it was not a comment on the merits of the bill.\" We agree that Brown &apos; s comment on Newport focuses on the budget-writing skill in Washington rather than on policy details. At the same time, Brown was keen in the Politico column to commend Ryan's role in initiating the \"discussion\" even when he declared his opposition to his plan. This suggests a rather delicate attitude. However, Brown in Newport clearly indicated that he would vote in favour of the plan, even if he expected that the vote would ultimately prove useless. Then 10 days later, in political opinion, he explained that he was not only disappointed with Ryan's plan, but that he would certainly vote \"no.\" Anyone who reads his comments in the Newport Daily News will be under Brown's impression voting for Ryan's budget, but it's not. So we're gonna give Brown a full push. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13055"}
