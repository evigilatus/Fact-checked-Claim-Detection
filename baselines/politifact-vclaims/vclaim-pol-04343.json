Doubled it. It\u2019s going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves,\" Trump told supporters at a Sept. 6 rally in Virginia Beach.\nDid Obama double the national debt? We checked.\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s press office justified his statement by sending us a link to U.S. Treasury Department figures on the size of the national debt.\nOn Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama took office, the total national debt stood at $10.6 trillion. On Sept. 6, the day Trump made his statement, it was $19.5 trillion.\nOver the past year the debt has grown by more than $1 trillion, so Trump\u2019s estimate that the debt will be \"close to $20 trillion\" by the time Obama\u2019s term ends in January is reasonable and is close to doubling the amount from when the president entered office.\nThese indebtedness figures take into account all obligations, including about $5.4 trillion in intergovernmental debt that the U.S. government owes itself, such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds that are invested in Treasury securities.\nWhen looking at the size of the U.S. debt, some experts prefer tallying just the amount of debt held by the public in Treasury bills, savings bonds and obligations to foreign governments, because that\u2019s the debt the government owes to outside entities.\nBut even by that measure, the debt has risen sharply. Public debt this month stands at $14.1 trillion, a figure that\u2019s more than double the $6.3 trillion total when Obama took office.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Trump\u2019s statement implies that Obama is solely to blame for the rise in the debt, and that misses a key part of the story.\nWhile Obama proposes spending and signs it into law, all of the spending bill first must pass Congress. In other words, the rise in the debt is not a solo act by Obama.\nOther factors beyond elected officials\u2019 actions contributed to the debt increase.\nRobert Bixby, executive director of the centrist Concord Coalition, told our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin in July that given the fact that Obama took office as the Great Recession sapped government revenues, the debt \"would have exploded certainly during (Obama\u2019s) first term, no matter who was president.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said Obama \"doubled the national debt. Doubled it. It\u2019s going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves.\"\nThe figures are correct, and we don\u2019t doubt the president shares some of the blame for the increased indebtedness. But Trump\u2019s statement leaves out some key points.\nFirst of all, the added debt wasn\u2019t solely the responsibility of Obama; Congress had to approve it as well. And the recession that began before Obama took office in 2009 cut government revenues and led to some of the higher debt incurred during the president\u2019s term.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04343"}
