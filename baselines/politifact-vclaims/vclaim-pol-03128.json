Chris Murphy, D-Conn., blamed President Donald Trump for insurance rate hikes through the administration\u2019s attempts to weaken the Affordable Care Act.\n\"It all started when he issued an executive order \u2026 that commanded all federal agencies to start undermining the ACA, and his agencies listened,\" Murphy said in the June 26 video. \"The IRS decided to stop enforcing the individual mandate that was the underpinning of the ACA. That has resulted in insurance companies all across the country jacking their rates up, explicitly because they don't believe that healthy people will buy insurance.\"\nInsurance rates have indeed been on the rise, but we wondered whether it could all be traced back to the IRS and a weakened enforcement of the individual mandate.\nWe found that Trump has continued the weak enforcement of the individual mandate in place during the Obama administration, freezing a change that was set to begin with the 2016 tax year.\nBut his party\u2019s rhetoric on repealing the Affordable Care Act, as well as other issues, have been linked to premium rate increases.\nThe role of the IRS\nThe IRS is the agency tasked with enforcing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, which requires most individuals to obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty for going without.\nThe mandate was designed to encourage healthy people to enter the risk pool and thus lower insurance costs.\nWhen people file their individual income tax returns, they must indicate their health insurance coverage or list a waiver or exemption. Otherwise, they must pay the penalty for lacking coverage. For the 2016 tax year, those who weren\u2019t covered had to pay 2.5 percent of taxable income or $695, whichever was higher.\nThose tax returns that failed to do any of these three actions were considered \"silent returns,\" and elicited a letter from the IRS alerting the taxpayer of the issue.\n\"Most of the time the taxpayer didn\u2019t get back, and there was nothing else the IRS could do,\" said Chris Condeluci, a former Republican tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee when the Affordable Care Act was written.\nPresident Barack Obama instructed the IRS to stop processing silent returns beginning with 2016 tax filings to punish taxpayers expecting a refund who failed to comply with the law.\nTrump\u2019s executive order scrapped that change.\n\"Processing silent returns means that taxpayer returns are not systematically rejected by the IRS at the time of filing, allowing the returns to be processed and minimizing burden on taxpayers, including those expecting a refund,\" the IRS said in a Feb. 15 press release. \"When the IRS has questions about a tax return, taxpayers may receive follow-up questions and correspondence at a future date, after the filing process is completed. This is similar to how we handled this in previous years, and this reflects the normal IRS post-filing compliance procedures that we follow.\"\nMurphy\u2019s team pointed us to that announcement when we asked for evidence for Murphy\u2019s statement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s order did cause the IRS to change direction internally, but outwardly, the agency is enforcing the same policy. \"They\u2019re adhering to the same enforcement policy as the Obama administration did. At the end of the day it\u2019s merely business as usual when it comes to the IRS,\" Condeluci added.\nThe IRS may have maintained the status quo, but the announcement still made an impact.\n\"It was noted by the actuaries who calculate rates. But it\u2019s another element in a complex mosaic in factors that lead to rate increases,\" said Dan Mendelson, the president of Avalere, a health care consulting firm.\nThen there\u2019s Congress.\nRegardless of the Trump administration\u2019s impact on the IRS, Congress is working to effectively scrap the individual mandate. The House Committee on Appropriations has drafted a bill that would terminate the tax penalty on those who go without insurance, which the House Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government approved on June 29.\nPremiums on the rise\nInsurance rates for the most popular type of exchange plan are an average of 18 percent higher than last year, according to Avalere. A combination of medical inflation and political volatility account for the hike, although it\u2019s hard to apportion the causes of the rate increases. The individual mandate isn\u2019t the only factor, though.\n\"Although the mandate is a reason for higher premiums for next year, it's probably not the main reason,\" said Sherry Glied, the dean of New York University\u2019s Graduate School of Public Service. \"The main reason is uncertainty about whether Congress will fund the ACA\u2019s cost-sharing reductions.\"\nThat's a different animal.\nCongress is weighing whether to continue funding the $8 billion pool of cost-sharing reduction subsidies under the ACA. In 2010, the House filed a lawsuit arguing the subsidies were illegal, and the Trump administration has not clarified whether it will defend them in court. The bipartisan budget bill passed late June did not include those funds.\n\"This is one of the larger premium hikes because there's a lot of uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen to the insurance marketplace,\" said Claire Brindis, the director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Whenever insurance companies feel like there's going to be dramatic changes, they get skittish about profit margins.\"\nOur ruling\nMurphy said that insurance companies are jacking up their rates because of the IRS\u2019 weakened enforcement of the individual mandate under Trump.\nThat\u2019s an exaggeration. The Trump administration has continued the same policies as Obama. A mandate to buy insurance is in place, but there\u2019s not much punishment for those who refused to comply.\nMurphy suggested that the individual mandate itself was key in keeping insurance rates low. In theory, the requirement invites greater diversity to the health insurance risk pool, but the IRS never had sufficient tools at its disposal to enforce it effectively.\nBlaming rate increases on the IRS is too simplistic, particularly as there is no evidence of a direct link. A number of other factors are at play, including uncertainty around future health care subsidies.\nBecause there has been little outward change in the IRS enforcement policies, we rate this statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-10 18:46:47 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Says because of Donald Trump, \"the IRS decided to stop enforcing the individual mandate that was the underpinning of the ACA.
