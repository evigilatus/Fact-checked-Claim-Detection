Andrew Cuomo signed it, Kearns, whose office oversees the Erie County Department of Motor Vehicles, claimed the law offers undocumented immigrants \"protections that US citizens don\u2019t receive.\"\u00a0\nWhen reached by phone, Kearns said he was referring to a section in the new law that requires motor vehicle commissioners to give\u00a0notice to an individual within three days in the event an immigration enforcement agency requests information about that individual.\u00a0\nDrivers whose information is requested by other law enforcement agencies do not get a three-day notice.\n\"There\u2019s a different standard,\" he said. \"That\u2019s a protection that I don\u2019t have now.\"\u00a0\nNew York lawmakers\u2019 decision to grant driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants has provoked a strong reaction from people who are opposed to the idea.\u00a0So we decided to look into Kearns\u2019 claim.\u00a0\nThe law\nThe Green Light Law allows undocumented immigrants to obtain standard (non-commercial) driver\u2019s licenses.\u00a0\nIt prevents DMV employees from turning over information to immigration enforcement agencies without a judicial warrant or court order. If a warrant or court order is received by the DMV, directing employees to hand over records or information about a driver to an immigration authority, DMV commissioners must notify the driver, regardless of the driver\u2019s immigration status, about the request within three days.\nKearns\u00a0claims that this notification is a special protection for undocumented drivers. While this provision may alert undocumented drivers that Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection agents are asking about them, one expert we spoke with noted that it could help everyone.\u00a0\nThere is a history of ICE wrongly targeting U.S. citizens for deportation, said Kendra Sena, senior staff attorney at the Government Law Center at Albany Law School.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, a man born in North Carolina, with no Mexican heritage, was wrongly deported to Mexico and eventually settled his case with the federal government. In 2013, Syracuse University published a study showing ICE had issued detainers, a notice that they planned to apprehend an individual, for 834 U.S. citizens and 28,489 legal permanent residents, in the previous four years. In the last two years, ICE\u2019s efforts to detain naturalized and native-born U.S. citizens have made headlines, including the case of a U.S. Marine born in Michigan.\nSena said the notice provision applies in the immigration context but not in others because the consequences of immigration action can be so severe.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe provision that provides notice to drivers who have caught the attention of immigration enforcement applies to every driver, regardless of their immigration status, said Fabien Levy, press secretary for the State Attorney General\u2019s Office.\u00a0\nUnder the law, the response by DMV to agencies requesting information does not change based on the immigration status of the driver, said Nicole Hallett, director of the Community Justice Clinic at the University at Buffalo School of Law.\u00a0\n\"There is no scenario in which an agency would make two requests for information, one regarding a citizen and one regarding an undocumented immigrant, and would be permitted to comply with the former but not the latter,\" Hallett said. \"The DMV would either be prohibited from complying in both or be permitted to comply in both depending on the identity of the agency.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\nKearns said that undocumented immigrants receive protections under the Green Light law that are not afforded to U.S. citizens.\u00a0\nUnder the law, if an immigration enforcement agency obtains a court order or judicial warrant to secure information about a driver,\u00a0the DMV must notify the driver within three days. This notification would happen regardless of whether the driver is in the country legally or not.\u00a0\nWhile this provision may help more undocumented drivers than those drivers with documentation, all are treated equally under this provision.\u00a0\nWe rate Kearns\u2019 statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00477"}
