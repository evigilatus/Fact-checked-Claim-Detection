This story was published by the Red State, a conservative political blog, on October 30, citing a Fox News journalist, who submitted a report from Mexico. The broadcast showed bus footage lined up while hundreds of Central American immigrants waited for them to ride. The convoy is one of three trips through Mexico involving thousands of people. According to the story of the Red State, the growing migrant convoy to the United States border was followed by \"disturbing reports of immigrants receiving State-funded assistance from Mexico.\" This report has been referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the story was partially accurate, but it lacked some basic details. On October 30, Fox News Reporter Griff Jenkins said it was the first time he saw \"an organized bus operation from Oaxaca actually get buses to put people on them and take them to their next location.\" The buses were intended for women and children, but many parents and husbands did not want to be separated from their families. Jenkins also said that while the Mexican police tried to dissuade the convoy from crossing the border between Guatemala and Mexico in mid-October, it appears that \"at least Mexican cities are really helping them to make their way now.\" One of the stories from the central region of the same day reported that migrants began arriving in Oaxaca that morning from Santiago Nellibek, a town about 30 miles south. For the first time, inform the port, the buses were \"used to transport women and children.\" On January 11, 2021, Facebook published in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021, many of the photos taken by Associated Press also show families and children on buses, with trips reportedly donated to help some families get to the next destination. Photos were taken on the morning of 30 October in Naltebek, Oaxaca. It is not known who paid for the donated deliveries. It is not clear whether those buses are the same as Jenkins, but time, history and the region match the numerous reports that families have taken donated buses to their next destination. In November 2, a Mexican governor offered to help the convoy with buses. Veracruz Goff Miguel Angel Yunus announced in a video that the state authorities would provide humanitarian assistance as well as buses to jump into the country's capital. But almost immediately afterwards, Yunus pulled the show in a second video, saying that since Mexico's water system was being maintained, it would not be right to send immigrants there. However, reports indicate that planned maintenance has been known for some time. It is reported that most migrants continued on foot and arrived in the Mexican capital during the weekend. It is unclear whether the Fox News buses she saw and reported on were the work of the Mexican Federal Government, but other reports from the same day and the region said that the buses were donated to some immigrant families to reach their next destination. At some point, a Mexican governor offered to transport migrants by bus to Mexico City, the next stop for the group at the time. However, that plan was withdrawn almost immediately thereafter. The story has some basis, but it does not provide readers with all the details or mention that multiple buses have been donated. We're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01279"}
