Here's what he says: \"Arkansas's policy is to protect the life of every unborn child from pregnancy to childbirth, to the extent permitted by the Federal Constitution.\" Hakabi's statement that the amendment says \"everything is possible in the world\" must be strictly limited to the term \"to the extent permitted by the Federal Constitution.\" At present, the decision \"Roe v. Wade\" means that the Federal Constitution permits abortion. The special Charlie Kirk, a fact checker, mentioned on January 26, 2021 at Instagram. \u2022 On January 28, 2012, it is also a slight exaggeration to say that the Arkansas Amendment declares that life begins at conception, although it certainly implies me. We would also like to note that he obtained the amendment number wrong. Amendment 68 deals with abortion. The amendment deals with 65 revenue bonds. :: Editor &apos; s note: This statement was estimated to be barely correct when it was published.
