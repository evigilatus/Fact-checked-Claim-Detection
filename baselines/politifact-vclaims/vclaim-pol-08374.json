In doing so, she became the first to take on first-term incumbent Commissioner Bob Terry.\nOregon Public Broadcasting contacted Terry to get his reaction to Furse\u2019s announcement. In a brief interview, the Fisher Farms nursery owner said the county already is heading in the right direction, noting that the reserve fund is healthy and that the county carries little to no debt.\nHe added this: \"And we\u2019ve constantly been the lowest unemployed county in the state.\" \u00a0That\u2019s impressive, if true. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check.\nWe called Nick Beleiciks, a state employment economist, who walked us through a website containing the annual average unemployment rates by county. The data go back to 1990. Before that, only statewide figures were tracked, Beleiciks said.\n\"Washington County had the lowest (or tied for the lowest) annual average unemployment rate in 1990, 2000, and 2006,\" he wrote in a follow-up email. \"Washington County generally has the third or fourth lowest unemployment rate among Oregon\u2019s counties. The county\u2019s worst rank for unemployment rate was 9th lowest in 2009.\"\nSo the county registered the lowest average annual unemployment rate in Oregon only three times in the past 23 years. The most recent figures, from November 2013, show Benton County\u2019s 5.7 percent rate as lowest in the state. Hood River is second at 5.7 percent, with Washington County third at 6 percent.\nWe called Terry to get his response.\n\"There are two ways of interpreting that,\" he said. \"When I was asked that question, I was thinking of the four-county region (Washington, Multnomah, Clackamas and Clark counties). Among those, it has consistently been the lowest. If you look at the entire state, which is what I actually did say, the proper word would be one of the lower. I\u2019ll be more careful about how I state that in the future.\"\nHe added, \"You need to look at the population bases of the counties we\u2019re talking about. None of them is anywhere near as big as we are. We are a leading contributor to the coffers of the state of Oregon.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington County has long touted its economic vitality, with good reason. It\u2019s home to some of the state\u2019s biggest and most successful businesses, such as Nike, Intel, Tektronix and Columbia Sportswear.\n\"Washington County does, in fact, have a very important place in Oregon\u2019s economy,\" said Tim Duy, senior director of the Oregon Economic Forum at the University of Oregon. \"Clearly, it has a large employment base with relatively high salaries.\"\nMark McMullen, Oregon state economist, told us that the county\u2019s computer and electronic producers alone account for more than 20 percent of overall Gross State Product, and the majority of GSP growth in recent years. Sliced another way, the county over the past four years has been responsible for one-third of all statewide wage and job gains, McMullen said.\nTerry is correct in talking about Washington County\u2019s large jobs base. Its 260,900 jobs as of November 2013 dwarf, say, Hood River County\u2019s 11,030 jobs.\nBut those figures, while impressive, don\u2019t support Terry\u2019s statement about Washington County \"constantly\" leading the state in low unemployment rates.\nStatewide, Washington County has ranked third behind Benton and Hood River counties since November 2012, according to state data. Even looking just at the four-county metro area, to which Terry said he should have limited his comments, Clackamas County has had a lower annual unemployment average than Washington County five times since 1990. Twice, in 1999 and 2002, the counties tied.\nTerry noted, in follow-up comments, that Washington County has had and continues to have a significant role in powering the state\u2019s economy. Two state economists and a wealth of data support that idea.\nBut his claim to OPB was that the county has \"constantly been the lowest unemployed county in the state.\" The county has led or tied for the lead in that category only three times in the past 23 years, though it has often had the third- or fourth-lowest rate.\nBy saying \"constantly,\" \"lowest\" and \"in the state,\" Terry left himself no wiggle room. The numbers don\u2019t bear out his initial claim. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08374"}
