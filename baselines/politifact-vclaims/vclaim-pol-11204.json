That\u2019s the theory.\n\n\"Ohio, we tested this theory,\" he continued. \"Take a look at what happened in Ohio between 2000 and 2008. It\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t try it. And instead of faster job growth, we had the slowest job growth in half a century. Instead of broad-based prosperity, the typical American family saw their incomes fall by about 6 percent. Outsourcing, rampant; phony financial profits all over the place. And instead of strengthening our economy, our entire financial system almost collapsed. We spent the last three and a half years cleaning up after that mess. \u00a0So their theory did not work out so well. Maybe they haven\u2019t been paying attention, but it didn\u2019t work out so well.\"\n\nThis passage includes a lot of claims, but the one we\u2019ll focus on here is whether \"the typical American family saw their incomes fall by about six percent\" during the time when Republican economic policies were in force.\n\nAs we typically do with claims of this sort, we\u2019ll look both at the accuracy of the numbers and the question of whether Obama has justification for blaming Republicans for the nation\u2019s economic challenges.\n\nChecking the number\n\nWe\u2019ll start by noting that Obama' remarks were confusing. He mentioned \"Ohio between 2000 and 2008,\" but then he spoke of the decline in the incomes of \"the typical American family,\" which would include families outside of Ohio. And the dates he used were mentioned three sentences before the decline in income he cited. Since that\u2019s all we had to go on, though, we began our analysis by looking at national data on family incomes between 2000 and 2008.\n\nWe looked at the most straightforward measurement that seemed to fit Obama\u2019s claim -- the median income for families, adjusted for inflation. This is one of the standard measurements taken by the Census Bureau every year.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the inflation-adjusted median income for families fell from $64,232 in 2000 to $62,299 in 2008, a decline of about 3 percent. That\u2019s half of the 6 percent figure Obama used.\n\nThe White House confirmed that it had used the same data set we did but said the 6 percent figure came by comparing the numbers between 2000 and 2010. Indeed, when we checked the math for those years, median family incomes declined by just under 6 percent.\n\nHowever, doing it this way is problematic.\n\nFirst, Obama didn\u2019t say 2000 to 2010; he said 2000 to 2008. The two additional years make a big difference, because 2009 and 2010 encompassed one of the weakest economic periods in recent American history.\n\nThe White House did point us to two speeches in which Obama accurately described the time period for the 6 percent statistic. However, we\u2019re not sold on the idea that using the period 2000-2010 bolsters his argument that Republican economic policies caused a 6 percent decline in median incomes.\n\nOn the one hand, you could argue that Democrats, who controlled the White House and Congress, bear some of the blame for the economic decline in 2009 and 2010. On the other hand, you can argue that Obama doesn\u2019t deserve the economic blame for 2009 and 2010 since the decline was shaped by the policies of his predecessor. But if you do, then it\u2019s not equitable to hold his predecessor, President George W. Bush, to a different standard. If you argue that the economic outcomes in 2009 and 2010 result from Republican policies, then being consistent requires attributing a share of the blame for what happened in 2000 and 2001 to the policies of Bush\u2019s predecessor, President Bill Clinton.\n\nAnd what happens if you make the calculation using the years 2002 to 2010 instead? It works out to a 3.6 percent decline -- still lower than the 6 percent the president cited.\n\nHow much does a president or a party deserve credit or blame for the economy?\n\nWe asked several economists of various ideological perspectives how much blame the GOP deserved for the recession that started in December 2007. None said the Republican Party deserved all of the blame, but none said the party deserved no blame at all, either. The consensus was that it was somewhere in the middle.\n\nDan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, said, \"I fully agree that Republicans deserve a lot of blame. But the reason the economy was anemic is that the burden of government spending almost doubled, the regulatory burden increased, and other statist policies were implemented.\"\n\nIn other words, in Mitchell\u2019s view, you could say the GOP deserved blame because they weren\u2019t staying true to the party\u2019s fiscally conservative, anti-regulatory rhetoric and were instead acting like stereotypical Democrats. (On a non partisan note, Mitchell praises a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, for offering economic policies that were superior to Bush\u2019s.)\n\nBarry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Carter administration, said it\u2019s \"fair to blame government for regulatory failures in the areas of housing and finance and the resulting financial crisis.\" He said the blame for that extends to both parties. \"I think the Republican philosophy of unfettered markets bears the greater blame, but Democrats also allowed excesses to develop in the housing market and were happy to take Wall Street\u2019s money,\" Bosworth said.\n\nSeveral of the experts we contacted emphasized that the U.S. government, while powerful, is not all-powerful.\n\n\"Republican policies certainly didn't help,\" said Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. \"But the fundamentals are technological and global forces.\"\n\n\"There was a worldwide credit bubble that led to a worldwide financial collapse that led to a global Great Recession,\" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"If you accept that observation, it becomes hard to blame anyone in the U.S. overly for the results.\"\n\nFoster added, \"The simple political narrative is to blame the other side. Fair enough to a point. \u00a0The party in power always gets too much blame and too much credit, depending on circumstances.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama has a point that incomes for the \"typical\" family have fallen since 2000 when adjusted for inflation. But using a time frame that treats Obama\u2019s tenure and Bush\u2019s tenure equally, the decline was about 3 percent, not the 6 percent he cited. Meanwhile, on Obama\u2019s larger point of blaming Republicans for the weak economy, we found a consensus that Obama is partly, but not completely, on defensible ground. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
