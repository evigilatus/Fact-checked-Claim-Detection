In this case, there is some truth to part of the statement, although the sentence that says food stamps \"will not be available\" in March is premature. The letter contained telephone numbers for the Delaware Food Bank. This organization has led us to find the same information in a brochure that directs people to a website of the Health and Social Services Agency in Delaware. A State agency spokesman directed Politi Fact to a news release, which did not predict anything about the benefits in March. \"Our hope is to return to the normal schedule starting in March,\" he says. The bulletin correctly stated that the beneficiaries of the programme would receive benefits for the month of February in January, as announced by the Federal Government last week. Defenders are concerned that recipients may not be aware of what is happening and spend the February benefits in January, and then run out of food. What happens to the food stamps in March? The Federal Ministry did not declare that the benefits would be interrupted in March if the closure continued. While the South Pacific National Action Programme benefits are considered to be a benefit, which means that any eligible person can receive benefits if an application is made, the programme is historically funded through the annual appropriation process, generally as part of the Agriculture Bill. Facebook, mentioned on January 11, 2021, in an article in Facebook by Nancy Belusi, is no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, Dottie Rosenbaum, an expert at the left-hand center of budget and policy priorities, told Polity Fuckett that she did not think many states could cover the cost of food stamps if the federal government did not fund the program. \"Even if they can, it's unclear how they'll get state ownership to do so in the middle of the year, and it's not clear whether they'll be able to pay after the truth,\" she said. \"U.S.A. didn't mention it.\" Ellen Waxman, an expert on food benefits at the Urban Institute, said he was guessing to anyone what would happen. But she thinks it's likely that the federal government will have to find a solution because the benefits of SNAP are an important part of the food economy. At the national level, some 39 million people receive the benefits of the South Pacific National Action Programme, with an average of $123 per month. Overall, the number of beneficiaries of food stamps has declined since 2013. In Delaware, more than 136,000 people receive food stamps, mostly children, older persons and persons with disabilities. James P. Zeljak, Director of the Centre for Poverty Research at Kentucky University, said that if the benefits of SNAP were lost, \"we would enter a largely unknown area since the start of the Modern Food Printing Programme in 1977.\" Some organizations, including the Delaware Food Bank, are preparing for a possible influx of visitors in the spring. Our Facebook article said: \"March 2019 and continuing food benefits will not be available until further notice. Clients are encouraged to use their food benefits as soon as possible if SNAP benefits are not available in March.\" The first part of that post is premature because it is not known whether the benefits of the programme, commonly referred to as food stamps, will be available in March. All we know is that during the closure of the federal government, food stamps continued until February. What happens next is anyone's guess. We're assessing this statement half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/05363e5e-ba42-40e3-80f2-264651534299", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01124"}
