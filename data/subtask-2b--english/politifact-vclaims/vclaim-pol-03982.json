He's wrong", "text": "Time after time, Donald Trump has complained that the media doesn\u2019t show show the magnitude of his crowds at rallies.\n\"I have to put up with some of the most dishonest people in the world \u2014 the media,\" Trump told a crowd in Pensacola, Fla. \"They never shows crowds like that \u2014 look at that, it goes all the way back. They never show crowds. They don't show crowds.\"\nWe wondered if the media really never showed Trump crowds, so we turned to the archives and a former CBS photojournalist to figure it out.\nThe coverage\nMost rally coverage shown on television focuses on the candidate speaking behind the podium, rather than showing the whole crowd. There\u2019s a reason for this.\nAt campaign events, one television network organization is responsible for controlling the head-on pool camera, and other cameras are responsible for wide shots and reaction\u00a0shots.\nLes Rose, a professor at Syracuse and former field producer and photojournalist for CBS, said whoever is working the head-on pool camera\u00a0is not working for the employer, but working for every television network or station in America.\u00a0\nOf course, local news stations and national stations bring their own camera equipment to cover the event, but\u00a0media outlets are dependent on the footage that is shot on these head-on pool cameras.\nThe cameraperson in charge of the head-on pool camera has a very specific goal: get a shot of the candidate walking onto the stage, a shot of the candidate walking off the stage and the candidate saying the speech.\n\"If (Trump\u2019s) looking strictly at that feed (from the head-on camera), then you\u2019re never going to see a crowd because that\u2019s not the gig,\" Rose said.\nThe reason news outlets often show the head-on pool footage is because the audio is the most clear in comparison to the other camera responsible for the reaction shots. Rose said the other cameras pick up natural sounds like applause that can make it harder to hear the actual speech.\nStill, this doesn\u2019t mean the media doesn\u2019t show crowds at Trump rallies. A quick Google search quickly debunked this.\nReporters have shown Trump\u2019s crowds through photos. \nSee examples here, here, here, here\u00a0and here.\nNews stories:\n\n\"More than 15,000 fired-up Donald Trump fans turned out Monday night to cheer on the presidential nominee heading into the final two weeks of the campaign,\" reads the lede of a story from the Tampa Bay Times from his Oct. 24 rally in Tampa.\n\"His supporters routinely pointed, as the nominee did, to the huge crowds still flocking to see him as evidence that his campaign remains strong,\" reads a line from a New York Times article from Trump\u2019s rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
