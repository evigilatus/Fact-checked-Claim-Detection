Ted Cruz, had never denied that his father was in a 1963 photo with Lee Harvey Oswald, who went on to assassinate President John F. Kennedy that November.\nAt a rally, Trump initially told supporters he doesn\u2019t want the backing of Cruz, whose convention speech two days earlier drew boos for not including a Trump endorsement; the Texan did offer congratulations.\u00a0Next, Trump resurrected his unconfirmed claim about Oswald and Rafael Cruz, the senator\u2019s father, possibly knowing one another.\nTrump said: \"All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the National Enquirer there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast. Now, Ted never denied that it was his father. Instead he said, \u2018Donald Trump.\u2019 I had nothing to do with it. This was a magazine that frankly, in many respects, should be very respected.\"\nIn May 2016, PolitiFact found incorrect and ridiculous--Pants on Fire--Trump\u2019s claim that Cruz\u2019s father was with Oswald before Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\nThere was no evidence\u00a0the man next to Oswald in the black-and-white photo published in the Enquirer was the elder Cruz. Notably, facial recognition experts advised that no such match could be made; meantime, historians found no corroborating records. The Enquirer never said how it determined the man in the photo with Oswald was Rafael Cruz.\nCould it still be that Sen. Cruz never denied his father was in the photo?\nTo our inquiry on this point, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out a statement the Cruz campaign gave to the McClatchy News Service in April 2016 at the time the photo in question was printed on the Enquirer\u2019s cover. \u00a0\nThe Cruz campaign\u2019s communications director, Alice Stewart, said then: \"The story is false; that is not Rafael in the picture,\"according to the Miami Herald\u2019s April 22, 2016 news story.\nStewart\u2019s \"not Rafael\" declaration appears to have gotten\u00a0play. We found it in stories or web posts on the McClatchy website and for the conservative web network The Blaze plus in the International Business Times, on the FactCheck.org fact-checking site and on sites for Yahoo! News, The Hill, Gawker, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump first cited the Enquirer article during a May 3, 2016, telephone interview with the Fox News program, Fox and Friends. Later that day, at an Indiana campaign event, Cruz spoke to reporters, saying: \"This morning Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Let\u2019s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position, this is just kooky.\"\nCruz said the Enquirer \"just spread lies, blatant lies\" and described the article as \"this idiotic story about JFK.\"\nAlso, \u00a0on May 3, 2016, Ben Jacobs, political reporter for the Guardian, tweeted a statement regarding the claim that Jacobs generally attributed to the Cruz campaign. It said: \"It\u2019s embarrassing that anyone would enable Trump to discuss this. It\u2019s a garbage story and clearly Donald wants to talk about garbage.\"\nThe same day, Rafael Cruz told ABC News in a TV interview that the links insinuated between him and Oswald were \"ludicrous.\"\n\"I was never in New Orleans at that time,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the day after the Republican convention that Cruz \"never denied\" his father was pictured with Oswald before Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\nThis spring, Cruz called the National Enquirer story \"lies.\" \u00a0Earlier, a\u00a0Cruz camp spokeswoman said outright\u00a0the elder Cruz wasn\u2019t in the published photo.\nThat's far enough\u00a0from \"never denied,\"\u00a0it makes Trump's claim incorrect and ridiculous.\u00a0Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\u00a0Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/71e05452-f360-4bcc-99aa-64c54477a3ec", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04623"}
