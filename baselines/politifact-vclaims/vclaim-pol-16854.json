Jeff Jackson has tried to keep his constituents informed by posting on social media.\nJackson, a Mecklenburg County Democrat, regularly tweets stats about the pandemic. And on March 19, he urged people to reschedule elective procedures to free up space for coronavirus patients.\n\"Hospitals are starting to cancel elective surgeries and doing their best to empty hospital beds to prepare for a surge. Our hospital beds are typically 85% full across the state. If we don't significantly reduce that number within the next week, that's a major problem,\" Jackson tweeted.\nIs it true that, under normal circumstances, hospitals operate at 85% capacity?\nWe couldn\u2019t find a supporting number. But we did learn that it\u2019s normal for NC hospitals to treat patients while their facilities are close to being full.\nAccustomed to high capacity\nWe reached out to Jackson about his tweet. He said he heard the figure from officials with North Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services. So we reached out to them.\nDHHS spokeswoman SarahLewis Peel responded by email, but didn\u2019t give an exact number.\n\"On any given day, our hospitals \u2014 by design \u2014 operate at 90 to 100% capacity. That\u2019s why we have sought waivers to allow critical access hospitals to operate above their licensed capacity,\" Peel wrote.\nDHHS later clarified that those numbers are usually during flu season and that evidence is anecdotal. It\u2019s from speaking with hospital managers and suppliers.\nDavid Weber, the associate chief medical officer at UNC Health, told NC Health News something similar. He said that, with the closure and downsizing of many rural hospitals, there are fewer beds overall across the state.\n\"The U.S., compared to years ago, has less open beds and on a normal busy week, you know, most of our hospitals, including UNC, would be running between 90 and 100% occupancy,\" he said.\nHowever, we need hard numbers -- not anecdotes -- to get the most accurate picture.\u00a0\u00a0\nOther estimates\nSo, what stats are available? The North Carolina Health Association had a lower estimate, but its latest figures are from 2018.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCynthia Charles, the association\u2019s vice president for communications, pointed to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2015, the average US hospital occupancy rate was 65.5 percent.\n\"For North Carolina, (the) average hospital occupancy rate is 61% for 2018,\" she said.\nOther estimates PolitiFact found put the average occupancy rate in the 60-to-75 percent range.\nCharles noted that people may get different estimates depending on how they account for beds, among other things.\n\"There could be a difference in how they\u2019re defining capacity, for example whether they are looking at licensed vs. staffed beds, or whether they are considering \u2018current state\u2019 staffing as capacity,\" she said.\nBigger hospitals, fuller spaces\nMark Holmes, director of UNC\u2019s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, agreed with Charles. Holmes said there are different ways to count beds and averages. Staffing levels could also come into play, he said.\nHolmes and his colleagues recently analyzed cost reports filed to Medicare in 2018. Those numbers suggested a 58% occupancy average, he said. It\u2019s likely that some small, rural hospitals bring down the statewide average.\n\"Some of our smaller hospitals are at less than 20%,\" he said. \"But larger ones \u2014 like Duke and UNC\u2014 are indeed at 85% on average throughout the year.\"\nThe Sheps Center recently published a study of NC hospital occupancy rates.\nImportant final point: hospital capacity should not be viewed as the sole indicator of whether it can continue treating patients, Holmes said.\nHospitals need four things to properly treat patients, he said:\n\nsquare feet\u00a0\na license from the government\nequipment (including beds), and\u00a0\nqualified staff.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHospitals may face limits in terms of square footage, Holmes said. But some government agencies are relaxing those regulations and hospitals are creating space where they can, such as dormitories.\nIndeed, Weber said UNC Health is shifting its units around and even using tents outside to triage and treat people with ailments that aren\u2019t as serious as COVID-19.\n\"So the square feet and licenses are less important than, in general, the attention they often receive,\" Holmes said in an email. \"Most people who study this issue think the biggest limitations to capacity are equipment\u2014 e.g. ventilators \u2014 and qualified staff, especially as the epidemic infects staff and their family members.\"\nOur ruling\nJackson said North Carolina\u2019s hospital beds \"are typically 85% full across the state.\"\nThe way he worded his tweet makes it seems like all hospitals are usually at 85% capacity. That\u2019s not right. It depends on the hospital and it depends on the season.\u00a0\nBut he has a point that many of North Carolina\u2019s hospitals routinely treat patients while their facilities are close to maximum capacity. So we rate his claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16854"}
