A recent blog post is in this same genre of misinformation, and wrongly suggests that demonstrations over George Floyd\u2019s death in police custody are part of a larger political plot involving Soros.\u00a0\n\"White busses marked \u2018Soros Riot Dance Squad\u2019 spotted in Michigan: It\u2019s official, the riots are staged,\" reads the headline on a June 2 Intellihub story. \"The invisible man behind the curtain has now become visible.\"\nThe post goes on to say that the buses \"show the current Black Lives Matter/ANTIFA-sponsored unrest is most likely without a shadow of a doubt part of a much larger George Soros, Barack Obama, Democratic National Committee-backed plan aimed at taking back the Office of the President once and for all.\"\nThe proof, the post says, is a photo published on Facebook.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We reached out to Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic organization founded by Soros. The group told PolitiFact that no \"Soros Riot Dance Squad\" buses exist.\u00a0\u00a0\nNext we called Golden Limousine International, a transportation company in Ann Arbor, Mich., mentioned in an Associated Press story about the post. Carol Bell, the company\u2019s director of safety, told us that the buses in the image belong to Golden Limousine. Every day, she said, they\u2019re used as shuttles for Amazon employees, and in the evenings they fuel up at the gas station pictured in the photo. But they don\u2019t say \"Soros Riot Dance Squad.\"\nBell sent us a screenshot of a Facebook post featuring the same photo of the buses without those words added to the image.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17868"}
