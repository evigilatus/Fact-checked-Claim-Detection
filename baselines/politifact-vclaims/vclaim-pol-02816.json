The same story appeared on several other websites reported by Facebook users.\nThe story, which is fake, said Trump on Oct. 8 had revoked the NFL\u2019s \"401(c)(3) status \u2018until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.\u2019 \" (There is no such thing as tax-exempt 401(c)(3) classification in the tax code.) This was a response to players protesting racial inequity by kneeling during the Star-Spangled Banner, which has raised Trump\u2019s hackles in recent weeks.\nNow, it may surprise some to know that the NFL\u2019s league office did have tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit \u2014 a tax classification for business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate and trade boards and yes, professional football leagues. The change in the tax code was granted in 1966, to allow the NFL and AFL to merge without the threat of violating anti-trust laws.\nThe league office essentially acts as a trade organization for the individual teams, which are what make most of the league\u2019s profits, which are taxed. This is different than 501(c)(3) status, which is for charitable organizations.\nBut the league voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status in 2015 after being criticized by politicians who thought the entire league was avoiding taxes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As you know, the effects of the tax-exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years,\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in the letter to team owners that year. \"The fact is that the business of the NFL has never been tax-exempt.\"\nU.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., revived the subject on Sept. 26 when he became lead sponsor of the Pro Sports Act, looking to make the voluntary status change permanent by changing the tax code.\nTrump also brought up the issue on Oct. 10, when he tweeted, \"Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!\"\nSee Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com\nBut he didn\u2019t sign any executive order rescinding the league\u2019s tax status, which it had voluntarily changed already.\nThe fake story appeared to originate two days before Trump\u2019s tweet, in an Oct. 8 post on FreedomJunkshun.com, which looks to be member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers.\nFreedomJunkshun.com uses the same website architecture as other Blair-affiliated sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, \"All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations.\"\nAfter further review, our ruling on the story stands: Pants On Fire!\nSee Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02816"}
