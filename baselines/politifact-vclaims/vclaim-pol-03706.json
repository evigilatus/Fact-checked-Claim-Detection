Seth Moulton, D-Mass.\nIn a Jan. 31 CNN interview, Moulton disagreed with Trump\u2019s misleading comparison of his executive order to actions taken by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration on Iraqi refugees in 2011.\n\"Improvements to the vetting process are something that you'll find bipartisan support for here in Congress. What Trump has done in contrast is just put this blanket ban that will be used against us and our troops,\" said Moulton, who served four tours of duty in Iraq as a Marine Corps infantry officer. \"In fact, ISIS is already using the rhetoric from the Trump administration, the text of this executive order, to incite attacks against us and to recruit more terrorists to their side.\"\nWe previously confirmed that Trump was featured in terrorist propaganda videos for comments during the presidential campaign.\nBut is the text of his executive order now being circulated to incite attacks against the United States and for terrorist recruitment?\nExperts said there have not been official releases from major terrorist groups, though their supporters are talking about it on social media.\nTrump\u2019s executive order\nAbout a week into his presidency, Trump signed an executive order banning immigrants and nonimmigrants from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. The order also banned refugees for 120 days, and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\nThe order was quickly challenged in courts and as of early Feb. 7, there was a temporary restraining order on Trump\u2019s mandate ruled by a federal judge in Washington. The issue is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nWe had not seen reports of ISIS using the ban for recruitment during that week, so we asked Moulton\u2019s office for support for his claim. They directed us to a Jan. 29 Washington Post article headlined, \"Jihadist groups hail Trump\u2019s travel ban as a victory.\"\nA comment on a pro-Islamic State channel on a social media platform, Telegram, compared Trump\u2019s executive order to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, \"which Islamic militant leaders at the time hailed as a \u2018blessed invasion\u2019 that ignited anti-Western fervor across the Islamic world,\" the Washington Post\u00a0reported.\u00a0Other comments described Trump's\u00a0order as\u00a0one that would convince American Muslims to align with extremists, the article said.\nIt also includes comments by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on the Jan. 29 edition of CBS\u2019 Face the Nation: \"The effect will probably in some areas give ISIS some more propaganda.\"\nMcCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C., released a similar, forward-looking statement that said: \"Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism\u00a0... Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\"\nMoulton\u2019s team referred us to tweets by Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, a group monitoring jihadist websites.\nKatz\u2019s tweets posted Feb. 3, a few days after Moulton\u2019s comment, said:\n\"First official #AQ response to #Trump presidency calls him\"foolish\" says \"the flame of Jihad has been ignited & reached the East & West\"\n\"2) #AQ on #Trump's vow to \"eradicate radical Islamic terrorism\": \"not directed only to the mujahideen...but also to the Muslims in general\"\n1) First official #AQ response to #Trump presidency calls him\"foolish\" says \"the flame of Jihad has been ignited & reached the East & West\" pic.twitter.com/C7uX6n5bRf\u2014 Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) February 3, 2017\n\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) #AQ on #Trump's vow to \u201ceradicate radical Islamic terrorism\u201d: \"not directed only to the mujahideen...but also to the Muslims in general\"\u2014 Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) February 3, 2017\n\nKatz told PolitiFact her Feb. 3 tweets were about a statement by al-Qaida, not ISIS, and that the statement she was referring to\u00a0only mentioned a botched Yemen raid and Trump\u2019s vow to \"eradicate radical Islamic terrorism,\" not the ban specifically.\n\"At the official level, there have been no direct mentions of the travel ban by ISIS, al-Qaida, or any other major jihadi terrorist organization,\" Katz said.\u00a0\"Even the sixth issue of ISIS\u2019 monthly Rumiyah\u00a0magazine, which was released this past Saturday, did not mention it.\"\nKatz said silence from such groups is \"absolutely noteworthy, and goes against the conventional jihadi propaganda practice to exploit any event\u2014especially high-profile ones like that of the travel ban\u2014by which Muslims are affected.\"\nTerrorist groups' supporters, mainly al-Qaida supporters, have discussed\u00a0the travel ban\u00a0citing deceased al-Qaida recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki\u2019s statement that the United States will \"turn against its Muslim citizens,\" Katz said. She tweeted about that Jan. 29.\nIn wake of #MuslimBan, jihadis invoke Awlaki's prediction that US will\"turn against its Muslim citizens\";call #Trump \"best caller to Islam\"\u2014 Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 29, 2017\n\nPro-ISIS social media channels are largely posting links to articles with very little commentary, Katz added.\nMoulton\u2019s office also linked us to a tweet from @theosint, identified on its Twitter bio as a contributor to open source and social media investigation group Bellingcat. The tweet, posted Jan. 28, reads: \"ISIS doesn't even share its own propaganda anymore. It just shares CNN and NYTimes articles about the @POTUS muslim ban on Telegram.\"\nISIS doesn't even share its own propaganda anymore. It just shares CNN and NYTimes articles about the @POTUS muslim ban on Telegram.\u2014 The OSINT (@theosint) January 28, 2017\n\nRukmini Callimachi, a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0correspondent who reports on ISIS and al-Qaida, asked @theosint to name what channel was sharing\u00a0New York Times\u00a0stories, because she had not seeing that happen. @theosint replied to her clarifying\u00a0that the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0article wasn't specifically about the ban.\nOn Jan. 30 Reuters reported that an Islamic State supporter in response to Trump\u2019s order posted on Telegram: \"Your decision will do nothing. Attacks will come at you from inside America, from Americans born in America with American parents and grandparents.\"\nSeveral channels on Telegram and on which Islamist militants posted about Trump\u2019s order have been taken down, Reuters noted.\nStill, some experts are cautious about reading sympathizers\u2019 support as official communication.\nTerrorist organizations are emboldened by statements or actions from elected officials, \"but not always in as visible or simple a way as is often implied,\" said Charlie Winter, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, based in London.\n\"I am in no doubt that Trump's executive order will make the lives of ISIS and its like-minded rivals easier, but I would be wary of drawing too linear a link. So far at least, ISIS has made no official pronouncement on the policy, nor has (al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula),\" Winter said via email Feb. 6. \"That said, supporters of the former have expressed that Trump is something of a \u2018useful idiot\u2019 to their group and official propagandists for the latter have written extensively about why Trump bolsters the salafi-jihadist worldview.\"\nTerrorist groups like ISIS use Trump\u2019s \"anti-Islam rhetoric to say that the U.S. is waging war on Islam,\" said William C. Banks, director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University College of Law.\nHowever,\u00a0Banks said he was not aware of specific incitements or attacks based on Trump\u2019s executive order.\nA New York\u00a0magazine profile story\u00a0on Callimachi, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0correspondent focused on ISIS and al-Qaida, also notes that ISIS still had not made an official statement, though militants applauded the order. The\u00a0New York\u00a0piece published online Feb. 5.\nJ.M. Berger, a fellow at International Centre for Counter Terrorism at The Hague, said that while he hasn\u2019t been tracking Islamic State activity daily since Trump\u2019s inauguration, claims like Moulton\u2019s \"often get out ahead of the actuality.\" But he agrees with concerns that Trump\u2019s order may endanger America.\n\"There are several levels at which the travel ban makes things worse. It furthers the jihadist narrative that America is broadly at war with Islam. It also creates new tensions with countries we should be cooperating with,\" Berger said.\nOur ruling\nMoulton said, \"ISIS is already using the rhetoric from the Trump administration, the text of this executive order, to incite attacks against us and to recruit more terrorists to their side.\"\nExperts we communicated with said they believe the order plays into terrorist groups\u2019 message that the United States is at war with Islam. Terrorist groups' sympathizers have discussed the ban on social media channels.\u00a0However,\u00a0experts\u00a0said that neither ISIS or other major groups had made official announcements on Trump\u2019s policy.\nWe rate Moulton's statement Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/908e9926-88fe-485f-abcd-3d3c6039568b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03706"}
