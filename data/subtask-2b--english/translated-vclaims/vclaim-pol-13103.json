Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, defended Medikid from a Republican proposal to change the structure of the federal-state health insurance programme for the poor. Senk Uighur of MSNBC asked whether Democrats would \"have the same passion and struggle to defend Medicaid\" as they were critical of GOP's proposals for medical care reform for those currently under 55 years of age. Brown said the Democrats would fight with the same power. \"It's not a start,\" he said. \"It hurts two groups of people. It hurts poor children. About two thirds of the beneficiaries of medical assistance are children. They're just a third of the cost, because the kids don't get too sick. The other part of Medicaid is older persons, many of them in care homes, low-income older persons, middle-income people who do not have a lot of assets. That's about a third of the people in Midcade, but two thirds of the costs, because... \"So they're after young people -- they're after poor, low-income, middle-income, low-income children, if you will, older people,\" Brown concluded. \"That won't work either, because the public understands it.\" We wondered whether Brown had the correct figures - two thirds of the Medicaid beneficiaries were children, but they accounted for one third of the cost of the programme, while one third were elderly, two thirds of the cost. We have moved on to the statistics produced by the Federal Agency, which runs Medicaid - Medical Care and Aid Services Centre. First, we will look at the numbers detailing who is registered in the program. Table IV.8 here provides two different measures - average monthly enrolment and average number of individual enrolments on an annual basis. Since the numbers are similar, we'll simplify things and choose the second measure. In total, 68.2 million people used Medicaid in 2010. Of that 5.8 million was \"age\" -- 65 years and over -- while 33.9 million were children. An additional 9 million are accounted for separately as beneficiaries of the Ministry of Public Health &apos; s Children &apos; s Health Insurance Programme. (Children are the main beneficiaries of SCHIP, although this figure also includes some of the adults covered by the exemptions; we will ignore that in our calculations.) Thus, 8.5 per cent of Medicaid beneficiaries are elderly and 63 per cent are children. This means that Brown is very close to the percentage of beneficiaries of children, but very low in relation to the percentage of older beneficiaries. If Brown had changed his statement to \"old, blind or disabled,\" he would have been closer. Adding these categories together amounts to 24 per cent, although this is much less than the one third of Brown that was mentioned. Now, we will consider expenditures, using data from Table II.4 here. The most recent data are from 2007. The table shows that 20.7 per cent of medical aid payments were paid to beneficiaries aged 65 and over, while 19.4 per cent supported children. Both numbers are much lower than Brown said. Older persons accounted for two thirds of the cost, while in fact they were just over 20 per cent, and children accounted for one third, while in fact they were less than 20 per cent. The most complex factor is that the largest category of payments - 43.3 per cent - is for those who are blind or disabled. Since statistics are not divided by age, we cannot be sure what the final distribution is. However, if Brown had changed his statement to \"old, blind or disabled,\" he was about to correct the payments. The common category is 64 per cent, slightly less than the two thirds mentioned in the interview. When we asked the Brown office for more information about the senator's claim, his spokesman said that Brown intended to bring \"old, blind or disabled\" together in one category but failed to use the more comprehensive description on the camera. He had made that point in the past when responding to the founding letters on the issue. Even when Brown leaves blind and disabled users of the accounts, he still has a point of view, and Henry Aaron from the Brokings Central Foundation to liberal. The main point of Brown is that older people account for a disproportionate share of the costs of Medicaid. According to our most rigorous calculations, older beneficiaries make up 8.5 per cent of the beneficiaries, but they account for 20.7 per cent of the payments - a cost of two and a half times the size of their numbers. \"The central point, not widely understood, is the right one: although children represent most of the registration, older persons and persons with disabilities make up most of the cost,\" said Aaron. \"This difference -- recording versus cost -- is the main point, and it has this right.\" In the midst of a television interview, Brown misstated Medicaid's statistics, with too simple numbers for both registration and costs. In fact, older beneficiaries do not in themselves represent anywhere close to two thirds of the Medicked costs proposed by Brown. In his view, spending on older persons was disproportionate to their numbers, and it would have been close to precision if he had said \"the elderly, the blind and the disabled,\" as his office had said. However, most of the viewers who heard were not correct, so we appreciate that Brown's statement is hardly true. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to secure the installation, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On July 27, 2011, we changed the name of the evaluation to most of the error.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13103"}
