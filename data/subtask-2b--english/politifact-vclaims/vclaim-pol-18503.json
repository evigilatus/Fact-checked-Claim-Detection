Among the names that have been floated: Sen. Chris Coons and Rep. Karen Bass, both Democrats who have served in Congress for the past decade.\nBut rumors spreading on social media suggest he\u2019s stacking his cabinet with Republicans. We\u2019ve already debunked a claim that Biden tapped Republican Sen. Mitt Romney for the Department of Health and Human Services. And we found no evidence that Biden is considering his Republican predecessor as vice president, Dick Cheney, for a different position.\u00a0\n\"CNN just said Dick Cheney was advising Joe Biden,\" read one Facebook post.\u00a0\n\"CNN says Dick Cheney will be advising Biden on foreign policy,\" another said.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But we found nothing on CNN\u2019s website to suggest that Biden has asked Cheney to be a foreign policy adviser, or any kind of adviser. We found no other news coverage, either, that corroborates these Facebook posts.\u00a0\nBiden has in the past expressed admiration for Cheney, saying, \"I actually like Dick Cheney, for real,\" and calling him \"a decent man.\" Former President George W. Bush, whom Cheney served with, is one of the few senior Republicans who have congratulated Biden on his victory.\nBut there\u2019s nothing to support the claims in these posts, and CNN hasn\u2019t reported on Cheney joining the Biden team.\u00a0\nWe rate them False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18503"}
