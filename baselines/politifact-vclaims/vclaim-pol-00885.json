Beto O\u2019Rourke is officially running for president and that means he was just born to be featured in a Facebook post questioning whether he\u2019s worthy of the White House.\n\"Remind everyone of this pic when this fool says he is gonna run for president,\" reads a Facebook post published on March 14. \"This is Robert O\u2019Rourke (beto).\"\nBelow the text is a photo of a nearly naked man with several words written on his body, including: pansexual, feminist, atheist, vegan, naturist, ecologist, queer and slut.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We then searched for that picture and found what looks like the original, unaltered image. In this version, it looks like the person is standing in front of the Greek parliament in Athens.\nDigging through more photos on websites like Google Images and Flickr, among others, we discovered several more shots of the person on Getty Images. The caption of this photo, by photographer Dimitris Lampropoulos, notes that it\u2019s taken at the Gay Pride Parade in Athens on June 11, 2016.\nWe searched for news reports about O\u2019Rourke attending the parade and found none. He did live-stream a sit-in organized by Democrats at the U.S. House of Representatives that month, speak at a conference on border competitiveness and, on June 12, attended a vigil in El Paso in the wake of a mass shooting of a gay nightclub in Florida. \u00a0\nBut that person in the photo isn't him.
