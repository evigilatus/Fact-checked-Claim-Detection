He touted the economic improvements on his watch, from growing steel production to rising energy sales. Trump launched into an anecdote of sorts that painted a picture of a turnaround in trade with Japan.\u00a0\n\"I told Prime Minister Abe \u2014 great guy \u2014 I said, \u2018Listen, we have a massive deficit with Japan.\u2019 They send thousands and thousands \u2014 millions \u2014 of cars. We send them wheat. Wheat. That\u2019s not a good deal. And they don\u2019t even want our wheat. They do it because they want us to at least feel that we\u2019re okay. You know, they do it to make us feel good.\n\"But the deficit is massive, which is changing rapidly. But what they're doing is, they're buying a lot of our stuff, including our military equipment.\"\nWe\u2019ll check the accuracy of each main point.\n\"They send thousands and thousands \u2014 millions \u2014 of cars.\"\nTrump inflates the total, but not by much. The U.S. Trade Administration says Japan sent about 1.7 million new cars and light trucks to the United States in 2018.\n\"We send them wheat.\"\nWell, the United States does export wheat to Japan, but Trump makes it sound as though this is a large share of U.S.-Japan trade. It isn\u2019t.\u00a0\nIn 2018, wheat represented less than 1% of total U.S. sales to Japan. Corn brought in many more dollars \u2014 $2.8 billion compared to $0.7 billion from wheat.\nThe top ranking U.S. product (based on dollar value) was civilian aircraft, engines, equipment, and parts, which produced $5.6 billion in sales. Industrial machines and liquified natural gas came in second and third, each with about $4.5 billion in sales.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWheat ranked 32nd.\n\nWith the exception of liquefied natural gas sales, which took off in 2016, the sales numbers for aircraft, industrial machinery and other leading products have been fairly steady over time.\nTrump also singled out sales of military equipment. All told, it accounted for about 1.8% of total sales to Japan. No type of military product ranked higher than 26th.\n\"The deficit is massive, which is changing rapidly.\"\nThe overall trade deficit with Japan in goods and services has stayed relatively level at about $57 billion a year since 2016. But not only is it not changing quickly, it rose slightly each year.\u00a0\nThe most recent data runs through the first quarter of 2019. Comparing just the first quarters in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 shows a rise from $13.7 billion in 2016 to $15.5 billion in 2019.\n\nWe reached out to the White House and they had no comment.\nOur ruling\nTrump talked about U.S.-Japan trade in terms of Americans buying Japanese cars while the Japanese bought American wheat. He also said the trade deficit is changing rapidly.\nTrump distorted the actual trade relations in many ways. While he was reasonably correct on the scale of cars imported to the United States, he cast wheat as a major part of U.S.-Japan trade. It accounts for less than 1% of sales. Trump sidestepped the top ranking items of civilian aircraft and related goods, and industrial machinery.\u00a0\nThe numbers also undercut his implication that the trade deficit is changing rapidly for the better. It has held steady, although getting a bit worse each year.\nTrump was close on the car and truck imports, but missed the mark in every other respect.
