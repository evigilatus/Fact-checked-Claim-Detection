Scott Walker is hammering home the notion that Washington needs a \"fresh face.\"\nIt\u2019s a two-edged critique aimed at potential Republican rivals such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and at Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic senator and first lady who is gearing up for 2016.\nThe Clinton-Bush era in the nation\u2019s capital is well known -- from 1980 to 2004, Jeb\u2019s father (George H.W. Bush) or brother (George W. Bush) or Bill Clinton won their party\u2019s nomination for president or vice president. Hillary Clinton, of course, nearly made the top of the Democratic ticket in 2008.\nBut there\u2019s a more sweeping claim making the rounds on social media -- and various websites -- as the 2016 race takes early shape.\nThis is how Washington Post Wonkblog reporter Matt O\u2019Brien put it:\nRepublicans haven\u2019t won a presidential election without a Bush or Nixon on the ticket since 1928.\nSeems kind of unlikely, doesn\u2019t it?\nThat was our first reaction as we quickly tried to do think back through the roster of GOP presidential and vice-presidential contestants over that 84-year span.\nIt\u2019s right on, though.\nIt\u2019s a testament both to the Bush family legacy and to Nixon\u2019s lengthy, comeback-dotted career.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe period in question covers 21 presidential elections starting in 1932. Democrats prevailed 12 times; Republicans 9.\nThe presence of a Bush or Nixon on the ticket turned out to be a boon for Republicans during those eight decades. But it didn\u2019t mean a lock: in two races Republicans fell despite the connection.\nHere we go:\nNixon was Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s running mate in 1952 and 1956 and served as vice president. In 1960, Nixon narrowly lost the presidential contest to John F. Kennedy, but returned to win two terms before resigning amid the Watergate scandal in 1974.\nGeorge H.W. Bush was Ronald Reagan\u2019s running mate and vice president for two terms, then won the presidency in 1988 before bowing to Bill Clinton in 1992.\nFinally, Bush\u2019s son George W. Bush was atop the GOP ticket in 2000 and 2004 before Barack Obama reclaimed the White House for Democrats in 2008 and 2012.\nYou have to reach back to the GOP team of Herbert Hoover and Native American U.S. Sen. Charles Curtis in 1928 to break the streak. They won in a landslide over Democrats Al Smith and Joseph Robinson, with Socialist Party candidate Norman Thomas getting a smattering of support.\nHoover, of course, was ushered out in 1932 as the Great Depression raged, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt era began.\nOur rating\nNo Republican has been elected president since 1928 without a member of the Bush family or Richard M. Nixon on the GOP ticket?\nYou could look it up. But now you don\u2019t have to.\nTrue.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06795"}
