That puts him fifth out of 540 members of Congress. Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., has the most at 59.\n\n\nMost of Paul's bills are substantive \u2013 that is, he doesn't often introduce legislation such as naming post offices, reducing the duty on a specialized piece of manufacturing equipment or congratulating a sports team. Indeed, he's introduced substantive bills such as the Sanctity of Life Act, which fixes the beginning of life at conception; a constitutional amendment to deny citizenship to children of illegal immigrants; and a constitutional amendment with the effect of abolishing income, state and gift taxes.\n\n\nBut in the last Congress, he was far short of being the most prolific bill-writer. He was 25th overall in the number of bills introduced, with 71 bills, 66 of which could be called substantive. We give Robert E. Andrews, D-N.J., the prize for most substantive bills in the 109th. He introduced 128, 119 of them that were substantive.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16614"}
