What he doesn\u2019t propose is raising tax rates to 52% for those low-wage earners.\nInstead, Sanders has proposed increasing the tax rate for the country\u2019s highest earners to 52%; the new tax rate would apply to income earned only above $10 million.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s a significant increase over the current top tax rate of 37%. The Sanders campaign says the increase would generate an additional $700 billion in tax revenue over 10 years. ]\nBut the tax rate wouldn\u2019t affect minimum wage or low-wage workers, whether they earned $7.25 an hour, $15 an hour or $200 an hour.\nThat\u2019s logic.
