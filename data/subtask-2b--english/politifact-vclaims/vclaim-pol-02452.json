What does this say about them? They\u2019re DemocRATS.\"\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news. We found that video of Trump\u2019s speech showed a bipartisan chamber stood up and applauded the victims\u2019 parents.\nTrump invited the parents of Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens, two teenage girls from Long Island, to listen to his speech. The girls were murdered in September 2016 while walking together in their hometown. Members of the MS-13 gang have been charged with their murders, including some who were illegal immigrants.\nWe listened to and watched videos of Trump\u2019s speech to examine the chamber\u2019s reaction.\nJust before he introduced the girls\u2019 parents, Trump made a statement about illegal immigrants that drew an audible hiss from some members. (Listen around minute 43:30)\n\"For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then when Trump spoke to the girls\u2019 parents, the chamber sounded silent.\nSpeaking to the girls\u2019 parents, Trump said: \"Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand,\" he said, as the parents then stood. \"Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you.\"\nThe videos show that members stood up and applauded the girls\u2019 parents.\nSome Democrats did boo and hiss a separate part of Trump\u2019s speech about immigration when he called for an end to \"chain migration.\"\n\"Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives,\" Trump said.\nMany Democrats brought to the speech as their guests Dreamers, people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The future fate of Dreamers is up in the air following Trump\u2019s decision announced last year to end an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\nCSC Mediagroup.USA\u2019s disclaimer proclaims that it isn\u2019t fake news and that it publishes news from a conservative perspective that the mainstream media ignores.\nHowever, in this case it\u2019s headline is wrong. We found no evidence that Democrats \"booed families of children murdered by MS13\" -- instead they booed other comments Trump made about chain migration.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7452073f-d0b4-4684-95f2-d9f7bcbf9cc7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02452"}
