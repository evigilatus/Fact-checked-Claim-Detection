No one making under $400,000, which is more money than I\u2019ve ever made, is going to have to pay more taxes.\"\nBroadly speaking, Biden\u2019s changes would repeal provisions in President Donald Trump\u2019s tax law for taxpayers earning over $400,000 and increase the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, among other measures.\nIndependent analysts agree that Biden\u2019s plan would not directly raise taxes for those earning less than $400,000, though those workers could feel the indirect effects of a corporate tax hike.\u00a0\nBut what about Biden\u2019s description of his own earning history?\nWhen Thomas Kaplan of the New York Times reported on the event in Detroit, he noted parenthetically that \"Mr. Biden has, in fact, made more than $400,000; his tax returns from 2017 and 2018 showed income of many multiples that amount.\"\nThat\u2019s correct, based on the combined incomes of Biden and his wife, Jill, as reported on their joint returns.\nThe Tax Notes archive of presidential candidates\u2019 tax returns shows the following adjusted gross incomes for Joe and Jill Biden for the tax years since 1998:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

(Their 2019 tax return has not yet been made public.)\nThis pattern makes sense: As a senator and later as vice president, Joe Biden\u2019s salary was fixed by law, and Jill Biden worked in teaching. As vice president, Biden earned up to $230,700 a year, and as a senator his annual salary varied from $44,600 when he began serving in the Senate in 1973 to $169,300 by the time he left the chamber in January 2009. The Bidens\u2019 returns going back to 2008 also include income from Social Security benefits.\nBut once Biden departed the vice presidency in January 2017, he could take advantage of more lucrative private-sector opportunities. Both Bidens wrote books afterward, and Joe Biden\u2019s presidential financial disclosure form lists more than four dozen events characterized either as speaking engagements or book tour events, for each of which he typically earned five- and six-figure payments.\nWhen we reached out to the Biden campaign, they said he was referring to his full-time annual salaries as a public official, and that as an employee of the New Castle, Del., county council and a U.S. senator, he never made more than $400,000 annually.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nBiden said $400,000 \"is more money than I\u2019ve ever made\" in a year.\nThat was accurate for most of Biden\u2019s career, when he was in public service and his wife Jill was in teaching. But after Biden left the vice presidency, he earned money from speaking engagements and a book tour, and the couple reported a combined adjusted gross income of more than $11 million and $4 million in successive years.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18902"}
