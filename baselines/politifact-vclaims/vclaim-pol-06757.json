They were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles.\" \u00a0\nOther conservative voices have linked measles to illegal immigrants. The conservative website The Blaze wrote about Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., who said the disease was brought into the country by \"illegal aliens.\"\nThe common thread in these statements is the idea\u00a0that these children were never examined, that they had measles, and Washington took no precautions before allowing them to stay.\nNone of that holds up, however.\nIn fiscal year 2014, over 68,000 unaccompanied minors presented themselves at the border. The crisis spurred a flurry of activity, largely by two government agencies, the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. Homeland Security set up new processing centers and HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement looked after the children until their fates were resolved.\nContrary to Limbaugh\u2019s assertion, the federal government did examine these kids. The protocol, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, was to provide \"vaccinations to all children who do not have documentation of previous valid doses of vaccine.\"\nLimbaugh also claimed that these children were never quarantined if they had a disease. The reverse is true.\n\"Children receive additional, more thorough medical screening and vaccinations at ORR shelter facilities,\" according to the refugee resettlement Web page. \"If children are found to have certain communicable diseases, they are separated from other children and treated as needed.\"\nLatin America outdoes the United States\nFurther undermining Limbaugh\u2019s case (we reached out to his show and did not hear back) are the vaccination rates for the key countries involved in the influx of unaccompanied minors -- El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.\nThe latest data from the World Health Organization runs through 2013. As this table shows, over the past four years, the vaccination rates among those countries are on par or exceed the rate in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n\n\nMeasles, mumps, rubella vaccination rate: \n4-year average\n\n\n\n\nEl Salvador\n\n\n92 percent\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuatemala\n\n\n90 percent\n\n\n\n\nHonduras\n\n\n94 percent\n\n\n\n\nMexico\n\n\n95 percent\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n92 percent\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWith vaccination rates this high, epidemiologists say there is no particular reason to point to children from these countries as the source of a measles outbreak.\nWhat we know about the outbreak\nAs a final point, the information on the measles cases this year reported to health departments fails to suggest a link to immigrant children.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that most of the 102 cases stem from exposures at Disneyland in California. California health officials report that 59 cases emerged directly or indirectly from the amusement park. The core group was made up of 40 people who worked at or visited the park. Neither the CDC nor the California Department of Health have traced the outbreak to one of the young people who entered the country last year.\nIn fact, assistant surgeon general Anne Schuchat said in a news conference that \"we assume that someone got infected overseas, visited the parks and spread the disease to others.\"\nPast measles outbreaks have not been linked to Central America. Last year, Ohio saw 382 measles cases. According to state health officials, that began when unvaccinated travelers came back from the Philippines and spread the disease within the local Amish community. The CDC said nearly 80 percent of the cases that year were among people who chose not to be vaccinated due to their religious beliefs.\nOur ruling\nLimbaugh pinned the current measles outbreak on the Central American children who flooded the southern border in 2014. Limbaugh said they were never examined and that many had measles.\nLimbaugh provided no evidence that this is true. Probably, because no evidence exists. The children who came in from Central America were examined and vaccinated as part of a standard routine.\nThere is no data that links this or any other outbreak of measles to those immigrants, who are vaccinated at about the same rate as Americans. \nThis claim lacks any basis in fact. \u00a0We rate it Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06757"}
