(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s not entirely right. If you don\u2019t live in a state that uses postage-prepaid ballots, you\u2019re responsible for the postage, and ballots can cost more than one 55-cent first-class postage stamp.\nBut, the U.S. Postal Service says it will deliver ballots to election offices even if they lack proper postage.\nHere\u2019s what we know from a July 10 report, \"Voting Outside the Polling Place: Absentee, All-Mail and other Voting at Home Options,\" by the National Conference of State Legislatures:\n\n\nIn most cases, it is up to the voter to pay for postage, although voters often also have the option of using official drop-off sites or dropping off their ballots at election offices in person.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

In other states, voters might need two or more stamps to mail their ballots. But the postal service says it delivers to election offices even ballots that are lacking postage.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17786"}
