The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebilius, at a luncheon organized recently by the Atlanta Press Club, said that \"one of three patients had been hospitalized (affected by the care they received.\" In discussing the need for better health care under the Federal Government &apos; s medical care programme, Sebilius filed the claim. The White House has launched a programme to reduce preventable medical errors. The secretary tried to lead home the seriousness of the case by telling the story of Stone Mountain's woman who was infected during ankle surgery. The woman Sybilius said she needed another surgery to remove the nails she had previously placed in her ankle. She had to take antibiotics at home, and she needed weekly visits from a home health nurse and additional treatment from a doctor to ensure that the infection was eliminated. Sybilius said that such stories are not rare. However, we questioned the hesitation. Is it really one of three? The Secretary &apos; s Office said that her claim came from a recent study in the Journal of Health Affairs. The main title of the study stated that the negative effects of hospital care may be 10 times greater than previously thought. In general, there were adverse events in 33.2 per cent of hospital admissions, a nine-page study said. Several newspapers reported on the findings. \"[Medical errors] is a big issue,\" said Dr. Peter Bronvost, Director of the Johns Hopkins University Research Quality and Safety Group, who was commended for his research on the subject. However, are the statistics quoted by Sebilius correct? Doctors and medical experts began to pay more attention to medical errors during care after a historic study conducted by the Institute of Health in 1999, one of the branches of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers have concluded that up to 98,000 Americans die each year from medical errors. In November, a team of doctors issued its findings on five-year medical records from 10 randomly selected hospitals in North Carolina between 2002 and 2007. They have chosen this situation because they have worked hard to improve patient safety in recent years. The search found \"25.1 patients getting hurt for every 100 admissions.\" The study found that approximately one in five patients had a negative impact on medical care. The largest proportion of damage was due to medical procedures. The drugs were close to a second. The injuries were the third on the list. Dr. Christopher Landrigan, the lead author of the North Carolina study, said the negative impact of medicine could range from a condition requiring hospital stay to something as simple as a rash. Landrigan, assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical Center, said that medical mistakes occur because care and treatment are incomplete. \"The root cause of this is medicine is very complicated,\" said Landrigan, explained why medical errors are alarmingly high. \"There is a great risk that something will go wrong.\" The April report referred to by Sebilius focused on three hospitals of different sizes located in different parts of the United States. The researchers, led by Dr. David S. Klasen, selected patients of all age groups who entered these hospitals during October 2004 and reviewed the records of 795 patients. About 40 per cent of the problems were related to medicines provided for surgery or procedure. The second main reason, about 30 per cent, was related to the procedure. The infection was the third major cause, I found the study. About one third of the problems require longer hospitalization. About 8 percent of patients have caused permanent damage, a measure that saves their lives, or their death. Landrigan said he didn't object to the research in the health report. He said that Klasen and his research colleagues were more experienced in using some of the tools now used to detect medical errors. Klein and his team used a broader definition of harmful events than in other studies, saying that they did not limit themselves to whether they were preventable or led to significant disability. \"In essence, the methodology was very sound,\" said Landrigan. To date, other reviews of the study have been well received. \"This is one of the best studies that now gives us a sense of the extent of the harm that patients in American hospitals suffer,\" said Dr. Robert Water, Head of Medical Services, University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center, American Medical News. Water did not participate in the research. In sum, Sebilius repeated information from a report consistent with another research that shows that the problem of medical errors is gradually worsening. Although the report was not controversial, there were some caveats, such as that researchers used a broader definition of harmful events, some effects were not life-threatening, and the short duration of research in the study. We're assessing Sepelius' claim as mostly correct. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13164"}
