And during the Halloween season, what is better than having an algorithm determine who among us are secretly witches?\nThat\u2019s what many users claim is currently going down on the social media platform.\u00a0\nFacebook posts, like this one, allege that after typing \"#HocusPocus\" in a comment, one of two things will happen: The words will stay the same, revealing you are a muggle (sad) or Facebook will transfigure it into a green bar with the word \"witch.\" Some posts even show comments that have purple bars that say \"head witch\" or the fancy \"grand high witch.\" Talk about a major coven promotion.\nThese posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

You may still yet receive your Hogwarts letter.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll notice the majority of the comments on these posts still say #HocusPocus, because users are genuinely typing it in to see if it changes. The few that appear as \"witch\" or other titles were copied and pasted into the comments.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThese kinds of posts are initially created to amass comments and shares and therefore increase the Facebook page\u2019s engagement.\u00a0\nFact-checking website TruthorFiction.com found the \"witch checker\" claim resembled another challenge \u2013 #911snitch. Those posts alleged that typing #911snitch revealed whether commenters were \"snitches\" if the words stayed the same or not by whether a green bar with a blunt-style cigar displaying \"not a snitch\" appeared. The website found, like #HocusPocus, typing #911snitch, \"did not at any point produce a green bar to prove that you or your friends are not snitches\u2026\"\nA Facebook spokesperson also confirmed to PolitiFact that there is no \"witch checker\" feature.\u00a0\nThe internet has, once again, put a spell on us.
