Virginia is among 24 right-to-work states and supporters have long argued the law spurs economic development and affirms personal freedom. It\u2019s become a rite that successful statewide candidates in the Old Dominion -- Democrats and Republicans -- bow at the law\u2019s altar.\n\nMcAuliffe expressed his fealty during a Jan. 21 speech before the National Federation of Independent Business. \"We are a great right-to-work state,\" he said. \"We should never change that. It helps us do what we need to do to grow our businesses here in Virginia.\"\n\nSo we asked Cuccinelli\u2019s campaign for proof that McAuliffe \"opposes\" the right-to-work law and received a three-page response from spokeswoman Anna Nix.\n\nMuch of the response centered on a June 18 article in The Washington Post that said McAuliffe, during a visit to Northern Virginia, \"declined to say whether he would protect the commonwealth\u2019s status as a right to work state or search for ways to make the state more friendly toward organized labor.\"\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s quoted response in the article, however, says nothing negative about right-to-work.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to work with management. I\u2019m going to work with labor. I\u2019m going to work with everybody to move Virginia forward,\" McAuliffe said. \"It\u2019s not \u2018either-or.\u2019 We are a right-to-work state that has been here for many years, and it\u2019s not going to change. But the focus has got to be not on trying to divide folks. [It] is, how do we work together to grow the Virginia economy to have the most diverse economy to bring in those 21st-century jobs?\"\n\nAt a June 20 news conference in Northern Virginia, McAuliffe was again asked whether he would try to \"soften or weaken\" the law. He replied, \"Right-to-work has been the law here in Virginia for 65 years and I wouldn\u2019t change it.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther backup sent by Cuccinelli\u2019s campaign equated McAuliffe\u2019s friendliness with unions as proof that he opposes the right-to-work law.\n\nBut that\u2019s a flawed argument. \"Just because he says, 'I don\u2019t have a problem with union people,'\u00a0 doesn\u2019t mean he wants to do away with the right-to-work law,\" said James Meath, board chairman of Williams Mullen, a Richmond-based law firm. (Meath represents the Richmond Times-Dispatch in labor matters).\n\nCuccinelli's camp, for example, pointed us to a blog posted by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers in spring 2010 discussing McAuliffe\u2019s plans, which he later dropped, to open an electric car manufacturing plant in Virginia. \"We\u2019re going to have 2,000 folks down there -- all of them union members,\" McAuliffe said of his employment plan.\n\nMeath said it\u2019s legal for McAuliffe or anyone starting a Virginia business to contact a union and say, \"Send me all your people; I\u2019ll hire them.\" The right-to-work law merely states that the employer could not insist those workers remain in the union after they were hired, Meath said.\n\nCuccinelli, in laying his charge against McAuliffe during the radio interview, also noted that his opponent has supported collective bargaining for public workers and has received and has received \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" in campaign donations from organized labor. These issues, however, do not compromise the right-to-work law. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOur ruling\n\nCuccinelli said McAuliffe \"opposes\" the right-to-work law. He focuses on a June 18 news report that McAuliffe, during an interview, refused to defend right-to-work. But McAuliffe, in that article, did not criticize the popular law and was quoted as saying that right-to-work is \"not going to change.\"\n\nOn at least two occasions prior to Cuccinelli\u2019s attack, McAuliffe stated that he would not try to alter the law, which he said \"helps grow our businesses here in Virginia.\"\n\nCuccinelli also makes a guilt-by-association argument, offering McAuliffe\u2019s friendliness with unions as proof that he opposes right-to-work. But this, too, is a flimsy argument: It is entirely possible to support unions and the right-to-work law.\n\nCuccinelli fails to provide credible proof of his claim and we rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09145"}
