There has been no change in the verification and assessment of the original facts. At one of the hottest moments in the recent presidential debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed on Russia's intervention in the current elections. On the occasion of WikiLeaks' release of tens of thousands of e-mails from the Clinton campaign and earlier, the National Democratic Committee, Trump said that Clinton had no idea who hacked and published the e-mail - \"Russian, China or anyone else.\" Clinton responded by asking Trump if he really didn't believe that 17 federal intelligence agencies that Russia said were behind the cyberattack. \"We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, all of which have concluded that these spy attacks, these cyber attacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and that they are the most powerful in the world. \"I find that very annoying.\" In July, when WikiLeaks published the DNA e-mail, the Government had not yet mentioned the perpetrator &apos; s name. On 7 October - on the same day that WikiLeaks issued e-mails to Clinton's campaign leader John Bodista - the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement that said: \"The United States intelligence community is confident that the Russian government has issued recent e-mail concessions from people and institutions in the United States, including from political organizations in the United States.\" The statement added that the recent piracy operations were \"in keeping with the methods and motives of Russia's efforts. These robberies and disclosures are meant to interfere with the United States election process.\" The statement also stated that the intelligence community believed that these attacks were directed at the highest levels of the Russian Government, as Clinton said. \"We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only senior officials in Russia can authorize such activities,\" said the statement. The United States intelligence community consists of 17 agencies, which form the basis of Clinton's claim. The 17 agencies are: Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence Agency, Defence Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Internal Security Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Treasury Department, Counter-Narcotics Law Enforcement Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Naval Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Survey Office, National Security Agency, Maritime Intelligence and Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The 17 separate agencies did not independently declare that Russia was the culprit behind the hacks. The spokesman for Trump Stephen Cheung said that this intervention against Clinton's point: \"The 16 agencies are unlikely to have seen the Russian connection independently, to which Clinton seemed to refer. (Chiong said 16 agencies because the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was removed from several agencies.) However, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, headed by James Klaper, is speaking on behalf of the Group, as head of the intelligence community of 17 agencies. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" \"We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, all of which have concluded that these spy attacks, these cyber attacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and are designed to influence our elections. We do not know how many separate investigations into their attacks. However, the Director of National Intelligence, speaking on behalf of the country &apos; s 17 federal intelligence agencies, issued a joint statement saying that the intelligence community in general is confident that Russia is behind recent hacks into the e-political organization &apos; s e-mail mail. The source of the statement was the attacks to the highest levels of the Russian Government and stated that they were designed to intervene in the current elections. We appreciate that Clinton's statement is correct. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/542ece9a-ae39-433c-8215-4a41906b75c9 Update, 6 June 2017: Claper May's certificate for a more recent report, not the October evaluation That is why we disagree with this interpretation. We wrote this article on October 19, 2016, in response to a joint statement by the former Claber office, which oversees the entire intelligence community and internal security. On the other hand, it was Congressional testimony given in May 2017 by Clapper on the most comprehensive report issued by the CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency in January 2017. The process of compiling this report began only months after we published this article, in December 2016, at which point the intelligence community decided to limit the investigation to those three agencies. That's what Clapper said, according to Congress quarterly. \"CA\" refers to January 2017 \"Intelligence Society Assessment.\" \"In addition, I will briefly address four relevant topics that have emerged since the production of international competition law. Because of the classification and some restrictions on executive privileges requested by the White House, there are limits to what I can discuss. Of course, my direct official knowledge of any of this ceased on 20 January when my term happily ended. As you know, he was a coordinating producer from three agencies, the CIA, the NSA, and the FBI. These three are under the auspices of my former office. Following extensive intelligence reports on many Russian efforts to collect and influence the results of the presidential elections, President Obama asked us to do so in early December and to complete it before the end of his term. The January report presented its findings by saying \"we're staying,\" with \"we\" meaning \"evaluation by the three agencies.\" On the other hand, the October statement said, \"The CIA is confident\" in its assessment. As stated in the article, the 17 separate agencies did not reach this conclusion independently, but the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks for the group as head of the intelligence community. We stand by our assessment.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04097"}
