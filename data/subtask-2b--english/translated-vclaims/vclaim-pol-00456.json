This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The gun rights organization commented on its function, and told users to read more and share a link to Fox News. The story is about an educational plan (Baiden) issued on May 28. The story indicates that the plan says: \"As President, it will ensure that the arms legislation is passed to make our students safer, knowing that he can do so because he has beaten the National Venice Society twice before. It will again begin to defend its 1994 ban on offensive weapons and high-capacity magazines. In the coming months, additional proposals will be issued to address the scourge of gun violence in our country.\" The 1994 Act focused on 18 specific firearms and the prohibition of certain AR-15 and AK-47 models. It is illegal to make these weapons for use by ordinary citizens during the 10 years when the embargo was in force. However, as the Washington Post Ban Manual indicates, it was lawful to possess or resell any offensive weapon made before the entry into force of the law, which means that if you have a prohibited gun before the ban, you can keep or sell it. When we asked the National Republican Army about the article, Amy Hunter, a spokesman for the Organization's Legislative Action Institute, said: \"When we say that Joe Biden promises to ban weapons, we mean exactly what we say: he plans to ban weapons. We did not say 'all weapons', and we did not classify them as 'a comprehensive arms embargo'. If he wanted to ban \"the so-called offensive weapons,\" he called for an arms embargo on \"millions and millions of weapons,\" including people's AR-15s. But Biden's saying that he's asking for a gun ban can lead readers to believe that he's trying to ban all firearms. She hopes that in the United Kingdom, for example, four dynasty dogs are forbidden to own bulls among other dogs. But to say that England banned stray dogs; someone could understandably think that they wouldn't allow dogs there. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the remarkable fact-finding story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, Andrew Bates, spokesman for the Biden campaign, said that the education plan was the only policy plan launched by the campaign on weapons. Paden spoke of the \"smart gun\" policy when he was asked about gun violence during the democratic debate on June 27. He said, \"We must have smart weapons.\" \"No weapon should be able to sell unless your biometric measure can pull that trigger. We have a right to do that. We can do this. Our enemy is the arms manufacturers, not the National Republican Army. Arms manufacturers.\" Biden has been calling for regulations requiring manufacturers to include a biological system that prevents people from firing unless their fingerprints are registered in that specific weapon. On June 29, Axis published a brief story where the 2020 Democrats stand on arms control. Biden says that only \"smart weapons\" - which require \"biology\" to pull the trigger - should be sold. It has also supported the Government in buying arms from its owners. Hunter from the National Republican Army said that Paden had a long history of sounds and statements explaining his opinion. Hunter cited seven votes made by Bayden on firearms issues since 1990, including amendments to the ban on certain rifles, pistols considered to be offensive weapons and semi-automatic weapons. Our government said the National Republican Army has requested an arms embargo. He called for an offensive arms embargo, and he has a history of trying to ban certain weapons. But while competing for a democratic presidential nomination, it does not promise to prevent Americans from possessing any weapon. He would once again support a ban on offensive weapons and high-capacity magazines such as the one he had endorsed in 1994. These prohibitions have prevented the manufacture and sale of certain weapons to ordinary citizens for use; they have not confiscated or prohibited the sale of weapons purchased prior to the entry into force of the restrictions. The Facebook article contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00456"}
