Amy Klobuchar was on those topics.\nAs president, Klobuchar said, she would unleash the bargaining power of Medicare to lower drug prices. But she noted what she would be up against: \"There are, literally, two pharmaceutical lobbyists for every member of Congress. They think they own Congress. They don\u2019t own me.\"\nThe Minnesota Democrat\u2019s comment tapped into ongoing concern about the political power of drugmakers in the ongoing debate over U.S. drug prices, which are the highest in the world for brand-name products.\nCongress and the president say they want to lower them, but so far there\u2019s been little demonstrable action or results.\nWe decided to take a look: Are lawmakers in Washington that outnumbered by pharma lobbyists?\nWe contacted Klobuchar\u2019s campaign to find out the basis for her statement. They quickly sent over information from OpenSecrets \u2014 a website that tracks the number of lobbyists and the spending on lobbying \u2014 and promised to get back in touch with confirmation that the site was the senator\u2019s source. We haven\u2019t heard any more.\nBy the numbers \nStill, the OpenSecrets information became our starting point. Their data comes from reports filed quarterly by lobbyists, lobbying firms and organizations with the secretary of the Senate. Lobbyists must register with the secretary\u2019s office if they are paid to lobby on behalf of a client, make more than one contact with government officials regarding the client\u2019s issues and spend at least 20% of their time on lobbying and related activities.\nOpenSecrets counted 1,451 pharmaceutical/health products lobbyists in 2018, the last full year of data available. That category goes beyond just prescription drugs to include lobbyists for medical device makers and producers of over-the-counter health products.\nUsing a narrower definition that included only lobbyists representing pharmaceutical manufacturing interests, the group\u2019s count came to 828.\nSo then we did the math. There are 535 members of Congress; 100 serve in the\u00a0 Senate and 435 in the House of Representatives.\nIt turns out Klobuchar is either over- or undercounting, depending on how broadly one defines the pharmaceutical industry.\nThere are 2.7 lobbyists per member of Congress if one looks at the broader pharmaceutical/health products industry, but only 1.5 per member when considering only drugmakers.\n\"It\u2019s a lot either way,\" said Steven Knievel, the access-to-medicines advocate at Public Citizen.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd how do these tallies stack up against other industries?\nThe 1,451 pharma/health products lobbyists outnumbered lobbyists in all 89 other categories, according to an analysis by Daniel Auble, a senior researcher at OpenSecrets. The electronics manufacturing and equipment industry came in second, with 1,121 lobbyists last year. Education was third, with 1,027. Tied for last place \u2014 with eight each \u2014 were lobbyists for women\u2019s issues and those lobbying for or against abortion rights.\nIndustry lobbyists outnumber consumer lobbyists across the board, said experts. And that means members of Congress and their staffers are \"hearing over and over again from industry because it has more lobbyists than anyone else,\" said Lee Drutman, senior fellow at the think tank New America and author of The Business of America Is Lobbying.\nMany of those lobbyists are more experienced than the young staffers they meet with, he noted. When lawmakers and staff members hear far more from one side of an issue, it can lead to a \"distorted picture of how regulations might work or affect public health,\" said Drutman.\nKnievel agreed. When he heads to Capitol Hill to talk with lawmakers, they\u2019ve generally heard more from industry than \"from people who are trying to lower health costs,\" he said. \"Having the resources and human power to do that makes them formidable and influential.\"\nThe second part of Klobuchar\u2019s statement \u2014 that drug company lobbyists \"own Congress\" \u2014 brings up another element of this issue: In Washington, money and lobbying go hand in hand. The drug industry certainly has one of the biggest war chests for spending on lobbying.\nLast year, lobbying spending by pharmaceutical groups and health product providers, which includes makers of medical devices and other health-related items, totaled $283 million, according to OpenSecrets.\nThe amount spent by drugmakers alone is huge: $169 million lobbying last year. That\u2019s the most since 2009, in the heat of the debate over the Affordable Care Act.\nThe second-place finisher, the insurance industry, spent $158 million.\nSo what\u2019s the drug industry lobbying on? Its latest concerns revolve around drug prices. Whenever it perceives a threat or an opportunity \u2014 such as when Congress was debating the ACA in 2009, or now, with candidates, the president and Congress all focused on the high price of prescription medicines \u2014 the industry ramps up spending.\n\"Companies are somewhat responsive to the political environment,\" \u00a0\u00a0said Drutman.\nAnd, of course, the drug industry funnels millions of dollars in campaign contributions directly to members of Congress each year.\nOur ruling\nKlobuchar said: \"There are, literally, two pharmaceutical lobbyists for every member of Congress.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nWe found that there are more than twice as many pharma lobbyists per member of Congress if one looks at the broader category that includes representatives of health products, but only 1.5 per member if the comparison is restricted only to those lobbying for drug companies.\nWe rate her statement as Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00388"}
