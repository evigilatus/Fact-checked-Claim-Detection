Also in France, they have a program a thousandfold more invasive collecting all of the data of all the French. Yet they still weren't able to see this coming.\"\nWe wanted to gauge whether the French system is far more invasive than the one in the United States.\nMass surveillance 101\nThe key U.S. surveillance laws include the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, passed in 1978, and the USA Patriot Act, which was passed in 2002 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\nPortions of these laws have been variously reauthorized and revised, but the most relevant parts for analyzing Paul\u2019s claim have to do with two broad topics: the process for eavesdropping on specific targets, and the collection of \"bulk\" metadata, which is information about the timing and frequency of electronic communications but not the content.\nFrance had already been engaged in bulk data collection on a scale similar to or even more expansive than the United States, according a 2013 report by leading French newspaper Le Monde.\nBut this year -- between the Jan. 7 terrorist attack on magazine Charlie Hebdo and the Nov. 13 attacks across Paris -- France clarified its policy with the passage of a new law on surveillance. The controversial law was initially passed in June and upheld in August by France\u2019s Constitutional Council with some limited revisions.\nWhere the two countries\u2019 surveillance programs are similar\nThe French approach mirrors that of the U.S.\u00a0approach in several ways.\nThe French law requires Internet and telecommunications companies to install \"black boxes\" that vacuum up raw data about users that can be searched by computerized algorithm. This is broadly similar to the once-secret data-collection program known as PRISM, which came to light due to revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden. (The current status of the bulk data collection program is somewhat murky; authorization for bulk data collection expired on June 1, 2015, and then was extended by lawmakers for six months on an interim basis to facilitate transition to a new system. That period has just ended.)\nIn addition, French law enforcement can seek permission to eavesdrop on specific targets, and that means that people who interact with those approved targets can have their communications scrutinized in that process as well, whether or not they themselves are suspected of being involved in illegal activities. This mechanism is broadly similar to the one in the United States. And French law enforcement, like U.S. law enforcement, has the ability under the law to conduct \"warrantless\" wiretaps that sidestep prior judicial approval, at least in some cases.\nFinally, critics of both countries\u2019 laws have said they both contain inadequate provisions for transparency and whistleblower activities. Snowden has previously said that weak whistleblower protections helped convince him to go public about the National Security Agency\u2019s activities rather than following official protest channels.\nThese similarities aside, there are at least five ways in which France\u2019s system is arguably more muscular than the one in the United States.\nWhere the French system goes further than the United States\u2019 system\n\u2022 Judicial review. Under the United States\u2019 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, law enforcement officials must go to a special judicial court to receive permission to conduct electronic surveillance of American citizens. Historically, law enforcement officials have generally gotten what they\u2019ve wanted from the court, leading critics to question how much of a hurdle this is. Still, the fact that members of the judiciary are passing judgment on the government\u2019s requests does provide at least a modicum of independent oversight.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy contrast, under the French system\u2019s analogous body, only a minority of members of the National Commission for the Control of Intelligence Techniques -- six of 13 -- are judges. Another six are legislators and the last is a technical expert. The panel can be overruled by the prime minister.\n\"Because there is no opportunity for independent and neutral judges to decide whether surveillance of a particular target is justified (in the French system), there is a heightened risk that government officials might engage in improper monitoring,\" wrote Nathan A. Sales, a Syracuse University law professor in an analysis commissioned by the bar association of Paris while the law was being debated.\nSales held senior positions in the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush and was involved in the drafting of the Patriot Act.\n\u2022 Lack of \"minimization.\" The United States\u2019 system takes steps, albeit imperfect ones, to focus intelligence collection on suspicious behavior, thereby \"minimizing\" the amount of unrelated data swept up. These can involve restricting who can see the information, how long it may be retained, and whether or how it can be disseminated, Sales wrote.\nBy contrast, the French system has few if any such protections, Sales wrote. He suggested an area of particular concern is a \"lack (of) any limits on the monitoring of privileged communications between attorneys and their clients.\"\n\u2022 Search and seizure. One of the more contentious parts of the Patriot Act has involved delayed-notification searches -- that is, searches of properties in which the target not only isn\u2019t present but is not even notified about the search until well after it takes place. These are sometimes called \"sneak and peek\" searches, or \"sneak and steal\" when it involves seizing and removing items from the location.\nThese types of searches existed before the Patriot Act, but their use was tightly constrained; the Patriot Act loosened the rules.\nThe French system, meanwhile, permits even more expansive action for tracking data and communications during such searches than the United States does, critics say. Under the French law, bugs, cameras and keystroke loggers could be planted during such searches, according to multiple media reports.\n\u2022 Location-based surveillance. The French law allows the use of devices variously known as \"proximity sensors,\" \"cell site simulators,\" \"IMSI catchers\" or \"Stingrays.\" Rather than targeting surveillance on a specific person, these devices allow surveillance of cellphone calls and text messages at a given location. Privacy advocates say this technology is likely to capture communications by uninvolved bystanders.\nIn the United States, it is Justice Department policy to seek a FISA probable-cause warrant before using such techniques. On paper, at least, that appears to be a tougher hurdle than what the French law includes.\n\u2022 Going beyond terrorism. The Patriot Act includes terrorism in its title (it\u2019s the final \"t\" in the acronym \"patriot\"), and at the FISA court, the government must show that the target is an \"agent of a foreign power,\" which has generally been interpreted to mean a spy or a terrorist.\nBy contrast, the French law includes some broader justifications for action, including protecting France\u2019s \"economic, industrial and scientific interests\" and prevention of \"organized delinquency.\"\n\"In general, I think it\u2019s accurate to say that French surveillance law is more permissive than U.S. surveillance law,\" Sales said in an interview.\nBob Turner, a professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for National Security Law, agreed.\n\"Our system is far more respectful of individual rights,\" Turner said. \"The French have no equivalent to the Fourth Amendment (protection against search and seizure), and both law enforcement and intelligence services routinely collect data that would require a warrant here.\"\nOur ruling\nPaul said that \"in France, they have a (surveillance) program a thousandfold more invasive\" than the United States.\u2019 \"\nThe term \"a thousandfold\" is impossible to measure and is presumably a rhetorical flourish on Paul\u2019s part. Still, we found five notable areas in which the French system offers law enforcement and government officials more unfettered tools than American officials have the ability to use.\nWe rate Paul\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05640"}
