To the contrary, the senator has often said he opposes such action. Let\u2019s take a deeper look.\nBackground\nGade is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who lost his right leg in combat in Iraq. He has a Ph.D. in public administration and policy and is a professor at American University. This is his first run for public office.\nThe \"defund\" movement calls on local governments to shift spending on law enforcement to programs that address economic and social issues for minorities. It came to the forefront after the May 25 death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police.\nPresident Donald Trump and other Republicans have depicted the defunding movement as a dismantling of police forces. Trump, who is running a law and order reelection campaign, has repeatedly accused Democratic nominee Joe Biden of wanting to defund police. PolitiFact National recently rated the claim False, pointing to a CBS interview in which Biden said he opposed the policy.\nSome protestors in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death have called for the elimination of police forces.\u00a0\nBut many supporting defunding say it doesn\u2019t mean an end to policing but, rather, a reallocation of some of the money and work that has traditionally gone to police departments. For example, instead of dispatching police to routine problems involving the homeless or drug abusers, they say it would be better to send officials from other municipal departments that have training in treating such people. Some of the funds going to police, they say, would be better spent treating mental illness and addiction.\nWarner\u2019s record\nWarner has said at least four times that he opposes defunding police. All of his statements came at least a month before Gade accused him of backing the policy.\u00a0\n\n\nDuring a June 8 Facebook town hall meeting, Warner said, \"Let me be clear, I don\u2019t support defunding the police.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a June 11 article by Channel 29 in Charlottesville, Warner was quoted saying, \"...I don\u2019t think we should get caught in these slogans like defunding the police. To me, that\u2019s not where I\u2019m headed. I\u2019m looking at reform, criminal justice reform.\"\n\n\n\n\nOn June 19, Channel 12 in Richmond aired a report on the policing positions of Warner; Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va; and Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-Va. The report said, \"All three disagree with the \u2018defund the police\u2019 slogan\u2026\" The report was posted on Warner\u2019s campaign site.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDuring a June 22 Facebook town hall meeting, Warner said of defunding police, \"I don\u2019t think that slogan or that policy is something that I support.\"\n\n\nWarner is among 36 Democratic senators that have endorsed a police reform bill by Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J. It would:\n\n\n\u00a0Make police officers more legally liable for misconduct;\n\n\n\u00a0Improve data collection so that an officer\u2019s misconduct record would be available if he applied to work for another police force;\n\n\nImprove police training and ban chokeholds.\n\n\nGade\u2019s Response\nWe were unable in three attempts to reach Gade\u2019s campaign. Gade, however, responded to a July 23 blog - posted by Blue Virginia, a liberal website - accusing him of telling \"lies\" about Warner\u2019s defunding stance.\u00a0\u00a0\nGade, replying on Facebook the next day, said Warner\u2019s position on police reform is \"confusing.\" He added, \"It\u2019s time to get some straight talk. Mark, do you support defunding the police or not? We\u2019re all awaiting your answer.\"\nOur ruling\nOn July 22, Gade said Warner is \"calling to defund the police.\" He repeated the claim two days later.\nWarner, at least a month before Gade\u2019s statements, said he is opposed to defunding police. The senator staked out his position in virtual town hall meetings, TV reports, and on his campaign website. The statements can be easily found, clear as day.\nWe rate Gade\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17813"}
