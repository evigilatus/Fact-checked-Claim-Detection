Imagine taking less than 30 minutes out of your day to make the trip. If Hyperloop One builds a routein Missouri, that\u2019d be a reality.\n\n\nHyperloop is a transportation system that functions like a high-tech train, moving people in tubes from city to city at speeds similar to air travel.\n\n\nPatrick McKenna, director of the Missouri Department of Transportation, said Missouri is an appealing candidate for a Hyperloop route.\n\n\n\"Officials at Hyperloop One have referred to the route as one of the best they\u2019ve ever seen,\" he told the Kansas City Business Journal on Oct. 19.\n\n\nBut did Hyperloop One officials say the St. Louis-Kansas City route is one of the best they\u2019ve seen?\n\n\nWhat is Hyperloop?\n\n\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX,\u00a0published a white paper for Hyperloop in 2013, which was presented to former President Barack Obama later that year. According to its website, Hyperloop Technologies Inc.\u00a0was established in Los Angeles in 2014.\n\n\nEarlier this year, the company successfully tested its propulsion system with the car in the tube, and the company projects three Hyperloop systems will be completed by 2021.\n\n\nEssentially, Hyperloop utilizes magnetic accelerators in a low-pressure tube system in order to propel rotors in individual capsules. The vehicles hover slightly off the track in the tube through magnetic levitation. This special environment allows a blazing top speed of 670 mph.\n\n\nMissouri efforts\n\n\nIn May 2016,\u00a0Hyperloop One opened its Global Challenge, urging cities and regions around the world to submit their pitches for a Hyperloop network. More than 2,600 proposals were sent to Hyperloop. Missouri submitted its application that fall, and was named as one of the 35 semifinalists in February 2017.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJay Nixon\n\n\nstated on August 20, 2015 in comments at the Missouri State Fair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Almost nine out of every 10 pennies that would be spent\" turning a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 70 into a toll road \"would be from folks outside Missouri.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Allison Graves \u2022 September 29, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe reached out to Hyperloop One officials, who didn\u2019t respond, and to the Missouri Department of Transportation. Special assignment coordinator Robert Brendel directed us to links about the challenge.\n\n\nOn Sept. 14, 2017, Hyperloop announced its winners via a press release. Even though it didn\u2019t win, the Missouri route was designated as one of 11 finalists invited to continue developing the proposal.\n\n\nIn response to being named a finalist, state officials established the Missouri Hyperloop Coalition in October to continue the conversation. The coalition includes MoDOT, the University of Missouri System, St. Louis Regional Chamber and the KC Tech Council.\n\n\nDan Katz, Hyperloop\u2019s director of global public policy,\u00a0told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u00a0that the creation of the coalition helped the Missouri route\u2019s future chances.\n\n\n\"They were on the edge in that competition,\" Katz told the newspaper. Now, he said, \"they are as competitive\" as any on the initial list.\n\n\nThe company had previously weighed in as part of Missouri\u2019s aggressive pitch for attracting Amazon to either St. Louis or Kansas City for its second headquarters. Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd is featured in a short video about the potential for the transportation system in the state, which is available on the\u00a0state\u2019s Amazon HQ pitch website.\n\n\nThe video is sponsored by the state\u2019s Department of Economic Development, but the praise comes from Lloyd himself.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nMcKenna said Hyperloop officials called the proposed route between Kansas City and St. Louis \"one of the best they\u2019ve ever seen.\"\n\n\nThe Hyperloop One CEO said the coalition proposed a great route. Its director of global public policy said the St. Louis-Kansas City route is \"as competitive\" as any on the initial list.\n\n\nBut there\u2019s no public record that any Hyperloop official ever called the route the best they\u2019ve ever seen. Hyperloop selected 10 winners of its global challenge. Missouri was not on that list.\n\n\nWe rate this claim\u00a0Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02589"}
