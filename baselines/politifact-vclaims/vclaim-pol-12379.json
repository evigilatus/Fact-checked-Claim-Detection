Brent Barton says credit analysts realize that Oregon\u2019s instability 'stems in large part from Oregon's kicker system'", "text": "Oregon\u2019s \"kicker law\" is often kicked around in political fights over spending and taxes. Republicans, generally, want to leave the refund law alone and force the state to save money by spending less. Democrats, generally, say the kicker is a constitutionally built-in anti-savings mechanism.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, the kicker is officially called the state\u2019s surplus refund law. It requires a refund to taxpayers if the state collects more money in taxes -- by at least 2 percent -- than economists projected. The idea is to make sure legislators don\u2019t spend every dime they get from taxpayers.\n\nFormer state Rep. Brent Barton, a Democrat who represented part of Clackamas County, recently wrote a guest column for The Oregonian in which he urged the state to divert the kicker and use the money to build a savings fund that could boost our credit rating, which in turn would save millions of dollars in lower interest payments.\n\n\"The ratings agencies will not upgrade Oregon's credit rating until we stabilize state finances, and they realize that our instability stems in large part from Oregon's kicker system,\" he wrote.\n\nWe can\u2019t predict what ratings agencies will or won\u2019t do, and neither can anyone else. Instead, PolitiFact Oregon had a simple question: Do credit ratings analysts actually finger the kicker as responsible for the state\u2019s financial instability?\n\nSteve Buckstein of the Cascade Policy Institute, which promotes limited government, argues that without the kicker, legislators would spend every penny on hand for pay raises and new programs. The pressure not to spend is too great, he said.\n\nOn the other hand, the kicker could \"kick\" at awkward times, for example, after drastic funding reductions, as The Oregonian\u2019s Harry Esteve illustrates in this 2009 news story:\n\u00a0\n\n\"At the end of each legislative session, the state economist makes his best guess about how much revenue the state stands to receive over the next two years. He has lots of data to work with, and a complex set of equations, matrices and algorithms. But it's still a guess.\n\n\nIf he sets a low figure -- which makes sense this year given the current economic conditions -- and then the economy rebounds, the state could end up sending millions of dollars back to taxpayers at the same time it is making deep cuts to services. It happened during the last recession, in 2001, and there are growing fears it could happen again.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the problem?\n\nLet\u2019s turn to the actual reports, to see for ourselves what analysts have said. Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s Investor Service, and Fitch are the houses that determine our creditworthiness, which in turn determines the interest rate at which we borrow money. For example, they loved that Oregon started a savings fund in 2007 by diverting the corporate kicker that year.\n\nAll three agencies consistently cite the state\u2019s narrow reliance on economically sensitive corporate and personal income tax revenues as a negative.\n\nThey also dislike Oregon\u2019s active citizen initiative process because it means voters can restrict how much money we collect and how we spend that money. Their big issue is reliability. \u00a0\n\nMany times, but not always, the kicker law is singled out as an added concern. A March 7 Moody\u2019s report says the kicker \"adds budgetary challenges, including cash flow pressures.\"\n\nDoes that mean that a repeal of the kicker would increase our rating? Or that the existence of the kicker means we\u2019re doomed to a lower rating? Kimberly Lyons, the primary analyst for Moody\u2019s for Oregon, wouldn\u2019t go so far. Ability to govern is what they measure and the kicker is not a defacto defect, Lyons said.\n\n\"There are other ways to make the structure work for the state. As long as the state is structurally balanced, that\u2019s all we care about.\"\n\nBut Gabriel Petek of Standard & Poor\u2019s was more willing to weigh in on the kicker. He said that while Oregon\u2019s reliance on income taxes is the \"main driver\" of the state\u2019s financial volatility, the kicker makes it difficult to build reserves because we can\u2019t reap the benefits of economic upsides to manage for the economic downsides. It\u2019s as if we\u2019ve deliberately hobbled ourselves.\n\nBack to Barton. He checked in with PolitiFact Oregon while traveling. He said he should have stressed that the kicker magnifies Oregon\u2019s fiscal instability rather than causes it.\n\n\"I probably should have been more precise in wording that sentence, as the verb \u2018stems\u2019 implies causation more than magnification. However, the fact remains that the ratings agencies recognize that the kicker system contributes significantly to Oregon's unstable fiscal system.\"\u00a0\n\nFinally, we checked in with state Treasurer Ted Wheeler, who manages our money. \u00a0He acknowledged that if Oregon had jobs galore and oodles of extra money in the bank, the ratings agencies could upgrade us anyway, without kicker reform. But that\u2019s not the case, he said, and so analysts continue to call out the kicker as a concern.\n\nBut doesn\u2019t our financial instability really stem from our unnaturally high reliance on income and corporate taxes?\n\n\"The two go hand-in-hand. You can\u2019t really separate them,\" Wheeler said.\n\n\"You\u2019ve got the volatility from our reliance on the income tax, which in my mind is the most significant issue. You have all of your eggs in one basket, and the basket we\u2019ve chosen is the volatility basket, and then when you combine the kicker with that, the two really are like the evil twins. They work hand in hand to make it hard for government to plan through a reliable revenue structure.\"\n\nSo what have we learned? Certainly government could save money without the kicker. But the kicker does exacerbate the volatility of the system that we\u2019ve chosen to pay for public services. And the two analysts we interviewed were understandably wishy washy on how Oregon\u2019s kicker figures into the state\u2019s credit rating.\n\nIn a previous PolitiFact, we gave Rep. Matt Wand, R-Troutdale, a Mostly False for saying that previous Legislatures suspended the kicker, spent every dime and failed to stabilize state finances. (We explained that serious context was missing.)\n\nIn this PolitiFact, we come to a similar conclusion about Barton\u2019s statement regarding the kicker\u2019s relationship to financial stability. Oregon\u2019s instability stems mainly from our heavy reliance on one revenue stream. The simplest way to counter that may be to divert the kicker. But a bigger difference, the reports suggest, would be made by adding other taxes -- hello, sales? -- to diversify Oregon\u2019s revenue base. (Sorry, we had to say it.)\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12379"}
