Eric Kearney, who leads the Senate\u2019s Democratic caucus, said voters have the right to decide the fate HB 194. He said Republicans were unconstitutionally taking away their right to referendum by repealing the law before the election on Nov. 6.\n\n\"This is the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum,\" Kearney, of Cincinnati, said during the floor debate March 28.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Senate passed the bill to repeal HB 194 on a party-line vote that day, sending the bill to the House of Representatives for consideration.\n\nAnytime an elected official utters the words \"this is the first time in Ohio history,\" we at PolitiFact Ohio become instantly curious. So we decided to dig into Kearney\u2019s claim.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to recognize that the legislation passed last month, Senate Bill 295, does not directly stop the referendum on HB 194. It essentially nullifies the referendum because it repeals the law, therefore there would be no law to put before voters.\n\nKearney\u2019s larger point \u2013 that repealing HB 194 before the referendum vote is unconstitutional \u2013 is ripe for debate and, many lawmakers agree, likely will be decided in court if the House also passes SB 295 and the governor signs it.\n\nAn attempt to verify Kearney\u2019s assertion that the repeal is unprecedented could help shed light on the situation. If the senator is wrong, a similar case could help answer the question of the repeal\u2019s constitutionality.\n\nWe checked with several government and legal sources and could not find an identical situation in Ohio\u2019s history.\n\nThe provision to allow Ohioans to challenge a law passed by the General Assembly was included in the Ohio Constitution in 1912, according to a history of ballot issues maintained by the Secretary of State\u2019s office.\n\nMike Rowe, spokesman for the Senate Democratic caucus, said the caucus\u2019 legal staff could not find a similar case despite research that looked at the Ohio Revised Code, legislative records and discussions with staff members.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate and House also came up empty.\n\nSenate GOP spokeswoman Angela Meleca said the caucus\u2019 legal staff, along with the Ohio Legislative Services Commission, looked back and could not find another case of the General Assembly repealing a bill that is up for a referendum.\n\n\"There was nothing that matched or fit this scenario,\" Meleca said.\n\nCarrie Davis, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, testified before a Senate committee on March 21 that the Ohio Supreme Court had never addressed the question of repealing a bill up for a referendum.\n\n\"If we\u2019re all hitting the same wall and not finding anything, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s there,\" Davis said in an interview.\n\nThere was one case with similarities, but it fell short of exactly matching the repeal of HB 194.\n\nLawmakers passed a bill last year to establish new congressional districts. The legislation replaced districts established by an earlier bill, House Bill 319, that spurred a referendum effort backed by Democrats. But when the second bill, House Bill 369, passed with a new map, the referendum effort ceased because the new maps replaced the old ones involved in the referendum.\n\nThe partial repeal of HB 319 is different, though, because Democrats dropped their bid to collect the signatures needed to get a referendum on the ballot. In the case of HB 194, Secretary of State Jon Husted last year certified that petitioners met the requirements to place the referendum on the November ballot.\n\nSo Kearney appears to be on solid ground. But it is important to remember the bill to repeal HB 194 has not been passed in the House. So the repeal is not official yet, although Republican House Speaker William G. Batchelder supports it.\n\nNevertheless, the experts we talked to all agreed that Kearney\u2019s point that the repeal would be a first in Ohio history is accurate.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11311"}
