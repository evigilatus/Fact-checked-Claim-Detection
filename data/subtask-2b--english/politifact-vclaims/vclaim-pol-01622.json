Jeff Merkley berated the Trump administration for diverting nearly $10 million from emergency funding to immigration enforcement.\n\"As #HurricaneFlorence bears down, I discovered today that the Trump Administration is taking money away from @FEMA so that they can pay to put more asylum seekers in detention centers. This is a scandal,\" Merkley of Oregon tweeted on Sept. 11. (FEMA is an acronym for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.)\nMerkley appeared on MSNBC\u2019s The Rachel Maddow Show on Sept. 11 and said he obtained documents about the transfer due to his work in \"trying to stop the child separations.\"\nMerkley has been a vocal opponent of the government\u2019s \"zero-tolerance\" immigration policy that led to the separation of more than 2,000 children from their parents as they entered the United States illegally or at ports of entries. Many of them came seeking asylum. Parents separated from their children were sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers, and their children were sent to the care of another federal agency.\n\"Just as hurricane season is starting, it generally starts June 1st, the administration is working hard to find funds for additional detention camps. \u2026 In fact, $10 million comes out of FEMA,\" Merkley told Maddow.\nIs Merkley right that the Trump administration transferred $10 million from FEMA to ICE? The transfer did happen. But the administration contends that appropriations limitations prevented the money from being used for hurricane response. One budget watchdog described the administration\u2019s argument as \"disingenuous at best.\"\nThe \u2018$10 million\u2019 transfer\nMerkley\u2019s claim stems from a fiscal year 2018 \"transfer and reprogramming notifications\" document from the the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS. That department oversees both FEMA and ICE.\nThe document shows that more than $200 million went to ICE from other DHS agencies, and that the money would be used to pay for detention beds and for flights for deported immigrants.\nICE got $9.8 million from FEMA\u2019s Operations and Support account. (The transfer was less than 1 percent of that account\u2019s budget).\nSome of the funds transferred had been labeled for \"Response and Recovery - Recovery\"; \"Mitigation\"; \"Response and Recovery - Response\"; and \"Preparedness and Protection.\"\nDue to the transfer, FEMA would curtail training, travel, public engagement sessions, IT security support and infrastructure maintenance, and investments related to a program to streamline grants\u2019 management, the DHS document said.\nTrump administration response\nDHS press secretary Tyler Q. Houlton pushed back on Merkley\u2019s assessment that the administration was using emergency money for immigration purposes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster,\" Houlton tweeted on Sept. 11.\nUnder no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster.\u2014 Tyler Q. Houlton (@SpoxDHS) September 12, 2018\n\n\nThe transferred money \"is not coming out of the disaster relief fund, it has no impact on our efforts to be prepared for Hurricane Florence,\" FEMA\u2019s administrator Brock Long told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell on Sept. 12.\nMerkley did not say in his tweet or MSNBC interview that the funds came from the disaster relief fund, he broadly said FEMA.\nUnder law, a series of steps typically take place before the federal government taps into FEMA\u2019s disaster relief fund. (Check out our story on how the United States funds disaster recovery.)\nThe administration\u2019s claim that the funds \"couldn\u2019t be used for disaster-related activities is disingenuous at best,\" said Steve Ellis, executive vice president at Taxpayers for Common Sense.\nEllis pointed to FEMA\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2019. That request described FEMA\u2019s Mitigation program (some of its 2018 funds were transferred to ICE) as one whose efforts \"help create safer communities, enable people to recover more rapidly from disasters while relieving financial impacts.\"\nUnder the Response and Recovery program (funds from here were also transferred to ICE), the mission of the Response unit is to \"conduct emergency operations to save lives and property by: positioning emergency equipment, personnel and supplies; evacuating survivors; providing food, water, shelter, and medical care to those in need; and restoring critical public services,\" the budget request said.\nSome transferred funds also came from \"Mission Support\" \u2014 which funds FEMA headquarters activities.\nOur ruling\nMerkley said the Trump administration transferred $10 million from FEMA to ICE.\nDHS, which oversees FEMA and ICE, did transfer nearly $10 million from FEMA to ICE. The immigration agency got the funds to pay for detention beds and for the transportation of immigrants ordered deported.\nA transfer document shows that some of the FEMA money had been marked for response and recovery, mitigation, preparedness and protection. Officials argued that the money didn\u2019t come from the disaster relief fund, but Merkley didn\u2019t say it did, he only said it came from FEMA.\nWe rate Merkley\u2019s claim True.\n Share the Facts 2018-09-13 15:12:46 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  Says the Trump administration transferred $10 million from FEMA to ICE.
