Cory Booker on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation.\nThe Republican-controlled Senate will hold several confirmation hearings for the week of Jan. 10, frustrating Democrats like Booker who say the jam-packed schedule was a move to deflect public attention from Trump\u2019s more controversial nominees. \u00a0\nBut back \"in 2009, Mitch McConnell was the person that\u2019s saying, \u2018Hey, we should have all the ethics information in before we do the hearings.\u2019 I just was reviewing his letter this morning,\" Booker said Jan. 8, emphasizing that rigorous review is perhaps more important for Trump\u2019s nominees given their wealth, international business ties and potential conflicts of interest.\nIs Booker right that McConnell advocated for complete ethical review for Obama\u2019s appointees before holding confirmation hearings?\nBooker\u2019s claim is accurate, though it may be a bit premature to charge McConnell with hypocrisy.\nThe confirmation process \nAll cabinet-level positions as well as scores of senior-level personnel for executive branch agencies must be confirmed by the Senate. (Those who don\u2019t have to be confirmed are positions that solely advise the president.)\nFirst, the president or president-elect selects, vets and submits nominations to the appropriate Senate committees. Then the committees typically hold investigations (using information provided by the White House and their own research) and hearings (for public debate over the nomination). Finally, after review, they report the nominations to the full Senate for a vote on the floor.\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, the clearance stage includes submitting financial disclosure forms, completing background checks and signing ethics agreements that identify and outline ways to mitigate conflicts of interest, reviewed and certified by the Office of Government Ethic. This typically occurs before the nominations are submitted to the Senate. \u00a0\nThe rules for confirmation vary by committee. All review a nominee\u2019s biographical resume and some set of disclosure forms. Some also consult FBI background checks. Again, this information gathering often happens before a hearing, but is more often required before a vote.\nIn a letter released by Senate Democrats, the director of the independent Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, expressed concern that several of Trump\u2019s nominees with scheduled hearings have yet to complete the ethics review process as of Jan. 6, 2017.\n\"I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review,\" Shaub wrote. \"In fact, OGE has not received even the initial draft financial disclosure reports for some of the nominees scheduled for hearings.\"\nOut of the Trump picks with confirmation hearings scheduled, ethics forms have been submitted for attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, defense secretary nominee James Mattis and transportation secretary nominee Elaine Chao, according to the Associated Press.\nIt\u2019s unclear if forms have been submitted for CIA director nominee Rep. Mike Pompeo, homeland security secretary nominee Gen. John Kelly, and housing secretary nominee Ben Carson.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForms have not been submitted for education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos or commerce secretary Wilbur Ross.\nMcConnell\u2019s letter\nExperts agreed with Booker\u2019s characterization of McConnell\u2019s letter, sent to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dated Feb. 12, 2009.\n\"Prior to considering any time agreements on the floor on any nominee,\" McConnell wrote, ranking members expect eight ethical standards to be met.\nAmong them: a completed FBI background check, a completed Office of Government Ethics letter, completed financial disclosure statements (and tax returns where they apply) and a completed committee questionnaires submitted to the respective Senate committees \"prior to a hearing being noticed.\"\nIn layman\u2019s terms, McConnell not only required for \"completion of disclosures but also review prior to floor consideration,\" said Wayne Steger, a political science professor at DePaul University and the author of A Citizen\u2019s Guide to Presidential Nominations.\n\"The ethics review process had to be complete before he would agree to set aside the right to filibuster nominations,\" said Steven Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis and expert on Senate procedure.\nBooker\u2019s office also referred us to a 2009 Roll Call article on McConnell\u2019s letter.\n\"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday threatened to filibuster any of President Barack Obama\u2019s executive branch nominations if they do not meet what he deemed a series of \u2018standards\u2019 for installment,\" the article reads (full version here).\nMcConnell\u2019s office, meanwhile, argued that Booker mischaracterized the letter. McConnell\u2019s communications director David Popp pointed out that by the time McConnell sent\u00a0letter on Feb. 12,\u00a0the Senate had already held hearings for everyone Obama nominated.\u00a0This is accurate, and all but one of the 13 nominees was confirmed before Feb. 12.\n\"If you read the letter, it simply calls for continuing the best practices and precedents of the Senate \u2014 it does not ask for new preconditions the way Sen. Booker and other Democrats are now doing, such as calling for the tax returns of all nominees, rather than only in those committees that regularly request returns,\" he said.\nAppearing right before Booker on Face the Nation, McConnell dismissed concerns from Democrats as sour grapes disguised as \"little procedural complaints\" and emphasized the need to get Trump\u2019s national security team up and running on day one. He suggested his ethical standards hadn\u2019t changed and said there is still time to comply.\nAfter all, \"we are still in the process of getting the papers in. I think at least five of the nominees have all of their papers in,\" he said. \"The real thing is the vote on the floor, and we want to have all of the records in, all of the papers completed before they are actually confirmed on the Senate floor.\"\nThe ruling\nBooker said, \"In 2009, Mitch McConnell was the person that\u2019s saying, 'Hey, we should have all the ethics information in before we do the hearings.' \"\nMcConnell wrote\u00a0a letter on Feb. 12, 2009 that advocated for completion of disclosure forms before hearings and as a condition of floor consideration. But most of the the people Obama nominated by the time of McConnell's letter\u00a0had already been approved.\nWe rate Booker\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03813"}
