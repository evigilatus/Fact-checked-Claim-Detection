Trainor, \u00a0aired on Sept. 1, 2011 on WPRO\u2019s \"The Buddy Cianci Show.\"\n\nBecause it wasn\u2019t the first time that Cianci had made the comment -- and because a bankruptcy judge had \"discharged\" most of Trainor\u2019s debt nearly a year ago -- we thought it was worth looking into.\n\nTrainor has built a career in public relations representing some of the state\u2019s high-profile politicians and corporate players. He was an advisor and spokesman for Lincoln Chafee during Chafee\u2019s successful 2010 run for governor.\n\nBut Trainor has had his own public relations problems ever since it became known late last year that he and a business partner from Connecticut defaulted on a $250,000 federal small business loan granted through the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation.\n\nAccording to the EDC and bankruptcy court documents, \u00a0here\u2019s what happened:\n\nThe duo and two of their partners started a Rhode Island company, called Genesis Distribution & Marketing, in 2006 to distribute and market retractable window screens and hurricane shutters.\n\nTrainor and his partners had already bought a company in Connecticut that distributed and installed hurricane shutters. And they planned to buy three more in the South that made the shutters. In January 2007, the EDC loaned \u00a0the business $250,000 through the federally funded Small Business Loan Fund to buy inventory, furniture, fixtures and equipment and hire three employees.\n\nBut the business was short-lived.\n\nJust two months after receiving the EDC loan, the partners fell behind on their payments. In 2008, the company folded.\n\nTrainor and his partner from Connecticut, who had pledged their homes as collateral for the loan, talked with representatives from the EDC about a settlement. But the talks broke off in August 2009, when Trainor notified the agency that he was filing for bankruptcy.\n\nBy then, the housing market had tanked along with the value of Trainor\u2019s house. \u00a0\n\nThe partners had repaid $36,326 of the loan; with interest and late fees, the debt on the loan at the time totaled $250,723.\n\nIn September 2010, a bankruptcy judge granted Trainor\u2019s petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nAn explanation of the ruling in the bankruptcy court documents states: \"The chapter 7 discharge order eliminates a debtor's legal obligation to pay a debt that is discharged.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe EDC loan was written off on Nov. 30, 2010. The agency concluded that it couldn\u2019t recover any money from its lien on Trainor\u2019s home because the mortgage balance exceeded the property\u2019s value.\n\nIn December, 2010, Trainor, who was being considered for a job in the Chafee administration, told The Providence Journal that he had not walked away from his obligations, saying he\u2019d like to negotiate a settlement with the EDC.\n\nGovernor Chafee discussed Trainor\u2019s situation on Channel 12 \"Newsmakers\" in December 2010, saying that there would be an effort made to repay the EDC. \"[We\u2019ll] make sure Mike does that,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSo it certainly sounded then as though Chafee and even Trainor himself believed that Trainor still owed the EDC the money. \u00a0\n\nChafee hired Trainor as spokesman when he took office in January, a job that paid $129,235.\n\nThat month, Trainor also repaid the state $20,788.75 in taxes -- which were not \u00a0dischargeable in the bankruptcy -- owed on his failed business. In return, the state Division of Taxation removed the lien on his property.\n\nSix months later, in July, the bank sold his house at a foreclosure auction.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrainor served seven months as Chafee\u2019s spokesman before he was transferred, in August, to the Department of Higher Education. His salary has dropped to $88,177.\n\nSo, does he still owe the $250,000, as Cianci claims?\n\n\"That debt was discharged,\u2019\u2019 Andrew S. Richardson, a lawyer and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Trustee in the Trainor case, said. \"(He) can no longer be forced to pay the obligation -- nor can the creditor take any steps to try and collect it.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn other words, Richardson said, there\u2019s no legal obligation that Trainor repay the loan.\n\nBut other lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy see it differently.\n\n\"Most people understand (bankruptcy) as destroying the debt \u2026 but technically the discharge in bankruptcy doesn\u2019t destroy the debt at all,\u2019\u2019 Jason Kilborn, a lawyer, law professor and resident scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute in Virginia said. \"It does not destroy the obligation from a moral or even a legal obligation. It just prevents the creditors from collecting on that debt.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe American Bankruptcy Institute was founded in 1982 to provide Congress and the public with unbiased analysis of bankruptcy issues.\n\nIn other words, the debt remains, even though the creditors are forced to write it off as uncollectable.\n\nSo if the debt remains but Trainor isn\u2019t obligated to repay it, does he really \"owe\" the state money?\n\nWe called Cianci and challenged him on his use of the term \"owes.\" \u00a0Trainor\u2019s bankruptcy discharge, he maintained, doesn\u2019t change the fact that Trainor still owes the EDC the $250,000.\n\n\"Maybe it was discharged,\u2019\u2019 he said, \"but in the mind of the taxpayer who fronted the 250 grand? Yeah, he still owes it.\"\n\nSaid Richardson, the trustee: \"I think it depends on whose point of view you\u2019re looking at, the creditor or the debtor.\u2019\u2019\n\nWe agree.\n\nPractically speaking, the bankruptcy ruling and the fact that the mortgage on the Trainor\u2019s home exceeded its value made it impossible for the EDC to recoup its money.\n\nBut even after the debt was discharged in bankruptcy Trainor and Chafee both said they\u2019d make an effort made to repay the EDC.\n\nAfter all, a debt can be owed even if it\u2019s never collected.\n\nFor that reason, we rule Cianci\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12443"}
