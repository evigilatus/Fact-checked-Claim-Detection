She declined to elaborate aside from referring to the campaign\u2019s Wisconsin lawsuit.\nBut that lawsuit makes clear Trump was attempting to refer to in-person absentee voting \u2014 that\u2019s the only element of his Wisconsin claims related to ballot applications. One of the four primary allegations in the complaint was that \"at least 170,140 absentee ballots were improperly counted as they were issued without the elector having first submitted a written application.\"\nThat total is the number of in-person absentee votes cast in Milwaukee and Dane counties combined, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Those are the two heavily Democratic counties in which the Trump campaign paid for a recount and is now suing.\nSo Trump meant to say 170,000, not 70,000.\nBut that\u2019s the least of his issues with the truth.\nYes, absentee voters filled out an application\nWisconsinites casting a traditional absentee vote do that by applying for a ballot by mail or through the MyVote.wi.gov website. But in-person absentee ballots simplify this down to a single form \u2014 an \"absentee ballot application/certification\" located on the envelope that holds the absentee ballot.\nTrump\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 in line with verbiage from the speech \u2014 claims those in-person absentee ballots were filed without \"written application as expressly required by Wis. Stat. \u00a7 6.86(1)(ar).\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that statute doesn\u2019t include specific requirements.\nThat reference in state law simply says municipal clerks shouldn\u2019t issue an absentee ballot \"unless the clerk receives a written application therefor (sic) from a qualified elector of the municipality.\" It details no requirements for what that application should include.\nReid Magney, spokesman for the state elections commission, confirmed there are no requirements in state law on the nature of absentee ballot applications, leaving that detail to the commission to decide. And the commission has required an application for every ballot.\n\"To claim that there is no application on file for these absentee ballots is false,\" Magney said.\nThe commission created the combined certificate and application in 2010 after complaints following the 2008 presidential election that in-person absentee voting was inefficient and involved too much paperwork.\u00a0\nThe Government Accountability Board (predecessor to the elections commission) studied the matter and issued a lengthy report in December 2009. It created the combined form on the envelope of the absentee ballot after holding listening sessions and consulting with clerks around the state.\nA memo sent to clerks in May 2010 explained the change this way: \"The title of the certificate has changed to indicate that it also serves as an application for in-person absentee voters. A line has been added (\"I further certify that I requested this ballot.\") to make the document an application.\nThis process \u2014 where early voters fill out an envelope application \u2014 has been used throughout Wisconsin (though not exclusively) since the 2016 election where Trump narrowly carried the state. We should also note this change was implemented at a time when Republicans controlled all of state government.\nIt was a heavily-used approach in this year\u2019s mid-pandemic election. Early in-person votes accounted for 23.7% of all ballots in Milwaukee County and 17.7% in Dane County, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis of voting data from the elections commission. Statewide, nearly 700,000 people voted this way in the November election.\nOur ruling\nTrump claims in his speech (and a lawsuit) that \"70,000 absentee ballots that do not have matching ballot applications as required by law.\"\nEvery part of this is wrong.\nTrump was actually referring to a group of 170,000 votes, not 70,000.\nAnd that group of in-person absentee voters did indeed fill out an application in order to cast their ballot. It was part of the ballot certificate on the envelope, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less valid since state statute doesn\u2019t specify the nature of that application.\nIt\u2019s the same approach that\u2019s been used without issue in Wisconsin elections since 2010 \u2014 including the 2016 presidential contest that Trump won.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17263"}
