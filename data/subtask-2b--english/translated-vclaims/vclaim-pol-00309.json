However, the trends of low rates of marriage and extramarital births began before the legalization of same-sex marriages. ..................................................................................... Lee Padget, an economist at Massachusetts Amherst University and Director of Research at the Williams Institute of Sexual Orientation and Public Policy of the University of California, wrote a detailed study which examined marriage and birth rates in Scandinavian countries. \"The rates of marriage, divorce, and non-marital birth rates in Scandinavia, Europe and the United States have changed over the past 30 years,\" by Badjit. \"But those changes occurred in all countries, regardless of whether or not same-sex partnership laws were adopted, and these trends were taking place before laws giving same-sex couples rights were enacted.\" In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, same-sex partnerships were legalized in 1989, 1993 and 1994, respectively. In general, gay partners in these countries enjoy legal and financial protection for marriage, but are not allowed to marry in church or adopt children. The special Charlie Kirk, a fact checker, mentioned on January 26, 2021 at Instagram. By Daniel Funk: January 28, 2021, statistics at the county level indicate Brownback on virgin births are correct, as Badget said, but this trend also began years before the legalization of homosexual relations. Governor Stanley Kurtz is a prominent advocate of the argument that same-sex marriage is harmful to marriage between the sexes. Kurtz responded to the Padjit study by claiming that marriage rates in Scandinavia and other European countries were still declining, and that the legalization of same-sex partnerships was \"retrogression of forces and intensification of parental coexistence.\" But even Kurtz admits that the decline began before legitimating same-sex relationships. :: Editor &apos; s note: This statement was estimated to be barely correct when it was published.
