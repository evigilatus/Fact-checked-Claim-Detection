She was repeatedly asked as Secretary of State to provide security. Paul told CNN the state of Union host Candy Crowley on May 19, 2013, including in \"direct cable.\" Crowley asked Paul about his recent comments in Iowa and New Hampshire that Clinton's failure should keep her away from the presidency. \"It's that you did it in Iowa or New Hampshire that gives him a political heiress, and I ask you if you think it's useful,\" she said. Paul answered, \"You know, I've done it in every state and every stop because I think it's very important that you accept the blame for not providing security. They have been repeatedly asked to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions, including direct cables, and say they have never read the cables through security. I find this unforgivable and a failure of duty. \"Whether it has political expressions or not, it really goes to the heart of who you are the Secretary of State if you don't provide security for the embassy that begs for it, Did Clinton itself receive repeated requests for security before an armed terrorist attack, including in \"direct cable\"? Paul's cable office 101 said that Clinton's name on diplomatic cables proves that she was or should have been involved in security decisions. \"It may be more damned to charge Clinton if it's true, because her lack of interest in her job may cost the lives of United States citizens abroad,\" said Moira Bagley, Paul's spokesman. She referred to an allegation by Republicans in the House of Representatives, reported by the Los Angeles Times in April, that a cable signed by Clinton had proposed security cuts in Benghazi before the attack. \"Signature of Clinton is on this cable and others,\" said Bagley. \"If Minister Clinton signs a telegram to limit security, then her signature is strong evidence that she reads cables.\" (Bagley did not provide evidence that Clinton \"was repeatedly asked to provide security,\" including \"direct cables.\" But we'll be there in a minute.) First, is Clinton's \"signature\" strong evidence of her personal involvement? Let us talk for a moment about diplomatic cables. It is considered to be a message sent through a new e-mail system - called \"Cable Express\" - based on some old school habits. How old is school? The messages are also called \"televisions.\" The Foreign Affairs Manual of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs contains all types of rules and instructions concerning the formulation, formation, processing and dispatch of such items. We have gone through several parts of the Handbook of Correspondence, and we have learned interesting statues, such as, \"If you send a telegram from mail to the department or to other mail, enter, respectively, \"SECSTATE WASHDC\"; or the graph of the other function (for example). \"Amambosi Berlin, Amnosol Chiang Mai in the sender's field.\" Here's what we've learned. If you send a telegram \"to mail from the department\" - so, let's say, to a certain embassy from Washington, D.C. - you send it to the post, bearing the name of the Secretary of State. This is true: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Communications Centre places the Minister's name \"on all telegrams to mail.\" When Clinton was in charge, it meant that the \"signature\" of the telegrams was hers. That doesn't mean she signed it, but her name was printed downstairs. For this reason, when Rebe Daryl Issa, R. Califf, argued on television in April, Clinton personally signed a telegram on the reduction of United States security personnel in Benghazi, Washington Post, Glen Kessler, who covered the State Department for nine years, he was called \"the shopper.\" Deputy Elijah Cummings, D-MD, confirmed that the evaluation was conducted in May, saying: \"We have now seen this cable and have not signed it. Her name is printed down there just like tens of thousands of cables sent every year from the department.\" But as we mentioned earlier, Paul's claim was that letters were sent in the other direction, from an American embassy to Washington. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for incineration security, and said to her, \"We are not working for you.\" To the \"registry\" in the \"WashDC.\" While the cable to \"SECSTATE\" may look like a \"direct cable\" to the Secretary of State, the reality is somewhat less exciting. \"SCSTATE,\" according to another part of the Foreign Affairs Manual, is the \"location index\" of the entire Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Peace Corps. About 1.4 million cables per year are handled in this way. How Clinton explained this to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives in January: \"All are addressed to me. They didn't all come to me. They are reported through bureaucracy.\" She said that requests for security from Libya had never come to her attention. \"I didn't know it was happening,\" she said. \"I have not been drawn to my attention, but it is clearly something we are fixing and we intend to develop protocols and systems to ensure that it does not happen again.\" Therefore, Clinton's name or address on millions of diplomatic cables does not say much about whether they are personally familiar with their contents. In the case of Benghazi security, she testified under oath that she had not done so. However, clear repeated requests were made to Washington. A report issued by the Accountability Review Board of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in December 2012 indicated that the number of diplomatic security officers in Benghazi on the day of the attack was insufficient despite \"recurring requests... for additional staff.\" The Council focused its attention on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and concluded that \"some senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within two offices have shown a lack of proactive leadership and managerial capacity in responding to the security concerns raised by the Benghazi Special Mission, given the deteriorating threat environment and the lack of reliable protection from the host Government.\" However, she did not find a reasonable reason to determine that anyone had violated his duty. The Republicans in the House of Representatives issued their interim report in April and criticized the Review Council &apos; s focus on lower-level officials. He states that in the months prior to the attack, officials from the United States Mission in Libya stressed the insufficient security and the need for more personnel in \"many contacts.\" The Republicans &apos; report refers in particular to two telegrams and two e-mails, from March, April, June and July 2012, which reflect noon and immediately where diplomats asked for more American security personnel, but Washington officials said no. They preferred to train Libyan security personnel. None of the messages contain Clinton - except that one carries its \"signature,\" as any Kabul does outside Washington. However, some recent testimonies before the oversight committee of the Chamber of Deputies indicated that there were some expectations that should have been familiar with the discussion. Eric Nordstrom, former Regional Security Officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Libya, drafted some cables from the Embassy to request more security, including those from March mentioned by the Republicans. He testified before legislators on 8 May 2013 and said that Clinton was expected to read or be informed of that cable. \"I certainly expected (that) because of the fact that she was involved in the security operation,\" he said. She had to personally approve the security teams of the Ministry of Defence that had been deployed and witnessed Nordstrom - teams that he had been asked to keep in Kabul in March. \"I also went out to the site, walked through our facilities, walked through the facilities, and watched the insecurity there - something that was her country team - or was briefed by the country team during its visit to the site.\" However, when asked by legislators whether the Foreign Ministry Review Board allowed anyone to break the impasse, he referred to the Under-Secretary of the Department, Patrick Kennedy, instead of Clinton. \"I think she has a very reasonable assurance that some of these cases have not been brought to her attention,\" said Nordstrom. \"Well, how can we fix that until the Foreign Minister's attention is drawn? I wasn't lost being an ungentlemanly messenger this time. Look where those letters seem to stop, the Under Secretary of State for Management. \"There seems to be something wrong in the process of how to bring those security recommendations to the secretary,\" he said. Our judgment, Paul, blamed Clinton for Benghazi's security failures, saying, \"She has been repeatedly asked to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions, including direct cables.\" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly been asked to appoint additional United States security personnel in Libya. But we see no evidence that Clinton herself was aware of those requests. For example, there is no \"direct cable\" that automatically appears on the Office of the Secretary of State. Instead, all cables had their name, and only those who passed through the chain had access to it by the employees. She says this wasn't. At the same time, the same security officer who testified that he was expected to be briefed on his request for additional staff also said, \"There seems to be something wrong in the process of how to make those security recommendations to the secretary.\" Paul &apos; s office did not provide evidence directly linking security requests to Clinton. We just found evidence that the applications were filed by her department. We're mostly assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09306"}
