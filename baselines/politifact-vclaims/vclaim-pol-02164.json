Facebook also restored it.", "text": "U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, fresh from questioning Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at a hearing, asserted that Facebook inappropriately killed an appreciation day for Chick-Fil-A, the chicken restaurant that serves customers in more than 150 Texas places.\nWe hadn\u2019t heard that before. Was Facebook down with that?\nCruz\u2019s April 11, 2018, commentary on the Fox News website centered on what the Texas Republican described as Facebook\u2019s suppression of conservative news stories and the like, making Facebook, Cruz wrote, far from a neutral public forum--a critique that Zuckerberg hadn't embraced.\nCruz put Facebook\u2019s suppression of chicken appreciation\u00a0this way: \"Facebook\u2019s actions have ranged from seemingly petty things \u2013 like shutting down a \u2018Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day\u2019 to blocking posts from journalists, specific religious groups and most recently, grassroots Trump supporters Diamond and Silk,\" Cruz asserted.\nCruz cites 2012 account\nAsked the basis of Cruz\u2019s Chick-Fil-A claim, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier provided a web link to a July 2012 Huffington Post news story that said that for some time over perhaps two days, a Facebook \"events\" page urging people to patronize Chick-Fil-A had been taken offline.\nAccording to the story, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee created the page -- urging Aug. 1, 2012, visits to the chain -- because he was upset that Chick-Fil-A was the target of criticism in the wake of Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy\u2019s saying that \"his company supports \u2018the biblical definition of the family unit.\u2019\"\nWe saw that the HuffPo story mentioning Huckabee\u2019s Facebook events page touting the intended appreciation day debuted at 10:09 a.m. July 24, 2012. Nearly eight hours later, a 5:55 p.m. update of the story quoted Huckabee saying the page had been yanked down that morning.\n\"The Facebook event is no longer available,\" HuffPo reported, \"and Gov. Huckabee has written the following on his Facebook page: \u2018A number of you are asking questions about the Chick Fil-A event. The event disappeared from my page this morning and we have asked Facebook to look into this. I will update you as soon as I know more. The event is still on and the info should be back up soon.\u2019\"\nThe next day, at an unspecified time, the HuffPo story was updated to say: \"The Facebook event is back and more than 125,000 people have signed up to participate.\"\nHuckabee said on the restored Facebook events page, which was live when we started to fact-check Cruz\u2019s claim:\n\"I ask you to join me in speaking out on Wednesday, August 1 \u2018Chick Fil-A Appreciation Day.\u2019 No one is being asked to make signs, speeches, or openly demonstrate. The goal is simple: Let's affirm a business that operates on Christian principles and whose executives are willing to take a stand for the Godly values we espouse by simply showing up and eating at Chick Fil-A on Wednesday, August 1. Too often, those on the left make corporate statements to show support for same sex marriage, abortion, or profanity, but if Christians affirm traditional values, we\u2019re considered homophobic, fundamentalists, hate-mongers, and intolerant. This effort is not being launched by the Chick Fil-A company and no one from the company or family is involved in proposing or promoting it.\n\"There's no need for anyone to be angry or engage in a verbal battle. Simply affirm appreciation for a company run by Christian principles by showing up on Wednesday, August 1 or by participating online \u2013 tweeting your support or sending a message on Facebook.\"\nAfter Cruz made his claim, we reached out to Huckabee and didn\u2019t hear back. But Huckabee specified in a July 25, 2012, Facebook post pointed out to us by Frazier that the Facebook page he\u2019d created to talk up Chick-Fil-A had been taken down for 12 hours. It seems, Huckabee wrote then, \"we caught a 12 hour bug\u2026 We still aren\u2019t sure why it happened, we have been told by Facebook \u2018it was a mistake,\u2019 clearly we think it was a mistake too but aren\u2019t so convinced it was an accident.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Could it be,\" Huckabee went on, that \"we were were attacked because of our beliefs? Could it be that Facebook has a glitch in their system with a VERY NARROW target? Who knows if we will ever know for sure, but one thing we do know for sure is that we are back up and running\u2026\" Huckabee\u2019s post closed: \"So we got knocked down, but hey! WE ARE BACK UP!\"\nThe page\u2019s temporary vanishment evidently didn\u2019t stop the appreciation day. According to the Facebook events page launched by Huckabee, some 653,000 people participated that day.\nFacebook responds\nWe also asked Facebook and Chick-Fil-A about the accuracy of Cruz\u2019s claim.\nBy email, Facebook spokeswoman Sarah Pollack responded that the events page devoted to celebrating Chick-Fil-A was \"mistakenly removed by our automated systems after we received a report that content on the page violated our policies.\" Pollack went on: \"The event did not violate our policies and we worked to restore it as soon as we were aware. The event page was restored within ten hours and is still live today.\"\nAsked which policies were at issue, Pollack replied that she didn\u2019t have more detail because the event page \"didn\u2019t violate any of our policies.\" See Facebook\u2019s \"community standards\" policies here.\nWe also heard back from Jackie Jags, a Chick-Fil-A spokeswoman. Jags advised by email that the one-time appreciation day \"was not initiated by the company.\"\nWe told Frazier, of Cruz\u2019s campaign, that we\u2019d learned that Facebook restored Huckabee\u2019s pro-Chick-Fil-A page within 12 hours and that it looked like the declared appreciation day occurred after all.\nBy email, Frazier reiterated that the page was initially yanked off-line by Facebook. Cruz\u2019s claims about Facebook, she wrote, \"are based in fact.\"\nOur ruling\nCruz wrote that Facebook shut down a \"Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day.\"\nThis claim delivers only half the bird--we mean, story.\nIn 2012, Facebook says, it responded to an objection by removing an events page encouraging turnout at Chick-Fil-A restaurants. But the appreciation day page didn\u2019t violate Facebook\u2019s community standards,\u00a0the company says, and it was put back online within 12 hours; the celebration occurred after all.\nOn balance, we rate Cruz\u2019s claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
