Our opponents will create and spread outrageous lies to try to stop President Obama from creating real change. 2. We just can't count on the media to debunk them.\"\n\n\nThe e-mail asks for cash contributions to help Organizing for America fight back.\n\n\n\"Stepping in when the media fails is a daunting challenge,\" Stewart writes, \"But this community has already come together and accomplished feats no one thought possible. ... Please donate today to get the truth out.\"\n\n\nLest we be accused of\n\ntooting\n\n\nour\n\n\nown\n\n\nhorn\n\nhere, we'll confine ourselves to a review of some of the\n\nother\n\nmedia coverage of the health reform battle.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactcheck.org has debunked many false claims, including an e-mail analysis of\n\nwhat's in a bill\n\nbeing considered in the House of Representatives, as well as a list of \"\n\nseven big myths\n\n\" about health reform.\n\n\nCNN's \"Truth Squad\" has\u00a0 looked at whether you have to go blind\n\nin one eye\n\nbefore getting eye care (wrong!) and many other false claims about health care. The Truth Squad cataloged all their fact-checks on their\n\nPolitical Ticker blog\n\n.\n\n\nThere's also the Associated Press. They reported several fact-checking pieces, including looking at claims\n\nObama has made\n\n, as well as claims about\n\neuthanasia\n\nand\n\nillegal immigrants\n\n.\n\n\nCQ Politics\n\nreported a story\n\non whether health care would be rationed, whether employees could be automatically enrolled in a public plan, and whether the government would have real-time access to bank accounts, among other things. Nope, nope and nope.\n\n\nWe could go on (and on), but you get the picture. There is no shortage of reporting on false claims about health care.\n\n\nWe know, based on our own reader e-mail, that there is still a lot of confusion about health care reform and what it entails, including among those who are truly undecided. And we've also heard from readers who have negative, factually incorrect ideas about health care reform and don't want to be argued out of their beliefs.\n\n\nMitch Stewart of Organizing for America might not like the fact that some Americans remain unconvinced. They also probably don't like it that town halls during August have been packed with people making erroneous claims, or that some pundits think Obama is losing the debate over health care.\n\n\nBut for Organizing for America to say that the media isn't debunking false claims about health care is wrong -- demonstrably wrong. In fact, it's laughably delusional. We rate their statement Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15607"}
