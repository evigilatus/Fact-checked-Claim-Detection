Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, declared in an opinion column on CNN.com: \"The growing number of foreign websites that offer counterfeit or stolen goods continues to threaten American technology, products and jobs.\"\n\nHis Jan. 20, 2012, post continues: \"Illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion and thousands of jobs every year. Congress cannot stand by and do nothing while some of America's most profitable and productive industries are under attack.\"\n\nSay what costs that much? A reader asked.\n\nSmith\u2019s $100 billion statement has weaknesses, we learned, partly because estimates of the impact of online vending of counterfeit or pirated (as in stolen) software, movies, recordings and other rip-off products ranging from handbags to shoes are hard to corral.\n\nWe\u2019ll dip into Smith\u2019s backup after some background.\n\nSmith is a chief sponsor of the stalled Stop Online Piracy Act, which he described in a November 2011 Austin American-Statesman oped column as an attempt to rein in \"a vast virtual market online run by criminals who steal and sell America's intellectual property and keep the profits for themselves.\"\n\n\"Movies and music are not the only stolen products that are offered by rogue sites,\" Smith\u2019s column says. \"Counterfeit medicine, automotive parts and even baby food are a big part of the counterfeiting business and pose a serious threat to the health of American consumers.\"\n\nSmith\u2019s November column says too that the act is intended to target such illegal activity by permitting the attorney general to seek an injunction against a foreign website dedicated to it.\n\nCongressional action on Smith\u2019s proposal, and a Senate approach pitched as protecting intellectual property, stalled out in the wake of a public outcry in January.\n\nNow let\u2019s get back to Smith\u2019s claim that counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion a year.\n\nHis spokeswoman, Sally-Shannon Birkel, told us Smith\u2019s figure originated in a February 2011 report commissioned by the France-based Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy, an initiative of the International Chamber of Commerce, whose declared mission is to promote trade and investment, open markets and the free flow of capital.\n\nThe report says: \"We find that the U.S. consumption-based share of counterfeit and pirated goods is between $66 billion and $100 billion (based on 2008 data).\" So that\u2019s the origin of Smith\u2019s $100 billion figure. It\u2019s the high-end part of this finding.\n\nGlobally, the same report says, such goods had a 2008 value of up to $650 billion.\n\nBut Smith\u2019s statement refers to how much counterfeiting and online piracy costs the U.S. economy. \u00a0Is the country\u2019s \"consumption-based share\" of such goods -- which the report calls relevant to U.S. businesses -- the same as their cost to the economy?\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely. A portion of the report pointed out to us by Sanjay Jain, a Texas A&M University professor of marketing, states that the \"study has not attempted to estimate business losses associated with counterfeiting and piracy. This is primarily because the likely variations and other difficulties associated with estimating substitution effects across substantially different countries and industries introduces an additional level/degree of variables which could undermine our aim to as accurately as possible characterize the magnitude of counterfeiting and piracy.\"\n\nAfter presenting the $66 billion to $100 billion range, the report says this represents \"international trade in counterfeit and pirated goods, domestically produced and consumed goods and digitally pirated products.\" Broken down, the report says, this includes consumption of $45 billion to $60 billion of internationally traded counterfeit and pirated products, $12 billion to $14 billion in domestically produced counterfeit products and between $9 billion and $25 billion in digitally pirated products.\n\nJain and Julian Sanchez, a fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who has urged skepticism about cost estimates for online piracy, each pointed out to us that the presented range questionably assumes that any pirated product would otherwise be purchased at its retail price by the person who obtained it. That\u2019s not always or even often so, they said.\n\nBroadly speaking, Jain said, he has seen no convincing studies on the costs of piracy and counterfeiting to the American economy \u2014 unsurprisingly so, he said, \u00a0because it\u2019s not an easy problem. \"I don\u2019t know the right number,\" he said.\n\nSanchez, who told us he considers Smith\u2019s proposal a \"bad bill,\" raised another issue, saying by email that most of the pirated and counterfeited products included in the its $66 billion to $100 billion range have nothing to do with online piracy targeted by Smith\u2019s act.\n\n\"People were manufacturing fake Nikes long before the Internet became a mass medium,\" Sanchez wrote, \"so while it might be an interesting factoid to know the size of that market, it\u2019s a red herring if we\u2019re talking about a \u2018Stop Online Piracy Act.\u2019\"\n\nThis \"whole debate,\" Sanchez said, \"has tended to lump together \u2018counterfeiting\u2019 (trademark infringement, usually involving physical goods) and \u2018piracy\u2019 (copyright infringement, encompassing both physical media sales and online digital transfers). From a policy perspective, this is misleading, if not outright deceptive. Whatever amount is spent globally on fake Nikes imported in bulk by retailers, it has very little to do with the debate over policy aimed at shutting down cyberlockers to reduce illicit downloads by individual consumers. \u00a0You might as well cite an estimate of the total economic cost of \u2018crime.\u2019 \"\n\nThe debate aside, we asked Jeffrey Hardy, director of the international chamber\u2019s initiative, if its report\u2019s $66 billion to $100 billion estimate for the United States\u2019 \"consumption-based share\" for counterfeit and pirated goods is the same as the economic impact of such activities on the country\u2019s economy.\n\nIt\u2019s not, Hardy said, though he said the cost to the economy would be a percentage of the $66 billion to $100 billion \"share.\" He also stressed that the report\u2019s figures reflected the situation in 2008 and costs have increased since then. His speculation: \"We may already be to $166 billion\" for the U.S. share of consumed counterfeit and pirated goods, which could even turn out to be the current annual cost to the economy.\n\nHardy also confirmed that the range presented in the report is tied to the retail value of goods though, he agreed, it\u2019s incorrect to assume that in all cases someone who purchases a pirated or counterfeit good would otherwise buy the product at market cost.\n\nAll told, Hardy acknowledged, there was no way to pinpoint costs to the economy. The main point was to show that counterfeiting and digital piracy are big problems. \"There is a balance between overhyping or overcooking the pie \u2026 and trying to present the fact that the magnitudes are enormous and getting bigger, especially on the digital side of things,\" Hardy said. \"It\u2019s a very complicated process when there\u2019s not a lot of information and (there is) a lot of educated guesses. That\u2019s what economists do.\" Hardy said the international chamber has taken no position on SOPA.\n\nSeparately, Sanchez said he agrees with an April 2010 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which states that while counterfeiting and online piracy may pose sizeable negative economic effects, they are hard to quantify.\n\nA GAO summary of the report, \"Intellectual Property, Observations on Efforts to Quantify the Economic Effects of Counterfeit and Pirated Goods,\" says: \"Generally, the illicit nature of counterfeiting and piracy makes estimating the economic impact of (intellectual property) infringements extremely difficult, so assumptions must be used to offset the lack of data. Efforts to estimate losses involve assumptions such as the rate at which consumers would substitute counterfeit for legitimate products, which can have enormous impacts on the resulting estimates. Because of the significant differences in types of counterfeited and pirated goods and industries involved, no single method can be used to develop estimates. Each method has limitations, and most experts observed that it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the economy-wide impacts.\"\n\nAfter we summarized much of this research, Smith objected to Sanchez as an expert, saying in an email that \u00a0because Sanchez is opposed to the anti-online-piracy act, he \"cannot provide an objective or unbiased analysis.\" He stood by his CNN.com statement, telling us: \"Since the U.S. is the largest producer of (intellectual property) that is consumed around the world, one can surmise that a significant amount of that total value is taken from the U.S. economy.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nSmith\u2019s statement draws on a high-end estimate also based on flawed assumptions for the U.S. \"consumption-based share of counterfeit and pirated goods\" in 2008. The cited $100 billion figure doesn\u2019t reflect the costs to the economy, contrary to Smith\u2019s claim; the 2011 study did not assess such costs, which are understandably slippery.\n\nMaybe there is no solid estimate of the cost to the economy. Smith\u2019s CNN.com statement rates False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11656"}
