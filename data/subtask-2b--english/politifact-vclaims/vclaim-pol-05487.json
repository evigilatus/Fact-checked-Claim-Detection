This is a time for men and women who are ready to confront our challenges with humility and with purpose.\"\nHold on; Texas is growing two times as fast as the other 49 states combined?\nBy email, Straus spokesman Jason Embry pointed toward U.S. Census Bureau data as the basis of the claim.\nTexas\u2019s population growth\nAccording to the Census breakdown, from April 2010 to July 2014, the U.S. population grew 3.3 percent. According to the data, Texas\u2019 population grew 7.2 percent, which breaks out, Embry noted, to Texas growing twice as fast as the nation.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for us to identify more recent Census data covering national and state population estimates through June 2015. Then again, that information was released Dec. 22, 2015, shortly after Straus unveiled his video -- so he wouldn\u2019t have had access to it.\nRegardless, the latest figures show Texas more than doubling the nation\u2019s growth rate from April 2010 to July 2015 when the population of Texas grew 9.2 percent while the U.S. population grew 4.1 percent.\nNot that Texas was the fastest-growing state in the period; that distinction goes to North Dakota, which saw 12.5 \u00a0percent population growth, the bureau says.\nTexas compared to the rest of the country \nWe recognized, though, that the offered basis of the speaker\u2019s claim compares Texas to the nation as a whole. That\u2019s not what Straus said; he compared Texas to the rest of the nation not including Texas.\nSo, does the growth of Texas double the growth of the rest of the country?\nYou bet your boots, we confirmed, both if you look at growth from 2010 to 2014, the period singled out by Straus, and at shorter time periods.\nWe got out our calculator and found that from mid-2013 to mid-2014, Texas grew by 1.8 percent; that rate was more than double the 0.7 population growth in the rest of the country.\nFrom April 2010 through July 2014, according to bureau data, the population of the rest of the country increased 2.9 percent (while Texas grew, as noted above, 7.2 percent). Throw in growth from mid-2014 to mid-2015, and the rest of the nation grew 3.6 percent over five-plus years (while Texas saw 9.2 percent population increase).\nTexas compared to other individual states\nThere\u2019s another way to make such comparisons -- state to state. And while North Dakota, not Texas, has lately been the fastest-growing state, Texas has ranked among the very fastest-growth states.From 2010 to 2014, year to year, Texas consistently ranked as one of the \u00a0fastest-growing states. From mid-2014 to mid- 2015, only North Dakota, Colorado, Nevada and Florida grew faster than the Lone Star State. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nYear to Year Percentage Changes in Population, Fastest-Growing States\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n2010\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2013\n\n\n2014\n\n\n2015\n\n\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\n0.29\n\n\n1.60\n\n\n2.47\n\n\n3.04\n\n\n2.27\n\n\n2.28\n\n\n\n\nColorado\n\n\n0.38\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.41\n\n\n1.41\n\n\n1.53\n\n\n1.60\n\n\n1.89\n\n\n\n\nNevada\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n1.72\n\n\n1.85\n\n\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n1.36\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n1.25\n\n\n1.59\n\n\n1.84\n\n\n\n\nTexas\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n1.62\n\n\n1.70\n\n\n1.58\n\n\n1.81\n\n\n1.82\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau (NST-EST2015-popchg2010_2015, Jan. 20, 2016)\nIn this recent period, North Dakota was consistently the fastest-growing state; it grew more than 2 percent annually from mid-2012 to mid-2015 and spurted 3 percent from mid-2012 to mid-2013.\nWhy is Texas growing? \nIt doesn\u2019t bear on the accuracy of the speaker\u2019s claim, but we wondered why Texas remains fast-growing.\nBy phone, Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, said much of the state\u2019s growth reflects net migration, the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the state in a given period of time. Potter also said migration to Texas had been driven by job opportunities in the state.\n\"People move to one place or another, usually because they\u2019re looking for work,\" Potter said. \"There\u2019s a small percentage of migration behavior that\u2019s related to say retirement or maybe going to school, but the bulk of movement of people over space is a function of them seeking employment opportunities or leaving a place where there isn\u2019t employment opportunities.\"\nAnother factor playing into the state\u2019s relatively high population increases, Potter said, is a \"fairly healthy\" natural rate of increase, meaning births in Texas outnumbering deaths.\nLike Potter, William Frey, a Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program senior fellow, attributed the growth to fertility rates and domestic migration, as well as immigration.\n\"Texas is unusual because it\u2019s one of the bigger attractions for immigrants in the United States but also has really stood out in term of domestic migration,\" Frey said. \"It\u2019s one of the few states that have a large number of both.\"\nOur Ruling\nStraus said: \"Texas is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country.\"\nCensus Bureau statistics show that Texas, indeed, is growing faster than the United States as a whole. Experts explain that the rate of population growth is due to its birth rate, foreign immigration and migration from other states.\nAlthough Texas is growing faster that the country as a whole, it is not the fastest growing state. Although it ranked second behind North Dakota in 2014, it dropped behind North Dakota, Colorado, Nevada and Florida in 2015, according to data released after Straus published his video.\nWe rate this claim True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05487"}
