Carlos Curbelo of Miami and U.S. Rep. Brian Mast of the Treasure Coast.\nThe politically conservative group has spent $5.6 million on TV, digital and radio advertising campaigns since the House passed the legislation.\nThe ads, which will also run on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, are narrated by a mom who says her family lost their insurance and doctor because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\"But now, we have hope,\" she says. \"House Republicans are keeping their word and fixing our broken health care system: more competition and choices resulting in lower costs and better coverage. Families get tax credits to make insurance cheaper, and people with pre-existing conditions are protected. Thank Congressman Carlos Curbelo for fighting for the better health care we deserve.\"\nWhile AHCA has some language that is intended to protect those with pre-existing conditions, health care experts have previously told us that the legislation would allow insurance companies to charge more for people with pre-existing conditions.\nWe contacted the American Action Network\u2019s spokeswoman but did not get a reply.\nGOP bill would allow insurers to charge more for pre-existing conditions\nThe Affordable Care Act adopted in 2010 prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage \u2014 or charging higher premiums \u2014 because a person has a pre-existing medical condition.\nThe American Health Care Act, as passed by the House, does not approach pre-existing conditions the same way.\nThe literal language of an amendment appears to protect those with pre-existing conditions. It states that \"nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\"\nHere\u2019s the issue: That language says insurers have to provide access for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says nothing about the costs for those patients.\nThe legislation permits insurers to set premiums based on the \"health status\" of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and making a guess as to how they will use medical care in the future.\nThat means the costs would rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor.\n\"Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions,\" Jost said. \"Under the MacArthur amendment, they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable.\"\nThe exact amount might differ regionally, as some states might not allow the higher rates.\nThe legislation would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including the \"essential health benefits.\" The waiver would allow states to set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program to help states reimburse insurers for covering high-risk consumers. \u00a0\nRepublicans argue that the high-risk pools will protect those consumers with pre-existing conditions. \u00a0(Curbelo\u2019s spokeswoman sent us a copy of the Republican talking points that make that argument.) To sweeten the legislation for Republicans on the fence before the vote, the GOP added in more money for those risk pools.\nIn states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status. However, many low-income people aren\u2019t able to stay covered without breaks, and questions remain about the effectiveness of the high-risk pools. Many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans unaffordable.\nOur ruling\nAn ad by the American Action Network says that under the American Health Care Act \"people with pre-existing conditions are protected.\"\nThe only kernel of truth here is that the amendment has language that states insurers can\u2019t limit access to coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. However, the ad omits that the House GOP health plan would weaken protections for these patients.\nThe legislation would allow states to give insurers the power to charge people significantly more if they had a pre-existing condition. While Republicans point to the fact that those patients could get help through high-risk pools, experts question their effectiveness.\nCurrent law does not allow states to charge people with pre-existing conditions significantly more.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n' Share the Facts 2017-05-24 19:49:15 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Under the American Health Care Act \"people with pre-existing conditions are protected.\"    American Action Network group    Tuesday, May 23, 2017 2017-05-23    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03273"}
