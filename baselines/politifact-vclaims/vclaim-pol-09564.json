Ted Cruz says the federal government thinks it has \u2018authority to regulate our toilet seats\u2019", "text": "Toilet seats just got political.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a constitutional lawyer recently elected to Congress, says they\u2019re an intimate example of federal overreach.\n\nHe name-dropped the familiar fixtures in his March 16, 2013, speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC.\n\n\"We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats,\" he said.\n\nDoes the long arm of the law extend into your bathroom?\n\nYes. But some constitutional scholars say that\u2019s too far.\n\nPlumbing the Constitution\n\nCruz, a Republican, is no stranger to the nation\u2019s founding documents. He argued before the U.S. Supreme Court as the solicitor general of Texas and has written more than 80 briefs for the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nHe might like to flush some of its decisions.\n\nHere\u2019s what he told his CPAC audience:\n\n\"There's the 10th Amendment, something our omnipotent federal government seems to have forgotten all about. The 10th Amendment provides that the powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states and to the people.\n\n\"How did we get a $16.5 trillion national debt? We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats and our light bulbs. We need to get back to the Constitution.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve written plenty about light bulbs (which, yes, are regulated) but hadn\u2019t taken up the question of toilet seats.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about toilet seats and the Constitution. The 10th Amendment reserves powers for the states and the people \u2014 except those given to the federal government.\n\nAnd under current interpretations of the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause and 14th Amendment, there\u2019s power to federally regulate toilet seats. (Take that, commode!)\n\nHow? Well, the federal government can regulate consumer products, access to public facilities for people with disabilities and workplace health and safety.\n\nThus:\n\n\u2022 The Mine Safety & Health Administration says, \"sanitary toilets shall have an attached toilet seat with a hinged lid and a toilet paper holder together with an adequate supply of toilet tissue.\"\n\n\u2022 The Occupational Safety & Health Administration says construction sites with 20 employees or more shall provide \"1 toilet seat and 1 urinal per 40 workers.\"\n\n\u2022 The U.S. Access Board requires most restrooms to have at least one \"accessible\" toilet in buildings covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, which means, in part, a toilet seat at a height of 17 inches to 19 inches. Springs to return seats to a lifted position aren\u2019t allowed.\n\nThose MSHA and OSHA rules? Cruz\u2019s office says the federal government \"has no business regulating such minutia.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt could be \u2014 and has been \u2014 worse.\n\nTake the Great Horseshoe Seat Scandal of the 1970s.\n\nThe brand-new Occupational Safety & Health Administration \u2014 which draws constitutional authority mainly from the Commerce Clause \u2014 had decided to implement a variety of voluntary industry standards as law.\n\nAnd it turned out that plumbers had for decades agreed that public toilets should have open-front, elongated seats rather than the closed rings of home bathroom seats.\n\n(Why? Oh, it\u2019s a matter of speculation that\u2019s made us the laughing-stock of Europe, where experts make jokes that the chief of one American lab was too polite to repeat. But it might have something to do with, um, hygiene.)\n\nSo businesses suddenly faced a federal mandate on seat shape. The \"resultant outcries about picayune government regulations,\" as one newspaper columnist put it, helped land hundreds of OSHA regulations on a to-delete list.\n\nThe shape of your public toilet seat was no longer federally regulated by the \u201880s.\n\nPlumbing fixtures now generally don\u2019t face federal regulation. Instead, manufacturers follow voluntary industry standards, which often get the force of law from state and local governments.\n\nBut they could.\n\nCommodes and the Commerce Clause\n\nMeanwhile, the regulations that yet exist \u2014 about workplace seat availability and public restroom seat height \u2014 strike Cruz as \"regulating down to the minutia\" on issues best left to states and local governments, said his press secretary, Catherine Frazier.\n\nHe\u2019s right that the federal government \"thinks\" it has that authority, according to constitutional scholars we consulted.\n\nCruz\u2019s former constitutional law professor at Harvard, Laurence Tribe, offered some examples where toilet seats are \"obviously subject to federal regulation\" under settled law:\n\n\u2022 The commercial sale of toilet seats, like other commodities, in transactions involving an interstate market are subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause.\n\n\u2022 The provision of adequate toilet facilities to workers in businesses affecting interstate commerce is subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring that toilet facilities, like others, are made available without regard to race or disability is subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause and equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe question of whether the Constitution should be interpreted to grant such power to the federal government exposes a deep rift among experts.\n\nRandy Barnett, who represented opponents of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, argues for a narrower Commerce Clause, as do libertarian scholars such as Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute.\n\nA few decisions since the 1990s have gone their way, including the recent ruling that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate wasn\u2019t justified by the Commerce Clause. The framers \"gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,\" justices ruled. (The mandate was upheld under the government\u2019s taxing power, instead.)\n\nBut settled law still says toilet seats are fair game.\n\n\"Basically, Cruz is taking an example that sounds silly \u2014 toilet seats! \u2014 but if you look at the legal basis for the regulatory authority, it's pretty well-established and not all that silly,\" said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \"This is just political posturing, and Cruz, as a Harvard law grad, presumably knows it.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nCruz, railing against modern interpretations of the Commerce Clause and the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, said, \"We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats.\" While federal attention to toilet seats has dropped since its brief foray into seat shape in the \u201870s, and now mainly addresses toilet access for workers and height for wheelchair users, Cruz is firmly right that the courts, Congress, and executive agencies claim federal power to regulate them. His toilet trivia is True.\n\nEditor's note: We updated this item on March 26, 2013, to clarify that the U.S. Access Board requires most restrooms in ADA-covered buildings to have at least one accessible toilet.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09564"}
