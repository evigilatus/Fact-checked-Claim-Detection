The story, currently circulating on email, Facebook, and blogs, says that Romney helped a colleague of his at Bain Capital locate his missing teenage daughter.\n\n\"In July 1996, the 14-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, a partner at Bain Capital, had disappeared,\" the story reads. \"She had attended a rave party in New York City and gotten high on ecstasy. Three days later, her distraught father had no idea where she was. Romney took immediate action. He closed down the entire firm and asked all 30 partners and employees to fly to New York to help find Gay\u2019s daughter. Romney set up a command center at the LaGuardia Marriott and hired a private detective firm to assist with the search. He established a toll-free number for tips, coordinating the effort with the NYPD, and went through his Rolodex and called everyone Bain did business with in New York and asked them to help find his friend\u2019s missing daughter. Romney\u2019s accountants at Price Waterhouse Cooper put up posters on street poles, while cashiers at a pharmacy owned by Bain put fliers in the bag of every shopper. Romney and the other Bain employees scoured every part of New York and talked with everyone they could \u2013 prostitutes, drug addicts \u2013 anyone.\n\n\"That day, their hunt made the evening news, which featured photos of the girl and the Bain employees searching for her. As a result, a teenage boy phoned in, asked if there was a reward, and then hung up abruptly. The NYPD traced the call to a home in New Jersey, where they found the girl in the basement, shivering and experiencing withdrawal symptoms from a massive ecstasy dose. Doctors later said the girl might not have survived another day. Romney\u2019s former partner credits Mitt Romney with saving his daughter\u2019s life, saying, \u2018It was the most amazing thing, and I\u2019ll never forget this to the day I die.\u2019\n\n\"So, here\u2019s my epiphany: Mitt Romney simply can\u2019t help himself. He sees a problem, and his mind immediately sets to work solving it, sometimes consciously, and sometimes not-so-consciously. He doesn\u2019t do it for self-aggrandizement or for personal gain. He does it because that\u2019s just how he\u2019s wired.\"\n\nWe can\u2019t speak to what this episode says about Romney\u2019s deeper character, but we can verify the facts of the episode. In fact, we did so when this story came up during the 2008 presidential election season.\n\nBack then, the story was circulating because of television ad created by Romney\u2019s campaign. It featured Gay crediting Romney with helping reunite him with his daughter.\n\nAs we reported then, based on contemporary news reports, the girl sneaked away on July 6, 1996, to go to a rave party in New York City, where she took the drug Ecstasy. She had told her parents she was playing tennis.\n\nWhen she didn't return, Boston-based Bain Capital, where Romney was founder and CEO, essentially shut down to help search for Gay's 14-year-old daughter Melissa.\n\nBain Capital's 50 employees went to New York, where they convinced more than 200 other people to help search the streets for two days. They printed and passed out fliers. Romney clearly had a leading role in the company's operations, but news reports from the time also said other Bain partners helped coordinate the search effort.\n\nAccording to news reports, the teen was found in suburban New Jersey. A teen-aged boy, who took her in after her partying, called authorities late on July 11.\n\nLt. David Peterson of the Montville Township Police told PolitiFact four years ago that police reports do not mention Romney personally. But Peterson, as well as reports at the time, agreed that the Bain Capital search generated important attention to the case of the missing girl.\n\n\"The thing was it was a 911 caller that saw her on Channel 7 and called in,\" said Peterson, who recalled waiting for the girl to be picked up from Montville police station.\n\nGay says Romney helped \"save\" his daughter, though previous reports have differed on the condition she was in. The line in the retelling now circulating -- that doctors told Gay she might not have lived another day -- comes from a Boston Globe report in 2002.\n\nNewsday, for its part, reported in July 1996 that \"Melissa's parents said she was physically unharmed though she appeared 'very fragile.' The family's doctor had examined the girl and pronounced her in fairly good condition. ...\"\n\n\"She was not harmed,\" Robert Gay said at news conference after she was found, according to the New York Daily News. \"She was in tears. We just gave her hugs and brought her back home.\"\n\nBy all accounts, the effort by Bain employees was central to the effort to locate the girl, and Romney reportedly played a significant role in that effort. We give the account now circulating a rating of True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
