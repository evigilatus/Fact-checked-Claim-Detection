Ted Yoho misleads on claim about Medicaid", "text": "U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, is a frequent critic of the Affordable Care Act but opposed his party\u2019s health care plan.\nThe ACA passed under President Barack Obama included the expansion of Medicaid, a program that provides health coverage for about 74 million poor Americans. (Yoho\u2019s state of Florida rejected the expansion.)\nYoho, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, says the law has driven people to Medicaid, a program he described as a worldwide failure.\n\"With the Affordable Care Act, what\u2019s happened is, all these people have been running to Medicaid, and it\u2019s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care,\" he said in a March 14 interview on PBS, about a week and a half before the Republicans canceled a vote on their health care plan.\nYoho\u00a0spokesman Brian Kaveney walked back the congressman\u2019s statement somewhat when we asked for evidence that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world.\n\"Hindsight being 20/20, the congressman didn\u2019t mean to use the word \u2018worst,\u2019 \" Kaveney said.\u00a0\"The congressman was pointing out that since the implementation of ACA, health care trends have not improved.\"\nKaveney added: \"To say that Medicaid expansion under ACA has resulted in better health outcomes would be a very debatable point.\"\nExperts we interviewed about Medicaid outcomes said they were unaware of any research comparing Medicaid outcomes with the rest of the industrialized world.\nLeighton Ku, an expert on health policy at George Washington University, said that Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, but research about outcomes comes with caveats.\n\"There is no question -- and there is a lot of research -- that Medicaid improves poor people's access to health care, in terms of seeing a doctor, getting medications, etc.,\" he told PolitiFact. \"The problem with comparing health outcomes is that Medicaid recipients start out sicker, both because they are poor, but also because people who are sick really need to get Medicaid to get access to care, while healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care.\"\nStudies about Medicaid\nYoho was referring to two articles in 2017 by Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a policy director for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign.\nCass argued\u00a0that Medicaid studies show that the program doesn\u2019t improve public health. But there aren't studies comparing its health outcomes to other industrialized countries.\n\"Whether people on Medicaid have better or worse outcomes than people in other countries doesn\u2019t tell you anything about the effectiveness of Medicaid,\" Cass told PolitiFact. \"The question is whether there are public programs that have as little effect on outcomes relative to the baseline of no-insurance in that country.\"\nLet\u2019s look at the studies that Cass cited, some of which we have reviewed before.\nOregon study: Cass wrote that a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon showed \"recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRick Scott\n\n\nstated on July 2, 2012 in comments on CNBC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Medicaid expansion is \"going to cost Florida $1.9 billion a year.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n By Aaron Sharockman \u2022 July 2, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Oregon Health Insurance Experiment compared about 6,000 patients who got a slot in a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn\u2019t. Over two years, the study found that while patients in the program initially reported feeling better, there was no real change in health indicators such as diabetes control, cholesterol or blood pressure. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health.\nHarvard study: Harvard researchers compared the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine and New York with other states that made no change in the 2000s.\n\"Only one of the three achieved a statistically significant reduction in mortality,\" Cass wrote.\nOne of the study\u2019s authors, Ben Sommers, said when examining each state individually only the largest state -- New York -- was significant on its own.\u00a0\nSommers has since done additional research and found that deaths from causes most treatable with timely medical care \u2014 such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes \u2014 did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well. (Sommers did part-time work for the Obama\u00a0administration.)\nStudy on life expectancy and income: Cass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study was not about Medicaid, but found differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals is not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care.\n\"Our study shows that behavioral conditions such as smoking and obesity are very important in mortality,\" study author Raj Chetty told PolitiFact. \"The study does not imply that Medicaid is not important, let alone that it has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world.\"\nCass cited one positive health impact from Medicaid: He wrote that it \"may have significant positive effects on pregnant women and young children.\"\nResearchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation looked at the big picture for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\nKaiser reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the law. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health.\nMore research was needed, however, to know the effects on health outcomes.\nHarold Pollack, a University of Chicago professor of social services administration, said that Medicaid, much like private insurance, is a weaker tool in improving health outcomes than \u00a0experts would like to see. But Medicaid critics sometimes omit context about the program for the poor.\n\"Many studies that compare Medicaid recipients to others find negative associations between Medicaid and health for the simple reason that Medicaid serves individuals facing the greatest social and health risks,\" he said. \"These cannot be interpreted as identifying a harmful causal role of Medicaid.\"\nOur ruling\nYoho said \"It\u2019s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care.\"\nYoho\u2019s spokesman said that he didn\u2019t mean to use the word \"worst.\" His evidence focused on studies about Medicaid outcomes within the United States with no comparison to other countries.\nYoho intended to argue that Medicaid under the ACA hasn\u2019t improved health outcomes. Kaiser examined multiple studies and found Medicaid expansion improves access to care and self-reported health, but additional research is needed to determine effects on health outcomes.\nAs far as Yoho\u2019s original statement, we rate it False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    5 7  Politifact Rating: False  \"It\u2019s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care.\"    Ted Yoho North Florida Republican in U.S. House   a PBS interview Tuesday, March 14, 2017 03/14/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03498"}
