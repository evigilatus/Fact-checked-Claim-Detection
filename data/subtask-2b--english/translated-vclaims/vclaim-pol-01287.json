Read one article that appeared on Facebook earlier today, November 6. The article contains what appears to be still part of the television with the photos of Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate of the Governor of Florida, and Ron Desantes, his Republican opponent. The figures \"49.4 per cent\" and \"343.334\" appear in the vicinity of Gelum, \"48.8 per cent\" and \"297.970\" in the vicinity of Disantis. In the upper right corner there's a graph that says, \"Closed call: 99% in.\" This was shown to MSNBC last night, calling the race to Gillum. \"Look at the upper right angle 99% in reference to Florida's vote,\" says the article. Then quotes the story of Huffington's mail without being attributed. \"Oops,\" story stars. \"MSNBC on Monday inadvertently aired what appears to be direct results of the Governor's hot elections in Florida - a day before the actual vote.\" This story was highlighted as part of Facebook &apos; s efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image actually made the air, but the network was quick to say it was wrong. (We saw the picture that was aired on \"Everything With Chris Hayes\" on Nov 5 at about 12:15 the ringmarks that were posted on YouTube. Hez must be told about 28: 30.) On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" Daniel Funk wrote: January 19, 2021 \"Swift explanation here,\" as he said. \"A little sooner than this hour we showed a graph of the Florida race -- it might have caught your eye because our system had inadvertently been doing some test numbers. It is clear that we have not yet obtained any voting totals here the night before the elections. That was a mistake in shooting. Don't worry, I was so confused when I saw her there.\" The results of Florida are not yet available, as stated by Sarah Revell, spokesman for the Florida Foreign Office, and the preliminary informal results of the elections will not be posted on the Florida election observation site until 8 p.m. Eastern time. \"Florida elections aren't fake,\" said Rivel in the e-mail. \"No complaints of electoral fraud have been submitted to our office today. Our voter hotline is open and has helped voters who communicate with questions about where to vote, how to vote, etc.\" Although MSNBC broadcast graphics that look like Gillum won the Governor's race tight, the network quickly said it was a mistake. As Hayes said earlier in the section: \"We simply did not see mid-term elections like this.\" But he added: \"We don't know, let's be clear, how all this energy will translate into election results.\" We value this allegation wrong.
