There is a renewed idea that gives many assurances about Sanders &apos; lack of money and experience, and it is recirculating, after its first appearance during its 2016 presidential presentation. The whole address: \"Bernie Sanders.\" I've never opened a business. I never invented anything. You didn't have a 9-5 job. No draft law has been proposed (25 years in office). He lived outside social welfare before being elected to his post. 74 years old - net worth $300,000. He says he can fix health care and the economy. He wants to be president. Just like his hero Carl Marks, he succeeded in nothing.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The first two allegations - that Sanders never opened a business or invented anything - are true. The historic American People's Assembly, a non-profit association that, according to Pol\u00edtico, made \"low-budget films about people, places and events in Vermont and New England.\" But this wasn't a \"work\" in the strict sense. While voters may certainly like candidates who own business ownership in their autobiography (and possibly patented inventions also), it is not a condition or course taken by most presidents on their way to the White House. There were only seven business leaders, including President Trump, before their election. In the bottom of the mail, he also says he's 74 years old and a net value of $300,000. This meme has not been updated since it was first shared in 2016, when Sanders was actually 74. According to the celebrity Worth network, Sanders &apos; net value is estimated at $2 million in 2017. We will look closely at the other allegations - that Sanders did not have a \"job from 9 to 5,\" that he did not propose any bills that had been enacted, and that he lived far from social welfare before being elected. \"He did not have a job from 9 to 5.\" This allegation can be read literally as meaning that he did not have a job that required him to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. It may also suggest that he has never held a full-time fixed post. According to several reports, Sanders did not receive a fixed salary prior to his election to the post of Mayor of Borlington, in 1981. After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964, however, Sanders did a series of odd jobs before starting his political life. Among his positions were: an assistant in a psychiatric hospital, an independent writer, a pre-school teacher and a carpenter. Many of these jobs were probably part-time, as Sanders ran for office several times before winning, but we couldn't find evidence that none of them were full-time, either. The Sanders campaign did not respond when we asked whether any of these jobs were considered full-time jobs. However, Sanders has held a position for more than 30 years in positions that some may consider more likely to merit full-time appointments. Sanders was the main sponsor of seven of the legislation enacted, according to the records: \u2022 January 16, 2012. 132 (102): For the designation of 4 March 1991, \"First Vermont Centennial Day.\" (HR) 1353 (102): \"Takunian Mountain Protection Act 1991.\" (HJ Reese) :: 129 (104th meeting): Congressional approval of the Public Water Supply Agreement between the State of Vermont and New Hampshire. (HR) \u2219 5245 (109): US Postal Service facility at 1 Marple Street in Fair Haven, Vermont, is designated \"Mathew Lyon Post Office Building.\" Article 893 113: Cost-of-living Adjustment Act 2013 on Veterans Compensation. S. 2782 (113): Bill amending Title 36, United States Act, to improve the Federal Charter for War Veterans in United States Foreign Wars. S. 885 (113): A bill to identify the United States postal service facility located at 35 Park Street in Danville, Vermont, as \"The Post Office Thaddeus Stevens.\" There is no evidence to support the idea that Sanders lived far from welfare before his election. A spokesman for his campaign also told us that the allegation was imaginary. However, Sanders reportedly nominated himself in 1974 for political office while receiving unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are paid to individuals who were previously employed and who are not working because of their fault. It is financed from taxes paid by employers to unemployment funds that are used specifically for this purpose. \"Welfare,\" as traditionally defined in the United States, consists of a number of government programmes designed to help low-income individuals and families buy food, find affordable housing and help pay for medical care. Our ruling indicates that Saunders is not suitable for the presidency because he did not have a \"job 9.5,\" and he did not propose a single bill that passed and lived in social welfare before being elected to a public office. Sanders did not receive a fixed salary before his election, and at some point he ran while collecting unemployment. However, the Mimi ignores other positions he has held over the years as well as his contracts as an elected official. Sanders sponsored many laws that were eventually enacted and there is no evidence to support the claim that he lived sometime outside of social welfare. We're assessing these false allegations. 2019-03-01 20:13:25 UTC Politic Fact 2 1 7 Politic Facting: falish Translating. Bernie Sanders lived away from social welfare before his election, did not hold a \"9-5\" post and did not propose a single bill that was passed.
