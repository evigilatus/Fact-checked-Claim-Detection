Florida has home-grown cases and has started aerial spraying. Meanwhile, a $1.1 billion aid package sits on ice.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan put the blame squarely on the shoulders of Democrats.\nIn an USA Today op-ed, Ryan said his side compromised plenty to move the bill forward.\u00a0The Senate passed a bill that called for $1.1 billion, all in \"new\" money, that is, not pulled from existing funds. The House wanted much less. When the two sides got together to resolve the differences, the House came up to the $1.1 billion mark and paid for it with a mix of new and existing money.\n\"Unfortunately, when this plan went to the Senate for a vote, Democrats derailed it,\" Ryan wrote. \"This was despite months of calling for action, and even voting in favor of that exact funding level just weeks prior. They blocked our plan not once, but twice \u2014 a blatant ploy in an election year. Because of their actions, this funding is in limbo.\"\nRyan has the sequence of events right, but he leaves out one part.\nWhen House and Senate negotiators got together in their conference committee, Republicans added a clause to block any money going to an affiliate of Planned Parenthood in Puerto Rico.\nOn the Senate floor in June, Florida Democrat Bill Nelson argued that this would limit access \"to birth control services needed to help curb the spread of the virus and prevent terrible birth defects.\" He said the House measure was not \"a serious solution.\"\nWithout Democratic support, the bill never made it to a straight up or down vote.\nWe previously fact-checked\u00a0Nelson\u2019s claim that the Planned Parenthood ban would limit access to care.\nHere\u2019s a map of the clinics that would get money under the bill.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this shows a few areas without a clinic, it turns out the Planned Parenthood affiliate doesn\u2019t fill any of those gaps. A public health researcher told us that Planned Parenthood reaches younger and poorer women, but on balance, we rated Nelson\u2019s claim Half True. There would be some reduction in access, but not based on where women live. In theory, they could find care elsewhere in their community.\nSo where does that leave us with Ryan\u2019s claim?\nHe is correct that Senate Democrats agreed to a $1.1 billion plan. But the bill they approved did not have the Planned Parenthood funding ban. To that extent, the bill they rejected was a different bill. Those differences were anti-abortion measures inserted by House Republicans.\nThere were other changes, but the Planned Parenthood element was the one mentioned most often.\nOur ruling \nRyan said Democrats blocked the Zika funding bill after agreeing on the dollar amount. That part is accurate, but the main reason Democrats gave for their action was the Republican addition of language that barred a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico from receiving government funds.\nDemocrats could have chosen to accept that provision and passed the bill. On the other hand, Republicans could have chosen not to add it during the conference committee.\nIt took two to tango. Accordingly, we rate this claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a3846eb7-58d6-406b-8b3e-648407f92f9e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04529"}
