Chick-fil-a (sic) funds National Christian Org.\"\n\"If you eat at Chick-fil-a, this is what your money goes to.\"\nThe post, which is a screenshot of a tweet, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post refers to a bill in Uganda, where homosexuality is already illegal, that would punish gay sex with death. The bill was nullified five years ago on a technicality, but lawmakers have announced plans to revive it.\nIn essence, the post is claiming that Chick-fil-A\u2019s charitable contributions have been used to promote the death penalty for gay people in Uganda. Similar claims about the fried chicken chain and the Uganda bill have been shared thousands of times, so we wanted to check it out.\nHere\u2019s what we found:\n\u2022 The nonprofit the Facebook post is referencing is the National Christian Foundation.\n\u2022 The preacher mentioned in the post did travel to Uganda around the time lawmakers were debating an anti-LGBTQ bill, but there\u2019s no evidence he helped craft it.\n\u2022 The foundation run by Chick-fil-A\u2019s owners has donated to the National Christian Foundation in the past, but it doesn\u2019t currently.\nEvangelist traveled to Uganda with foundation money\nAn American evangelical preacher supported by the National Christian Foundation did travel to Uganda in 2010, the same year the country was debating an anti-LGBTQ bill. But Colorado-based preacher Lou Engle didn\u2019t \"help their lawmakers with the bill,\" as the Facebook post claims.\nLet\u2019s focus first on what Engle did or didn\u2019t do while in Uganda.\nEngle is the co-founder of TheCall Ministries, a defunct evangelical Christian group known for anti-LGBTQ views. It aimed to start \"a John the Baptist type movement to fast and pray in preparation for a 3rd great awakening.\"\nIn 2010, Engle traveled to Kampala, Uganda, to be the guest of honor at a Sunday prayer and rally about \"homosexuality, witchcraft, corruption and the fear of violence leading up to the country\u2019s presidential election next year,\" the New York Times reported.\n\nUganda's President Yoweri Museveni signs a new anti-gay bill that sets harsh penalties for homosexual sex, in Entebbe, Uganda Monday, Feb. 24, 2014. (AP)\nAt the time, Ugandan lawmakers were debating a bill that broadened the criminalization of homosexuality and imposed the death penalty. A different version of the bill, which imposed life sentences instead of the death penalty, was signed into law in 2014, resulting in sanctions from the United States and other countries. A court annulled it later that year due to a legislative technicality.\nEngle was not directly linked to the legislation in Uganda, and he issued a statement ahead of his rally condemning the bill\u2019s harsh penalties for homosexuality. However, during his rally in Kampala, Engle did praise the country\u2019s \"courage\" and \"righteousness\" in pursuing the bill, the Times reported.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\n stated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the National Christian Foundation?\nThe National Christian Foundation is a Georgia-based religious nonprofit and one of the largest charities in the United States. It was founded in 1982 by tax attorney Terry Parker, financial adviser Ron Blue and evangelical Christian author Larry Burkett.\nThe National Christian Foundation gave TheCall $500 in 2009 and $300 in 2010, according to the group\u2019s public tax documents. In 2008, TheCall received a much larger donation from the foundation \u2014\u00a0more than $160,000.\nIt\u2019s unclear to what extent those donations were explicitly for traveling to Uganda, if at all. TheCall announced it was closing sometime in 2018, according to the Wayback Machine.\nA 2012 investigation from the Atlantic found that, in 2008, the National Christian Foundation gave money to Ed Silvoso, a minister who founded a fundamentalist group called Harvest Evangelism, to work with a Ugandan bishop advocating for legislation imposing the death penalty for gay sex.\nThe Chick-fil-A connection\nChick-fil-A did not support Uganda\u2019s anti-gay bill, and connecting the company to it requires several steps.\nMost of the company and its owners\u2019 charitable giving is conducted through two nonprofit foundations: the Chick-fil-A Foundation and the WinShape Foundation. The former was created by the company in 2012 and the latter was founded by the Cathy family 1984.\nPublic tax records show the Chick-fil-A Foundation has not contributed money to the National Christian Foundation. However, the reverse is true \u2014\u00a0the National Christian Foundation gave the Chick-fil-A Foundation hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2014 and 2015.\nThe WinShape Foundation\u2019s tax records paint a different picture.\nWe analyzed the foundation\u2019s returns dating back to 2009, when the National Christian Foundation was donating to Engle\u2019s TheCall. We found that WinShape\u2019s contributions to the National Christian Foundation totaled $240,000 in 2009 and $247,500 in both 2010 and 2011. The National Christian Foundation has also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to WinShape over the past decade.\nRELATED: Instagram post misconstrues food companies\u2019 support for Donald Trump\nWe asked Chick-fil-A and the WinShape Foundation why they passed money back and forth over the years. WinShape didn\u2019t respond, and the company didn\u2019t comment on the tax returns.\n\"The WinShape Foundation is a private family organization. The Chick-fil-A Foundation is the official philanthropic arm of Chick-fil-A, Inc.,\" the spokesperson said. \"Chick-fil-A has not supported legislative campaigns of any kind in Uganda.\"\nThe National Christian Foundation has a track record of donating to anti-LGBTQ groups, such as the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council. The former has supported sterilizing transgender people while the latter has defended the discredited practice of conversion therapy.\nIn 2012, following comments from Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy opposing same-sex marriage, Chick-fil-A said it would \"leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\" But 2017 tax documents from the company and its owners\u2019 foundations show it still donates to organizations with negative views of homosexuality, including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Paul Anderson Youth Home.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post of a tweet claimed that Chick-fil-A has contributed to the National Christian Foundation, which then funded a preacher to travel to Uganda to help lawmakers craft an anti-gay bill.\nNews reports show that the evangelical preacher Lou Engle did travel to Uganda in 2010, around the time that lawmakers were crafting a bill that would have imposed the death penalty for gay sex. However, Engle did not directly contribute to the legislation. While he complimented Ugandans for their stance against homosexuality, he denounced the harsh penalties proposed in the bill.\nFederal tax returns show that the National Christian Foundation contributed to Engle\u2019s evangelical Christian group in 2009, before his trip. Documents also show that the WinShape Foundation, which is run by Chick-fil-A\u2019s owners, donated to the National Christian Foundation in 2009, but the link between the company and Uganda\u2019s anti-gay legislation is weak.\nThe post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
