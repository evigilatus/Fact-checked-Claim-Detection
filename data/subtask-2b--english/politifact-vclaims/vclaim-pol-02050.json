Tina Smith, D-Minn., took to Twitter recently to tout her support for a $15 minimum wage.\nIn the tweet, Smith wrote that \"one of the proudest things I did\" as lieutenant governor serving under Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton was helping to raise Minnesota\u2019s state minimum wage to $9.50 an hour.\n\"Now, I\u2019m proud to back a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024,\" she wrote, referring to a measure introduced by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Patty Murray, D-Wash.\nCurrently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25, though states can set higher levels if they wish \u2014 and a majority do, from a small amount more than the federal level to $11.50 in Washington state.\nIn a threaded tweet, Smith gave some historical perspective on the minimum wage:\n\"The federal minimum wage hasn\u2019t been raised in a nearly a decade. Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago.

That is equivalent to $11.76 in today\u2019s dollars, which is well above today\u2019s minimum wage level and an all-time high when adjusted for inflation. (We used the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation calculator for this purpose.)\nOver the last 50 years, the situation in 1968 \u2014 greater purchasing power for the minimum wage than today \u2014 has been common, though not universal.\nBy contrast, we only found seven years in which today\u2019s minimum wage is able to buy more than a previous minimum wage could. (Those years were 1989, 1995, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.)\nHere\u2019s the full chart, with the inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage shown in red:\n\nAll told, then, the minimum wage has been worth more than it is today for 86 percent of the time over the past 50 years, and less than today\u2019s during 14 percent of that time.\nOur ruling\nSmith said, \"Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago.\"\nSmith\u2019s strict comparison with 50 years ago is accurate, and her comparison even holds for most years out of the past 50, suggesting that the year she picked is not an unreasonable choice.\nWe rate the statement True.\n Share the Facts 2018-05-22 21:25:21 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago.\"    Tina Smith U.S. Senator, D-Minn. https://twitter.com/SenTinaSmith/status/998683080679452673   a tweet Monday, May 21, 2018 2018-05-21    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02050"}
