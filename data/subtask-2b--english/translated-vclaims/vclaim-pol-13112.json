On 5 May, the House of Representatives adopted the Law on Release Now, a measure aimed at forcing the Ministry of the Interior to sell offshore drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Virginia over the coming year. Oil companies bid on leases and then build rigs at the sites. In practice, this measure received unanimous support from Republicans, as well as the votes of 33 Democrats. But the Republic Jim Moran, D-8, opposed the procedure and criticized it in a press release. Moran said that the bill was about a \"fast service\" with the oil industry, not a reduction in energy prices. He said that drilling off the coast of Virginia could interfere with naval training operations. Moreover, Moran said, \"American oil production is at its highest level since 2003.\" We asked whether American oil wells really pump their highest production in eight years. The Department of Energy Information, which is part of the Department of Energy, is the clearing house for American and global data on oil production and consumption. According to environmental impact assessment data, the United States produced 5.5 million barrels of oil per day in 2010, compared with 5.4 million barrels per day in 2009. This is indeed the highest number since 2003, when production was 5.7 million barrels per day. It is interesting to note that over the past decade United States production has been less than 6 million barrels per day. In the 1970s, production ranged from 8.1 million to 9.6 million barrels per day. During most of the 1980s, it was more than 8 million barrels per day. In March, after President Barack Obama had made the same allegation as Moran, the National Officers of Politi Fukte reviewed the statement. Instead of studying the daily average, they reviewed the annual number of barrels produced. These are the annual totals of barrels produced, which date back to 2003. 2003: $2,073,453,000 in 2004: $1,983,302,000 in 2005: $1,890,106,000 in 2006: $1,862,259,000 in 2007: $1,848,450,000 in 2008: $1,817,000 in 2009: $1,956,596,000 in 2010: $2,011,000 in 2010 when Polyte Fact first reviewed this claim, the Agency was expected to see a decline in production of 110,000 barrels per day during 2011, followed by a further decrease of 200,000 barrels per day in 2012. However, updated energy projections in May projected a decrease of only 20,000 barrels per day, followed by an additional decrease of 60,000 barrels per day in 2012. The Agency stated that the reductions would be largely achieved in Alaska, owing to the maturity of the oil fields and the Gulf of Mexico. If you are curious, the United States demand for crude oil amounted to some 18.8 million barrels per day during 2009 and 19.1 million barrels per day during 2010. The daily world demand for oil during 2009 was 84.3 million barrels per day, i.e., the United States accounted for 22 per cent of the world &apos; s oil consumption in that year. As we mentioned earlier, the United States has about 1.5 percent of the world's fixed oil reserves. Let's go over it. Moran said, \"American oil production is at its highest level since 2003.\" He is right that production peaked seven years in 2010. The government expects the drop to be imminent. However, at this stage, there is no strong evidence that the decline has begun. When Polyte Fact National evaluated this issue in March, the environmental impact assessment expected a significant decline in production this year. Since then, it has significantly reduced its expectations of the amount of production that will decline. We also appreciate that Moran appreciates that he is correct.
