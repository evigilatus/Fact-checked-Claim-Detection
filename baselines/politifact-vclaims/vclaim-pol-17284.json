More than 300,000 people have now died from COVID-19 in the United States and in the Northern Hemisphere, Dec. 21 is the shortest day of the year.\u00a0\nBut according to a blog called Daily Buzz Live, the Earth will go completely dark this month for six whole days.\u00a0\n\"NASA put out an alert this last week confirming that the world will experience darkness between December 16 -\u00a0December 22, 2020,\" the blog post said. \"The world will remain dark for these 6 days, completely void of sunlight, due to a solar storm which will cause dust and space debris to block 90% of the sun.\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

There have been no reports of utter darkness. Besides using our sense of sight, we found nothing online to corroborate the idea that the Earth will soon be shrouded in darkness, much less that NASA said so.\u00a0\nWe reached out to NASA but did not immediately receive a reply. However, this claim has been circulating online for nearly a decade. The latest blog post refers to \"NASA Director Charles Bolden,\" but Bolden resigned as the agency\u2019s administrator in 2017.\nA NASA spokesperson recently told Check Your Fact that it \"has not issued any statement with that false claim.\"\u00a0\nThis blog post gets a similar rating: Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17284"}
