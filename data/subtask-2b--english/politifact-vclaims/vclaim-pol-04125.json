But he also offered some economic statistics.\nAt one point, he told the crowd in West Palm Beach, \"Workers in the United States are making less than they were almost 20 years ago, and yet they are working harder.\"\nWhen we looked at the data, we found that it wasn\u2019t quite so simple. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\nU.S. workers are actually making slightly more than they were 20 years ago, not less\nTo understand the first part of Trump\u2019s claim, we looked at statistics for median, weekly, inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 and over going back just over 20 years.\nThe chart, using data compiled from from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, shows that between 1995 and 2015, inflation-adjusted median weekly earnings rose from $314 to $341.\n\nThe extra $27 in median weekly earnings is\u00a0an increase of just under 9 percent over 20 years \u2014 not necessarily a very impressive increase, but an increase nonetheless. It\u2019s also higher today than it was in any year other than 2009 and (barely) 2010.\nSo on this point, Trump is incorrect.\nAmericans are not working longer\nNext, we looked at data for the average number of hours worked annually. There is no data for how \"hard\" people work, so we\u2019re using time worked as the best approximation.\nThis chart for average annual hours worked\u00a0covers 1994 to 2014, and it also undercuts Trump\u2019s statement.\n\nFor this statistic, the average number of hours worked fell from 1,822 in 1995 to 1,765 in 2014, a decline of 3 percent over 20 years. And the only years in which the number of hours worked fell below the 2014\u00a0level came in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession, when jobs and hours were slashed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here too, Trump is incorrect.\nTrump may not have been far off\nAll this said, it\u2019s important not to give in to irrational exuberance about these statistics.\nTrump\u2019s statement would have been more accurate if he had tweaked the timeframe. \u00a0Earnings have been largely stagnant since the turn of the millennium -- a somewhat shorter time period than what he had said..\n\"Pretty much all the gains were in the late 1990s,\" said Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. \"Median earnings are almost flat since 2001, so he would have been close to right if he\u2019d said 15 years.\"\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, added that \"a more reasonable statement would be that real earnings were higher in some past years than in 2015, although that doesn\u2019t sound as damning as the wording used by Mr. Trump.\"\nAlso, Trump would have been closer to accurate if he\u2019d used a different statistic: median household income.\n\nIf Trump had said instead that inflation-adjusted, median household income was lower now than it had been 15 years earlier, he would be correct \u2014 it fell by 2 percent over that span, from $57,790 to $56,516.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that a long-running decline in the percentage of people participating in the labor force may explain the difference in the wage data and the household income data, said Jed Kolko, chief economist with the jobs site Indeed. As more Americans move from being employed to sitting out of the labor market, these non-working Americans bring down income levels for households even as those who continue to work keep wages steady or increasing. (The retirement of Baby Boomers is one reason for the decline in the labor-force participation rate, but labor-force participation is also declining among Americans of prime working age, for unclear reasons.)\nBurtless added one footnote: One reason that real wages have not increased faster than they might have is that cash compensation has been falling as a percentage of total compensation. Cash compensation has fallen from 71.4 percent of workers\u2019 total compensation in March 1995 to 68.6 percent by 2015.\nBecause of this, Burtless said, \"many labor economists would point out that total employee compensation is a better and more comprehensive indicator of workers\u2019 pay than is the hourly wage by itself.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said that \"workers in the United States are making less than they were almost 20 years ago, and yet they are working harder.\"\nAdhering strictly to Trump\u2019s language, he\u2019s incorrect \u2014median, inflation-adjusted wages are higher now than they were for 18 out of the 20 previous years, and hours worked are lower now than in any previous year except for the aftermath of the Great Recession.\nThat said, it doesn\u2019t take too many tweaks to Trump\u2019s language to make the claim accurate, either by changing the statistic in question or changing the time frame.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1c8f3280-3382-4c62-a5e9-823d9636cb44", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04125"}
