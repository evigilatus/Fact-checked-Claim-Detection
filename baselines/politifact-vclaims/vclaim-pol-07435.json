One of those, Sierra Guyton, who was wounded in a playground shooting, later died.\nFlynn said getting firearms off the streets is a focus of his department\u2019s efforts and then offered a statement that you don\u2019t hear often when it comes to crime -- how efforts in Milwaukee compare favorably to New York City.\n\"As of July 6th, the New York City Police Department had confiscated approximately 1,350 firearms from the streets of a city of 9 million,\" the chief said. \"So far this year, the Milwaukee Police Department in a city of 600,000 -- 15 times smaller than New York -- has seized 1,340 firearms from the streets of this city.\"\nAre Milwaukee cops keeping pace with the NYPD when it comes to gun seizures?\nLet\u2019s take a closer look.\nA visit from NYC brass\nWhen Flynn made the claim, New York\u2019s numbers were top-of-mind.\n\"Several NYPD executive level commanders were sent to Milwaukee by Commissioner (William) Bratton to study a variety of topics, including our methods of crime control, community relations, and accountability systems,\" said Lt. Mark Stanmeyer, Milwaukee Police Department spokesman.\nIndeed, the visit coincided with the day of the shooting and Flynn\u2019s next-day news conference.\nWhen the topic of gun seizures was discussed at the get-together, New York officials said they had seized 1,350 firearms as of July 6, 2014, according to Stanmeyer.\nMPD officials saw that figure nearly matched theirs -- 1,347 seizures as of July 24, 2014.\nTo be sure, the MIlwaukee figure included an extra two-plus weeks.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Flynn had a talking point.\nWhen we asked New York Police Department officials about guns seized, they were not able to provide the number for July 6, 2014 that was used by Flynn.\nBut their data tracked with the figure Flynn used \u00a0-- 1,289 firearms had been seized as of June 8, 2014 and 1,881 had been seized as of Aug. 10, 2014, according to department spokeswoman Sophia Mason.\nTo get the comparison on the same time frame, the Milwaukee figure was 1,460 as of Aug. 10, 2014. In 2013, the department seized 1,921 guns.\n\"I don\u2019t believe the point the Chief was making about the population/gun recovery ratio is lost,\" Stanmeyer said in an email. \"Even using the August 10 data, they only have 421 more guns with 7.7 million more people.\"\nHe also noted that the Milwaukee figure does not include 353 firearms turned in during a \u00a0gun buyback program last spring that was led by faith leaders.\nSo what\u2019s the explanation for the similar numbers?\nFirst, in New York the number of guns seized is down compared with last year.\nBratton said in a June 10, 2014 report on Capitalnewyork.com that the number \"in some respects is reflective of the fact that crime is continuing to go down.\" The numbers of murders, rapes and robberies also are lower than a year ago.\n\"We\u2019ve had an increase, a temporary increase, in shootings. ... Crime goes up, it goes down,\" Bratton said in the article. \"It\u2019s always going to go up at some point in time. We\u2019ll always have the ability to push it down.\"\nAnother factor could be at work in New York.\nNew Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to reform the department\u2019s long-standing and controversial stop-and-frisk policy where cops can detain, question and search people suspected of crimes.\nEven before de Blasio took office in January 2014, the number of stop and frisk stops had dropped sharply in the past two years. Law enforcement officials told the New York Post that such stops can be effective in obtaining illegal firearms.\nOur rating\nFlynn said his department\u2019s gun seizures, through a mid-year point, were about to those of \u00a0much-larger New York City.\nNew York\u2019s numbers may be down a bit this year, so other factors may be at work. But Flynn\u2019s claim didn\u2019t get into the reasons why. It was a straightforward numerical claim.\nWe rate it True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07435"}
