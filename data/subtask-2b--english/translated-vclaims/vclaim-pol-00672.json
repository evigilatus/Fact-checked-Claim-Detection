P. Pritzker kept his promise of the election campaign by signing the first increase in the minimum wage in Illinois in law in almost a decade. His plan to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour over the next six years - making Illinois the first state in the Middle West to do so - succeeded without a single Republican vote. Members of the General Democratic Party argued that the movement of Bretzker had broken a promise after the election that he had made to work through the corridor. Last week, the governor was asked to reflect on his first 100 days of office as he appeared on television. Dale Ritter, a Republican from Maton, said that the plan supported by Bretzker would cost Illinois jobs. \"The last time Illinois raised the minimum wage in 2006, the very following year this state lost 50,000 jobs,\" said Ritter. \"The prediction this time is that we will lose 90,000 jobs.\" Did Ritter figure it out? We decided to check. Some 50,000 acquired jobs - the first instalment of the Ritter claim - are addressing the direct impact of legislation signed into law in late 2006, which raised the State minimum wage by $1 in July 2007, followed by a series of smaller increases of $8.25 in 2010. However, data from the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics indicate that Illinois added - instead of losing - a total of some 48,000 jobs in 2007. We contacted the Ritter's office to see what he was referring to. An e-mail speaker replied that his figure of 50,000 was in fact an indication of the increase in unemployment experienced by Illinois during that time, when the number of unemployed Illinoisns had increased by more than 70,000. These statistics come from a different set of BLS data, which do not provide annual averages, and therefore the Ritter speaker referred to the change in unemployment between December 2006 and December 2007. However, there are several problems in this comparison, beginning with the fact that the Ritter referred on television to job losses rather than growing unemployment. However, the most obvious issue is that the State economy has already begun to deteriorate by late 2007. \"We are moving quickly to the Great Recession,\" said Dale Bellman, Professor of Michigan State University, who studies the effects of the minimum wage. If you look at each other in the United States, including a number of those that have not changed the minimum wage, you will find very similar increases in the unemployment rate. It's just a silly comparison.\" On January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s discussion. On 28 January 2021, Stephen Vazari, an economist at the University of Washington, St. Louis, pointed out that, given the actual mid-year date of the increase in the value of the dollar concerned, it would also be logical to compare employment in 2007 to 2008, rather than looking at the difference between 2006 and 2007, as did the Ritter. This, as he said, is likely to show some \"lost jobs due to deflation.\" \"This is a national phenomenon, it is not about the minimum wage in Illinois,\" added Vazari. \"There's nothing here at all.\" Furthermore, the Ritter ignored another case study that deserved consideration: Illinois raised the minimum wage by 35 cents in 2004 and by $1 in 2005. In the years following each of these increases, BLS data show increased employment and reduced unemployment. This points to the proposed link between overall employment levels and the increase in the minimum wage in Illinois in 2006 which is questionable. It was not quite clear from Ritter's remarks what he was talking about when he expected that the next rise in state wages would result in the loss of 90,000 jobs. The speaker told us that this figure was mentioned by the National Confederation of Independent Business, a small business association with a history of opposing state and federal minimum wage increases, when the group testified during a hearing held by the Legislative Committee in Springfield. However, it did not provide any further details, including when or by whom such testimony was given. We contacted the Director of the National Reserve Bank in Illinois, Mark Grant, who sent us an analysis by the organization in 2017 of a bill that would have set the minimum wage in the country on a $15-hour course over four years. The number of jobs is expected to decrease by 93,000 ten years after the entry into force of the draft law from the minimum wage to $8.25. However, this analysis was made of legislation different from that signed by Bretzker, which cannot be considered a neutral source using a simulation model that makes it almost impossible to assess the validity of those results, in the absence of more detailed information. The ruling Ritter told us, \"The last time Illinois raised the minimum wage in 2006, the next year this state lost 50,000 jobs,\" and that \"this time the speculation is that we will lose 90,000 jobs.\" Federal employment data indicate that the Reiter has declined: the number of jobs in 2007 rose to nearly 50,000 higher than in 2006. A speaker said that Ritter was actually referring to unemployment, which increased that year. However, experts noted that the rise was probably due to wider economic forces as the nation moved towards a major recession. Furthermore, Illinois experienced a decline in unemployment following the rise in wages that came into effect in 2004 and 2005. The Ritter's predictions that the upcoming wage increase in Illinois will lead to further job losses are still below the required level. We have followed an analysis of an invoice different from the minimum wage issued by a group that has historically opposed increases in the minimum wage. We appreciate Ritter's claim that he's wrong. It's wrong that the phrase isn't accurate. Click here for more of the six Polic Fact classifications and how we choose the facts to verify them.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00672"}
