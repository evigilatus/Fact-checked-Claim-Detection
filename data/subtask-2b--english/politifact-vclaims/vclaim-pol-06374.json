Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican running for president, made a comment suggesting child molestation wasn\u2019t as terrible as gay relations.\nWe were skeptical,\u00a0in part because we\u2019ve found no factual bases for similar web posts attempting to link Cruz to especially provocative statements. Pants on Fire ratings were bestowed in March and April 2015\u00a0to two outlandish posts about Cruz..\nNow comes this May 2015 Facebook post showing a smiling Cruz next to Josh Duggar, who resigned from the conservative Family Research Council May 21, 2015. Duggar's resignation came\u00a0after reports surfaced that at the age of 14, he had allegedly sexually assaulted four female siblings in his large family, plus an additional female victim. According to U.S. News and World Report, Duggar\u2019s family confirmed the allegations via an apology on their Facebook page, downplaying the multiple incidents as \"very bad mistakes.\"\nFor those of us bereft o' cable TV: Josh Duggar is among the children in the Duggar family\u00a0of Arkansas who are stars of\u00a0the\u00a0TLC show\u00a0\"19 Kids and Counting.\"\nThe Facebook post says that the day after Duggar quit the council, Cruz said: \"While there may have been an age difference, Josh Duggar\u2019s transgressions are far less an affront to God than what gays do to each other.\"\nWe spotted the meme, posted the evening of May 22, 2015, on a Facebook page titled Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off. It had been shared more than 4,600 times in its first four days online:\n\nSOURCE: Facebook post, May 22, 2015\nWe asked Cruz aides about the quotation and didn\u2019t hear back.\nSeparately, our search of the Nexis news database yielded no sign of Cruz commenting on the allegations about Duggar, which surfaced in recent reporting by In Touch magazine, which cited local police reports.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, has been adamantly opposed to the U.S. Supreme Court possibly legalizing same-sex marriage. At an April 2015 event in Wisconsin, he said advocates of traditional marriage should ''fall to our knees and pray'' against such a decision, the New York Times reported. Its April 26, 2015, news story said too, though, that Cruz had earlier indicated at a New York event that he would be comfortable if his young daughter were gay.\nOn May 24, 2015, the debunkists at Snopes.com found nothing to the May 2015 Facebook post supposedly quoting Cruz. Snopes.com added: \"Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off is an entertainment Facebook group that frequently mocks conservative politicians and pundits with fake quotes, and their disclaimer states that their \u2018page is for entertainment purposes\u2019 and \u2018is NOT meant to be taken seriously.\u2019\"\nMaybe this is the right time to point out the same Facebook group on May 25, 2015, posted a made-up quotation attributed to PolitiFact: \"Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off is the most accurate source for news, not only on Facebook, but pretty much everywhere.\" In red ink, the post also says PolitifFact said: \"Trust whatever they say to be the absolute truth.\" Need we bother to debunk that, too?\n\nSOURCE: Facebook post, May 25, 2015\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post depicted Cruz saying: \"While there may have been an age difference, Josh Duggar\u2019s transgressions are far less an affront to God than what gays do to each other.\"\nDidn\u2019t happen and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06374"}
