The supposed Republican candidate for the President &apos; s post has so far refused to release his tax returns, citing the audit of the Tax Administration. Presidential candidates are not required to release tax returns, but information helps the public verify the candidate &apos; s finances, revealing information such as charity grants, investments and the tax rate it pays. The International Tax Service has recently stated that an audit does not prevent a person from releasing his or her tax information. On the democratic side of the race, Mr. Bernie Sanders launched his return in 2014, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched annual returns from 2000. In an interview on 15 May with the President of the National Committee of the Republic, Raines Bribos, Chris Wallace of the Fox News on Sunday indicated that over the past several decades it has become customary for presidential candidates to release their tax returns. Wallace said they're not gonna be released until the IRS review is complete. \"He was asked this week what his effective tax rate is, he said it's none of your business. Look, you know, I was talking about this, but every Republican candidate since Richard Nixon, who was once under scrutiny, He noticed that \"ungood\" that Matt Romney stopped releasing his tax revenues in the 2012 race, and Bribos said, \"I'm not sure if the Americans really care or not whether Donald Trump is releasing his taxes.\" We've looked into the history of tax returns for candidates before. But we didn't dig into the story of former President Richard Nixon's audit, so we thought we should put Wallace's claim on the O-Meter Fact Sheet. Every Republican candidate since the Nixon Tax History project has compiled tax returns for many current and former candidates and presidents, along the way to Franklin Roosevelt's return in 1913. In the last nine presidential elections, every Republican candidate issued his tax returns: Ronald Reagan (1980, 1984), George Bush (1988, 1992), Bob Dol (1996), George W. Bush (2000, 2004), John McCain (2008) and Met Romney (2012). This leaves one candidate since Nixon, Vice President of Nixon, Gerald Ford. Ford assumed the role of President following the resignation of Nixon in 1974 in the midst of the Watergate scandal. Ford ran for re-election as a Republican candidate in 1976, and eventually lost to democracy, Jimmy Carter. Ford never released his full tax returns. He issued summary data on his earnings from 1966 to 1974. The summary data include his total income and total tax, but not a detailed breakdown. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2012, \"Well, I am not a fraud'in returning to Nixon. Nixon did not release his tax returns in 1968 or 1972. The tax authority audited Nixon's accounts in 1973, when questions were raised about a suspicious charity and speculation that Nixon tried to manipulate the tax system, according to a paper prepared for the History Society of the United States Capitol. (This happened at approximately the same time as the Watergate investigation but was a separate matter.) Nixon said one of his most famous lines in this scandal: \"People must know whether their boss is a fraud or not. Well, I'm not a crook.\" In the end, Nixon released a set of financial information to the public in December 1973, including the last four years of tax returns, to try to suppress cash. He asked a congressional committee to examine it as well. However, the Congressional investigation eventually concluded that Nixon owed $476,431 (about $2.3 million today) in unpaid taxes and accrued interest. Excuse me. We asked Joe Thorndik, the director of the Tax History Project, if the IRS had audited any presidents or presidential candidates since Nixon. He did not know - and it would be impossible to know unless the auditor volunteered such information because the tax authority could not confirm or deny anything about a particular tax payer. Thorndick added that he believed that the Tax Service was likely to have audited candidates and presidents in recent years. He said: \"Our lack of knowledge about the audit of the Presidency and candidates is one of the reasons why it is important for public officials to release their tax returns publicly.\" \"Segregation is the only way that voters can make sure that these returns get adequate scrutiny.\" Our governor Wallace said, \"Every Republican candidate since Richard Nixon, who was once under scrutiny, The IRS has audited Nixon's accounts and released his tax returns. But he let them go after he won the reelection. After him, Ford, he issued a tax brief over several years but never returned his full earnings. However, every Republican candidate since then - six candidates for more than nine elections - has disclosed their tax returns. What Wallace says about history is somewhat unclear, although his point of view is correct: the Republicans issued his tax returns at the last nine presidential sessions. We're mostly assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04953"}
