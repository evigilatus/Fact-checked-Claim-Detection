On February 10, a Facebook page called \"Farakhan's Friends\" shared a black and white picture of developments kneeling on the side of a football field along with teammate Al Woodal. The text at the top of the picture says: \"Brodway'Joe Namath a Al Woodall. All the players were kneeling to the national anthem. Now do you understand the ignorance of the current administration and its followers? \"Push this. What's changed?\" The Facebook page title of the article, \"White History 101,\" appears to indicate that the practice became a problem only when Kibernik, a black player, started doing so. This picture has been shared more than 10,000 times and has been highlighted as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The picture is real, but it has nothing to do with the protest and was taken after a long time of playing the national anthem. We have also reviewed a number of stories of the national anthem protests and have not been able to find evidence that it was common for players to kneel before Kaybernik presented this practice in 2016. We looked back at the Tumblr page, a blog created by The New York Times to display photographs from the newspaper's archives. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Nancy Belusi, no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman on January 12, 2021. The sports photographer Barton Silverman took a picture of Namath when the New York Gates team played patriots in New England in November 11, 1973. This is the address: November 11, 1973: \"Joe Namath, in fur, Woodal, who came out of yesterday's game with an infected facility.\" Namath stood on the sidelines while his team was playing shoulder wound, keeping him out of uniform. The Gates team won the game without him. A summary published the following day said that Woodol got out of the game after pressuring a watra in his right-hand elbow early in the second quarter. The live morgue also gave a shot of the back of the picture, which was covered with scraps, stamps and memoirs. Although partially concealed, the original comment says that the picture was taken in the third quarter, long after the national anthem had played. Namath has appeared in many Fox News in recent years and has shown support for the decision of the players to protest, but she has also said that science must also be respected. Our ruling article \"A\" shares a picture of Joe Namath claiming to have been kneeling during the national anthem, and it was something \"all the players\" used to do. The picture is legitimate, but it was taken sometime during the third quarter after Namath's colleague, the Woodall, left the game because of an injury. Nor did we find any evidence that it was a systematic practice for players to kneel during the national anthem. This was not a form of protest and was not during the national anthem.
