They didn\u2019t.", "text": "It was the eve of June 5 \u2014 the night before the Eagles were supposed to visit the White House \u2014 when President Donald Trump announced an abrupt change of plans.\nThe President\u00a0released a statement\u00a0Monday night informing the public that he had\u00a0uninvited the Birds from the traditional post-Super Bowl victory visit. Why? In part because \"only a small number of players decided to come,\" and in part because Trump said that players had been\u00a0kneeling or standing in the locker room during the national anthem, which he said was \"disrespectful.\"\u00a0Many people on the internet made the reasonable assumption that Trump was talking about Eagles players.\nBut here\u2019s the thing:\u00a0none\u00a0of\u00a0the Eagles\u00a0kneeled during the national anthem in 2017. According to a study released by Sports Pundit, the Birds were one of just seven teams in the NFL with\u00a0a perfect non-kneeling record\u00a0for the entire year. And\u00a0they didn\u2019t wait in the locker room either, per ESPN SportsCenter anchor Kevin Negandhi.\u00a0We found no reports that said players stayed in the locker room.\nThe only on-field activism displayed by some Eagles players was the raising of their fists during the national anthem, which was\u00a0kickstarted by safety Malcolm Jenkins.\nThere\u2019s one tiny exception: cornerback\u00a0Ron Brooks kneeled once, but he was cut before the season started.\nThe movement among NFL players to kneel during the national anthem began back in 2016, when\u00a0San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u00a0took a knee during the 2016 preseason\u00a0to protest police brutality and racial inequality.\nAnd other players followed suit.\u00a0A record number of players kneeled\u00a0during Week 3 of the 2017 season,\u00a0after\u00a0President Donald Trump stated that players who did so should be fired.\nLast month, NFL owners\u00a0unanimously approved a new policy\u00a0that would require players to stand if they are on the field during the national anthem, and slap teams with a fine if they disobey. Under the new rule, players would still be able to wait in the locker room during the anthem.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its reporting on Monday night, Fox News circulated images of\u00a0a handful of Eagles kneelingbefore games, implying they did so in protest. Players jumped to defend themselves, saying the photos of them kneeling were actually\u00a0moments of\u00a0prayer, not protest.\nExecutive Producer Chris Wallace\u00a0later apologized\u00a0for the \"misleading\" footage.\nThe Eagles released their own statement \u2014\u00a0basically a subtweet of the President\u00a0that didn\u2019t acknowledge the issues at all.\nPennsylvania politicians have since jumped in on the action. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney called Trump a \"fragile egomaniac\u00a0obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one will attend.\" Yeesh. So that\u2019s what happens when you insult Kenney\u2019s hometown team.\nSenator Bob Casey said he still supports the Birds, and he invited players to\u00a0celebrate at the state Capitol. U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle\u00a0echoed that sentiment, welcoming the team to Harrisburg for Wawa coffee (on him).\nOur Ruling\nTrump said\u00a0he canceled the Eagles\u2019 visit to the White House in part because some players declined to attend, and in part because \"staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling.\"\nBut according to a study from Sports Pundit, there were zero Eagles players who kneeled during the national anthem during the 2017 season. And according to ESPN SportsCenter anchor Kevin Negandhi, they didn\u2019t wait in the locker room either.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01995"}
