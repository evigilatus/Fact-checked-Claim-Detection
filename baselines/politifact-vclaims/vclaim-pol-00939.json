Sherrod Brown says?", "text": "U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown says he will decide by the end of March whether he will run for president in 2020. In the meantime, he\u2019s been on a \"listening tour\" of early primary and caucus states such as Iowa and New Hampshire for more than a month.\nAs the Ohio Democrat travels, one of the targets of his criticism is the Republican-backed tax-cut bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in December 2017.\nBrown, who along with all other Democratic senators voted\u00a0against the bill, said of it:\n\"We need to throw out President Trump\u2019s tax law \u2014\u00a0just completely throw it out and rewrite our tax code to put people first. We know what this last tax law did \u2014\u00a070 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 percent.\"\nHe made virtually the same statistical claim in at least two other interviews.\nIt\u2019s partially right.\nLaw does benefit wealthier taxpayers more\nWhen PolitiFact evaluated the bill just before Trump signed it, we found that every income group would pay less in taxes in 2019, but that the benefits would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers.\nAnd by 2027, every income group below $75,000 would see a tax increase, while only those income ranges above $75,000 would still see a cut.\nThe primary reason for that is some of the individual tax cuts phase out after 2025, because of congressional rules. By allowing some tax cuts to expire, the Republicans needed only 50 votes instead of 60 votes to change tax law. In this case, the tax changes that benefit lower-income people expire, while the measures that largely affect higher incomes do not.\nSo-called reconciliation has been done numerous times in the past, by Democrats and Republicans, when their majorities in the Senate were strong enough only to meet the 50-vote threshold.\nBut 80% figure is only point in time\nBrown actually understated his claim, according to his Senate office. The office, citing a Vox news article, told us the senator should have said that 80 percent, not 70 percent, of the benefits of the tax law went to the wealthiest 1 percent.\nThat article even went a bit further, saying nearly 83 percent of the law\u2019s benefit would go to the top 1 percent.\nBut that figure represents only one point in time for a law that spans 10 years.\nSimilar claim\nWe\u2019ve already rated as Half True a claim that 83 percent of the tax breaks go to the wealthiest 1 percent. That claim, like the Vox article, relied on an analysis that the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, did for three years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn two of the years studied, 1 percenters \u00a0\u2014 in 2018, those with income of more than $733,000 per year \u00a0\u2014 got an estimated 20.5 percent of the tax law\u2019s benefits in 2018 and will get 25.3 percent of the benefits in 2025, according to the \u00a0analysis.\nOnly in 2027 would an estimated 82.8 percent of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent of tax filers.\nAgain, the shift occurs because most of the individual tax cuts end after 2025. That leaves corporate tax cuts, which do more to help upper income earners.\n(Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker and FactCheck.org also rated 83 percent claims and came up with conclusions similar to our Half True.)\nAnother analysis\nJames Hines Jr., a University of Michigan professor of economics, told us that the Tax Policy Center is well respected for such estimates, but he also pointed to estimates done by Congress\u2019 nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\nIn 2019, according to the committee, the top 1 percent get an estimated 23.4 percent of the tax law\u2019s benefits \u2014 similar to the Tax Policy Center\u2019s estimate of the early impact of the tax law.\nBy 2027, the 1 percent would actually get more than 100 percent of the tax law\u2019s benefits, by the committee\u2019s calculation.\nThat\u2019s because the joint committee included in its analysis the impact of the tax law effectively repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate in 2019. The repeal means lower- and middle-income taxpayers lose tax credits they would have received by buying health insurance on the health law\u2019s exchanges, the Tax Policy Center\u2019s Joseph Rosenberg told us.\nA final note:\nAdam Michel, a tax policy and federal budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us that the two sets of estimates appear accurate for what they measure, but that it only makes sense that people with larger incomes would get larger tax cuts in terms of total dollars.\nBut Michel said that many lower-income people get more than a 15 percent cut in their taxes paid, while wealthier people may only get an 8 percent cut in their taxes.\nOur ruling\nBrown says that with the Trump tax law, \"70 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 percent.\"\nOne nonpartisan analysis estimates that in 2027, the top 1 percent will receive 83 percent of the benefits of the law that Trump signed. And another analysis puts that figure even higher for 2027.\nBut both analyses estimate that through 2025, the 1 percent gets about 20 percent to 25 percent of the tax cuts.\nBrown\u2019s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important information.
