That\u2019s why they\u2019re funding her campaign.\"\n\nHe then goes on to tout his experience saying: \"I\u2019m Dan Gelber, as a federal prosecutor I helped put away corporate criminals, corrupt politicians and violent gangs. As attorney general I\u2019ll prosecute corruption and public fraud in a way my opponent never will. While she protects insiders, I\u2019ll take them on and protect what matters most.\"\n\nThe statement that Bondi \"told a group of lobbyists she\u2019ll side with corporate special interests as attorney general\" certainly sounded like quite a discussion, if it indeed took place. So we decided to take a closer look.\n\nWhen we asked Gelber\u2019s campaign to lay out the case, spokesman Christian Ulvert responded with the following arguments.\n\nFirst, the campaign argues that Bondi\u2019s comments at a fundraiser, where she sided with members of the Florida Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Industries of Florida (AIF) on the issue of union-backed card checks, establishes the fact that she a) spoke to lobbyists and b) expressed her support of and \"passed the litmus test\" on an issue important to the corporate community.\n\nSecond, Gelber\u2019s campaign contends that Bondi has aligned herself as being more supportive of business interests by using public appearances before groups like AIF to liken Gelber to former New York governor and attorney general Eliot Spitzer. While Spitzer was forced to resign from his governor\u2019s post following a sex scandal,\u00a0as AG he aggressively went after insurance and financial firms, earning the name \"the sheriff of Wall Street.\"\n\nGelber's argument,\u00a0then, is that\u00a0Bondi told business groups that she endorses a position they\u2019ve taken and took aim at her opponent by saying he would act tough on business interests.\u00a0Let\u2019s weigh those points.\n\nCard check\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2010, Bondi attended a fundraiser held in her honor at the home of Florida Chamber of Commerce President Steve Halverson. The event, which raised $50,000 for her campaign was also co-hosted by Ericka Alba, head of Associated Industries of Florida, a group that lobbies before the state Legislature on business interests.\n\nDuring the event, Bondi clarified her position on the union-backed issue of \"card check,\" which is opposed by big business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Bondi said she opposed card check -- an element of the Employee Free Choice Act, proposed federal legislation that would allow unions to organize in a workplace if 50 percent of employees sign a card in public. Currently, unions can attempt to organize only under federally supervised secret-ballot elections.\n\nStill, it's been more than a year since the Employee Free Choice Act was introduced into Congress on March 10, 2009, by its key co-sponsor, the late Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, and it has yet to come before the Senate for a full vote.\n\nOpponents of the so-called card check, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argue that by making the vote public, unions could strong-arm employees into checking \"yes\" for unionization.\n\n\"If there is any question in your mind, I am adamantly opposed to check card,\" Bondi told the group, as found on this Palm Beach Post video of the event. \"Everyone in this room has known from day one that I am adamantly opposed to check card. So I misspoke and I just want to make any clarification there that I need to.\"\n\nBondi was attempting to clarify her position following a radio interview, given on Aug. 19, 2010, on WDBO-AM 580\u00a0in Central Florida, \u00a0where she seemed to tell host Tico Perez the opposite: \"With the unions, I\u2019m totally against the secret ballot... The votes have to be public. We have to have transparency to make sure everything is on the up and up. We have to protect our businesses in this economy more than ever.\"\n\nAfterward, Halverson chimed in and further vouched for Bondi\u2019s position to those in the room.\n\n\"Obviously, card check is virtually a litmus test,\" Halverson said. \"I can absolutely assure you that what Pam said -- that she\u2019s been opposed to card check from the very beginning. If anybody heard that or heard comments from her desperate opponent to the contrary, rest assured that isn\u2019t the case.\"\n\nGelber has said in the past that he supports the Employee Free Choice Act, such as this March 2009 appearance before the Florida AFL-CIO labor union.\n\nRegardless of how the Employee Free Choice Act plays out on the federal level, it may have little bearing on Florida because it is a \"right to work state\" -- meaning someone hired for a job where the workers\u00a0have unionized cannot be required to\u00a0join a union or pay union dues.\n\nDan Gelber = Eliot Spitzer?\n\nGelber\u2019s campaign also argues that by trying to paint Gelber as a Spitzer-type AG, distancing herself from that model, Bondi is signaling to business lobbying groups like AIF that she would not be as aggressive in pursuing litigation against businesses. \"The obvious and unmistakable context of her argument is that Dan Gelber would take them on and she wouldn\u2019t,\" Ulvert wrote in his e-mail.\n\n\"Unlike Mr. Gelber, I understand the difference between using the attorney general\u2019s office to responsibly protect consumers vs. attacking businesses as an activist AG in the mold of Eliot Spitzer,\" Bondi told the St. Petersburg Times in an Aug. 28, 2010, article.\n\nThe article goes on to note: \"Bondi does call herself \u2018extremely pro-business.\u2019 She said Friday that\u2019s not incompatible with protecting consumers, but voters will decide that.\"\n\nShe used the Gelber and Spitzer comparison at a meet-and-greet event with the Florida Chamber of Commerce on Aug. 19, 2010, at their Tallahassee office.\n\n\"The more I hear about Dan Gelber, the more I learn, the last thing we need is an Eliot Spitzer-type attorney general,\" Bondi said at the Aug. 19, 2010, according to the St. Petersburg Times.\n\nGelber\u2019s campaign also points to a questionnaire filled out by Bondi, Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottcamp and Holly Benson, when the three were competing in the August Republican primary.\n\nAll three were asked by the Republican Club of Northwest St. John\u2019s County: \"Can the AG\u2019s office sue to recover damages against negligent companies whose actions lead to similar disasters as the BP oil spill?\"\n\nWhile Benson and Kottcamp both wrote \u00a0\"Yes\" as their first response, Bondi\u2019s response was more roundabout.\n\n\"Proactive and voluntary action by the business or industry to responsibly correct errors and compensate victims without the state intervening is in the best interest of Florida\u2019s consumers,\" Bondi replied. \"I would encourage the exploration of every possible option.\"\n\nStill she adds: \"However, if legal action becomes necessary because a crime against the state or citizens was committed, or a business did not live up to the corrective actions necessary to appropriately compensate or correct wrongs against our state and citizens, I would aggressively seek to resolve those issues in a court of law.\"\n\nBondi responds\n\nBondi\u2019s campaign\u00a0has already issued a letter to several Florida TV stations airing Gelber\u2019s ad, asking that they stop running the ad and calling it \"misleading\" and \"deceptive.\"\n\n\"He didn't express his opinion about Pam or her policies, but instead, chose to attribute to Pam a specific statement (\u2018I'll side with corporate special interests as Attorney General\u2019) allegedly made to a specific audience (\u2018told a group of lobbyists\u2019) with absolutely no proof,\" said Bondi campaign spokeswoman Kim Kirtley.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSo back to the question. Did Bondi \"tell a group of lobbyists that she\u2019ll side with corporate special interests?\"\n\nShe describes herself as pro-business, and she did tell a group of lobbyists, business owners and fundraisers from AIF and the Florida Chamber of Commerce that she sided with their stance against public unionization votes. But that\u2019s only one issue. In fact, Gelber is also on the record on that issue, with the opposite stance. We don't think that means he'll always side with unions, and we think it's too great a leap to generalize that Bondi will always side with business interests.\u00a0Therefore we rate the claim Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
