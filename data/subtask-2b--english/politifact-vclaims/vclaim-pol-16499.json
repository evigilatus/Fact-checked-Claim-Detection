Hillary Clinton has made as a Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n\nThe RNC has estimated Clinton's proposals would cost some $777.6-billion during her first term. The Republicans did a credible job in tallying up Clinton's plans, but they did make one huge mistake.\n\n\nClinton, at one point in 2007, talked about offering every newborn child born a $5,000 bond as part of an effort to encourage savings for such things as college tuition. The estimated cost would be $80-billion over four years. The RNC included the proposal in its Spend-O-Meter.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
