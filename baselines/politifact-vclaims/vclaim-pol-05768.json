But is she charitable enough to help Washington pay interest on the national debt?\n\nThe #squad at the Republican Party of Florida asked (and answered) the question with a viral image on their Facebook page on Oct. 29, 2015, the same week Swift was in the Sunshine State for concerts in Miami and Tampa.\n\"How many concerts would Taylor Swift have to perform to pay off one day of interest on our national debt? She would have to perform every day for three years,\" the post read.\nWe just couldn\u2019t shake it off. We wondered, would it take three years or more for the biggest pop star in the country to pay off the interest on the national debt, playing a concert every single night? We checked to see if it would be possible, even in our wildest dreams.\nBecause there\u2019s no telling just how much Swift is personally raking in these days (beyond, you know, a lot), there\u2019s going to be a lot of estimating here, possibly a blank space or two. But we do know the national debt is up over the $18 trillion mark these days, so she\u2019s got her work cut out for her.\nJust so we didn\u2019t cause any bad blood, we reached out to the state GOP and asked them how they were figuring Swift\u2019s tour schedule through 2019. They credited the stat to the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. We noted the original version was slightly different:\n\"How long would it take Taylor Swift to pay off our debt? Forbes estimates that T. Swift earned around $80 million in 2015 and performed 55 concerts. She would have to perform every day for three years to pay for one day of interest that accrued on our debt.\"\nThey also point out how hard other big names would have to work, like boxer Floyd Mayweather having to fight for every night for 331 years or Bill Gates having to fork over 229 lifetimes\u2019 worth of personal income to pay the same bill.\nThe foundation told us they figured out Swift\u2019s workload by calculating that she took home 28.6 percent of the gross receipts from her March 2013-June 2014 Red Tour, then stretched it out as if she played for 365 nights straight. That ends up being $526,000 per show, or $192 million for a whole year of Swift concerts (and a whole lot of Instagrams).\nSo how much is the daily interest on our national debt? Heritage used the 2015 estimate for interest from the Office of Management and Budget, which was $229.2 billion for the year. One day of that is $628 million.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossroads GPS\n\n\nstated on July 13, 2012 in an ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Obama has \"added $4 billion in debt every day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 August 1, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak that down and Swift would have to play every night for just more than 3\u00bc years to pay for one measly day of interest on an $18 trillion debt.\nNow, the Heritage Foundation told us they used the Red Tour because it has a full net estimate. But we here at PolitiFact Florida always like to note when everything has changed.\nSwift is a megawatt star these days, and she has been practically printing money since this year\u2019s 1989 World Tour began. The tour topped $185 million between May and mid\u00a0October. That\u2019s about about 60 shows, give or take, with 20-plus to go until Swift can take a breather.\nForbes and Billboard do generally use a third of gross receipts as a rough guideline \u2014 remember, those tours have to pay for all sorts of things besides the artist, like sets and costumes and roadies. The $80 million Forbes estimate for June 2014-June 2015 is hard to parse, because it includes all income, which could range from t-shirts to albums to streaming royalties.\nWe\u2019ll note it\u2019s really not possible to say what she makes from any given show, because every venue is different. The tour stood to make $2.75 million from her Halloween show in Tampa, with a $928,000 bonus if the show sold out. (We can\u2019t confirm whether it did, but reports make it sound like it came close.)\nIn any case, we figure these days it's fair to say Tay Tay is worth closer to a very rough average of $1 million per show, especially when she's playing bigger arenas. That would really help her put a dent in the nation\u2019s outstanding bills.\nWe could also cheat with some creative bookkeeping and use data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which puts 2015 debt interest at a slightly lower $223.3 billion. That works out to $612 million per day.\nDo the simple math\u00a0and our estimate knocks Swift\u2019s theoretical slate of shows down to about 612 nights. That\u2019s a little over 1\u00bd years of concerts. But there\u2019s always the chance she wouldn\u2019t want to fork over all her earnings for the interest payments. She could use a little walking around money, you know? Also, she needs a little time to go home to cats Meredith Grey and Olivia Benson.\nOur ruling\nThe Republican Party of Florida asked, \"How many concerts would Taylor Swift have to perform to pay off one day of interest on our national debt? She would have to perform every day for three years.\"\nThis viral image was inspired by the Heritage Foundation, and while their math is based on old estimates, it stands up to scrutiny. We\u2019ll note that Swift likely makes a lot more money these days, so she could probably pay the bill faster. But the point that it would take an inordinate amount of time to pay just a single day\u2019s interest on the $18 trillion-plus national debt stands.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05768"}
