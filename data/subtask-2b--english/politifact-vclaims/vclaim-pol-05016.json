I won with women by vast, vast majorities. I was way, way up with women far above anybody else in the exit polls of the recent election.\"\nClinton may have gleefully embraced Trump\u2019s \"woman card\" attack line, but we thought it\u2019s still worth checking whether Trump is right that Clinton \"doesn\u2019t do very well with women.\"\nTrump, as it turns out, couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\nThe recent primaries\nLet\u2019s give Trump his due: He has a right to be braggadocious about his own record with women voters in recent GOP primaries.\nTrump unquestionably routed his opponents among female voters during the four recent primaries for which exit polls exist. He won 57 percent of women in the New York primary, 55 percent of women in the Connecticut primary, 50 percent of women in the Maryland primary, and 54 percent of women in the Pennsylvania primary.\nThat said, even among women voting in these GOP primaries, Trump experiences a gender gap: According to these exit polls, women -- by a modest but consistent margin -- supported Trump by smaller margins than men did. In New York, he was six points stronger among men. In Connecticut that gap was five points, in Maryland it was nine points, and in Pennsylvania it was seven points.\nAnd there\u2019s an even more important problem for Trump\u2019s claim: His own success among Republican women doesn\u2019t have anything to say about how well or poorly Clinton is doing with women.\nPolling a Clinton vs. Trump matchup\nWe found seven April polls at realclearpolitics.com that asked respondents about how they would vote if Clinton faced off against Trump in November.

Here\u2019s how women have split their vote in presidential elections going back to 1980, as collected by Rutgers University's Center for the American Woman and Politics:\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nDemocratic candidate\u2019s share of female vote\n\n\nRepublican candidate\u2019s share of female vote\n\n\nIndependent candidate\u2019s share of female vote\n\n\nMajor party faring better among women\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\nObama 55\n\n\nRomney 44\n\n\u00a0\n\nDem +11\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\nObama 56\n\n\nMcCain 43\n\n\u00a0\n\nDem +13\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\n\nKerry 51\n\n\nBush 48\n\n\u00a0\n\nDem +3\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\n\nGore 54\n\n\nBush 43\n\n\nNader 2\n\n\nDem +11\n\n\n\n\n1996\n\n\nClinton 54\n\n\nDole 38\n\n\nPerot 7\n\n\nDem +16\n\n\n\n\n1992\n\n\nClinton 45\n\n\nBush 37\n\n\nPerot 17\n\n\nDem +8\n\n\n\n\n1988\n\n\nDukakis 49\n\n\nBush 50\n\n\u00a0\n\nGOP +1\n\n\n\n\n1984\n\n\nMondale 44\n\n\nReagan 56\n\n\u00a0\n\nGOP +12\n\n\n\n\n1980\n\n\nCarter 45\n\n\nReagan 46\n\n\nAnderson 7\n\n\nGOP +1\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, Clinton\u2019s 19-point average lead over Trump among women -- if it held all the way to November -- would give her the biggest winning margin among women of any presidential candidate since at least 1980.\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that Clinton is not universally beloved by women -- but her ratings are a whole lot better than Trump\u2019s. In April\u2019s GWU/Battleground poll, for instance, Clinton scored a 51 percent favorable rating among women, with 47 percent unfavorable. By contrast, Trump\u2019s rating among women in the same poll was 26 percent favorable, 71 percent unfavorable.\nThe flip side is that Clinton does under-perform among men; the GWU/Battleground poll found that views of Clinton among men are 33 percent favorable, 66 percent unfavorable. Karlyn Bowman, a poll analyst for the American Enterprise Institute, considers this \"a big problem for her.\"\nBut the silver lining, she added, is that \"if past elections are a guide, more women will vote than men \u2013 probably about 53 to 54 percent.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Frankly, (Hillary Clinton) doesn\u2019t do very well with women.\"\nThe evidence he used to support this claim during the CNN interview -- his large margins among women in recent GOP primaries -- is undeniable, but says nothing about how well Clinton does among women. In fact, looking at a cross-section of April polls, Clinton\u2019s average lead over Trump among female voters is bigger than any nominee has registered in an actual presidential election election in at least 36 years.
