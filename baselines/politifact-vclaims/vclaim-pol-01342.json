Heidi Heitkamp, the incumbent Senator in North Dakota, has made her Republican opponent\u2019s voting record on this issue one of her main talking-points.\nIn a Bismarck Tribune op-ed published this week, Heitkamp argued that her opponent, U. S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, \"looks at health care through a strictly political lens.\" Heitkamp attacked Cramer for voting for several bills to repeal and replace Obamacare, and wrote that \"President Donald Trump even referred to one of Cramer\u2019s health care repeal bills as 'mean'\u00a0because the bill gutted protections for North Dakotans with preexisting conditions.\"\nAlthough Trump praised the American Health Care Act (AHCA), when it was passed in the House in May 2017, he later said that the Republican bill was \"mean.\" The bill didn\u2019t make it out of Congress.\nWhat Trump said about Trumpcare\nThe American Health Care Act was passed by House Republicans on May 4, 2017, by a narrow majority of 217 to 213. \u00a0We have analysed the AHCA, and found that it had the potential to allow insurers to set premiums based on the health status of an individual, making costs higher for consumers who are sicker.\nWhen the bill was passed in the House, Trump expressed his support of the Republican plan. \"This is a great plan,\" Trump said in a White House announcement with House Republicans. \"I actually think it will get better. And this is, make no mistake, this is a repeal and replace of Obamacare.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

That was my term, because I want to see -- and I speak from the heart, that\u2019s what I want to see -- I want to see a bill with heart.\"\nShortly afterward, Trump said again that he was pleased with his party\u2019s health care plan: \"Honestly, nobody can be totally happy, even without the votes, forget about votes, this has nothing to do with votes. This has to do with picking a plan that everybody is going to like. I'd like to say love, but like. But we have a very good plan, we have a few people that are, I think you could say modestly, they're not standing on the rooftops and screaming. They want to get some points. I think they'll get some points.\"\nOur ruling\nHeitkamp said that a House bill to repeal Obamacare supported by Kevin Cramer was referred to as \"mean\" by President Donald Trump.\nTrump did say that the American Health Care Act, which was passed in the House on May 2017 and which Cramer voted for, was \"mean.\" It\u2019s worth pointing out that Trump also said the the Republican health plan was a \"great plan.\" Trump didn't specifically say it was mean because of how it handled pre-existing conditions, but that was certainly one of the controversial aspects of the bill.\u00a0The statement is accurate but needs additional information.
