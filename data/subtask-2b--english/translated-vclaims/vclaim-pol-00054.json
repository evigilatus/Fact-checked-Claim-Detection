Let's get this over with when we get back to Washington.\" Let these facts sink into: 1% of taxes are lower than anyone else. 27 million Americans do not have health insurance. Let's get it done when we get back to Washington. https://t.co/T7PZ2SFAHR - Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) 12 October 2019 Ages Right About Uninsured Americans: The latest annual report from the United States Census Bureau found that some 27.5 million Americans lacked health insurance each year 2018. Here, we will take a closer look at her first assertion that \"the 1% pays less taxes than anyone else.\" We found that reality is more complicated than Omar's image. One study says something, Omar said something else a few days ago, and Omar shared an article in The New York Times on \"The Victory of Injustice,\" a new book written by economists at the University of California - Berkeley Emmanuel Sayes and Gabriel Zukman. The book Syez and Zukman presented a similar statistical account, which received considerable media attention. According to the book, in 2018, the richest 400 households in the United States paid a de facto lower tax rate than households in any other income range. Actual tax rates refer to taxes paid as a percentage of earned income. Due to tax exemptions and other factors, effective tax rates are usually lower than the legal tax rates of a certain income level. Some critics have questioned the Saize-Zukman methodology, saying that it overestimates the amount of taxes paid by low-income Americans. This is because their analysis excluded refundable tax exemptions such as the tax exemption for earned income and the tax exemption for children, although both are administered through the tax law. The fact that these tax refunds are not calculated artificially shows the high tax payments to low-income households benefiting from these credits, in accordance with the Centre for Non-Party Tax Policy of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. This is an important context, but there is something else to know in order to verify the facts: Omar's Twitter statement is not the same as that of Saiez-Zukman's book on a large scale. First, their results did not address the largest 1% of households - they dealt with the largest 400 households in the country. This is not a simple shift: the most recent figures in the Tax Service show that 1.4 million families belong to the highest 1%. And this universe is more than 400 times larger than the 400 largest families than 500.3 times. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman (January 11, 2021) II, she said the age tweet of the top 1% is \"less tax\" than anyone else, which can be understood to mean a dollar. However, Saiz-Zukman &apos; s research dealt with actual tax rates, the percentage of income paid in taxes, rather than the total amount paid. How much does 1% actually pay? But through other measures, Omar has a stronger point than that 1% of Americans pay less taxes than the rest of the country. The 2019 Centre for Tax Policy estimates that the highest 1 per cent of all federal taxes paid 27 per cent, compared with 73 per cent of taxes paid by less than 99 per cent. At the same time, the total amount of taxes paid by the largest 1 per cent ($828 billion) exceeded the minimum of 99 per cent ($2.27 trillion). (Note: The Centre &apos; s basic data represent all types of federal taxes, including individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, salary taxes, real estate tax and production taxes, but exclude state and domestic taxes. The congresswoman's statement was accurate -- the richest 1% of Americans pay lower taxes than anyone else, regardless of how the data are divided,\" said Jeremy Sylvain, Omar's spokesman. \"And while the federal tax system is more progressive, when dealing with state and domestic taxes, it paints a more regressive picture of taxes paid by Americans.\" However, it is not surprising that a group of more than 99 times as large is paying collective taxes. Omar &apos; s decision to focus on this point obscures some key contexts: 1% still pays a disproportionate share of federal tax law. How do we know that? This data shows that 1 per cent of the United States tax-paying population earns 16.1 per cent of State income before taxes. But he pays 27% of the tax burden. You can argue that the richest Americans should pay even more than 27% of State taxes; in either case, it is clear that the current tax system requires a small but rich part of Americans to bear a disproportionate share of the tax burden. Our rule (Omar) tweets, \"The 1% pay lower taxes than everyone else.\" Less than 99% of the tax dollar is paid and bears a larger proportion of the tax burden than the highest 1%. However, the focus on these calculations ignores part of the picture differently: the largest 1 per cent still pays a larger share of all federal taxes than it collects in income.
