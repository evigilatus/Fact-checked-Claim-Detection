And just about every American has felt the pinch at the gas pump lately.\n\nSo which had a bigger impact on your wallet? Are you flush from the Bush tax cuts, or did rising energy prices wipe out the fleeting boon?\n\n\nSen. Hillary Clinton thinks rising energy prices wiped out your family's tax savings \u2014 three times over.\nWhether she's right or wrong depends on several factors.\n\n\n\"It depends on how much you drive, and how much you earn,\" said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Institute. (He bikes to work.)\n\n\nLet's start with Clinton's energy number. PolitiFact doesn't know where she got it, since Clinton's camp did not respond to inquiries. But here's what we found.\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2006, \"average annual energy and gasoline costs have increased by over $2,300,\" according to \"The Middle-Class Squeeze,\" a September 2006 congressional committee report prepared for Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Henry Waxman, both California Democrats. The report included the gasoline in your car, oil to heat your home, and fuel for electricity. It also included some tough-to-measure \"pass-through\" costs, such as higher retail prices because of higher shipping costs.\n\n\nGoing by this report, Clinton's energy number seems reasonable.\n\n\nNow, for the tax cuts. In 2001, the White House said, \"Under the President's tax relief plan, the typical American family of four will be able to keep at least $1,600 more of their own money.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's not how it necessarily worked out, said Burman. A median-income family held on to $744 in 2006 as a result of the tax cuts, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis.\n\n\nWell, it happens that $2,300 is three times more than $744.\n\n\nBut PolitiFact finds Clinton's comparison too selective. It appears she's comparing a single year of tax savings (2006) to an escalation in energy prices that took several years.\n\n\nWhat happens if you add up each year's tax savings, and then add up each year's change in energy costs? After all, oil and gas prices actually dropped in late 2001 and into 2002.\n\n\nThe answer is, we don't know. To do that kind of a calculation, over so many years, one would have to account for changing tax laws, inflation, income changes, energy use, driving patterns, what people bought, even the weather.\n\n\nIn short, it's not a number that is tracked by the Energy Information Administration or the Tax Policy Center. Maybe the Clinton campaign did all of that, but if so they're not sharing it with us.\n\n\nWe're left with somewhat accurate numbers from Clinton (judging by one report) that tell only part of the story of energy costs vs. tax savings. At our generous best, we can only give her a Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16438"}
