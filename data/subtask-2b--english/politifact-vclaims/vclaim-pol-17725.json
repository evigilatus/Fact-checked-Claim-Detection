But he didn\u2019t say people should drink bleach.\nHis comments came after William Bryan, the undersecretary for science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, presented a study that found sun exposure and cleaning agents like bleach can kill the virus when it lingers on surfaces.\nTrump remarked on the effectiveness of those methods and wondered if they could help address infections in the human body.\nHere are his full comments:\n\"A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you\u2019re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn\u2019t been checked, but you\u2019re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. (To Bryan) And I think you said you\u2019re going to test that, too. Sounds interesting, right?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that, so that you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we\u2019ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That\u2019s pretty powerful.\"\nLater, Trump clarified his comments after a reporter asked Bryan whether disinfectants could actually be injected into COVID-19 patients.\n\"It wouldn\u2019t be through injections, almost a cleaning and sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn\u2019t work, but it certainly has a big effect if it\u2019s on a stationary object.\"\nTrump did not explicitly recommend ingesting a disinfectant like bleach. Nevertheless, his remarks led some companies and state agencies to issue warnings about ingesting disinfectants. The maker of Lysol said in a statement that \"under no circumstance\" should its products be used in the human body.\nThe Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment about what evidence the former vice president relied on when he claimed the president suggested Americans drink bleach to combat the virus.\nOur ruling\nBiden said Trump said drinking bleach could help fight the coronavirus. Trump did not specifically recommend ingesting disinfectants, but he did express interest in exploring whether disinfectants could be applied to the site of a coronavirus infection inside the body, such as the lungs.
