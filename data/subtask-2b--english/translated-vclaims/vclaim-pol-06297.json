One of the criticisms that Trump made to the White House of Obama during his speech was his dealings with the nation &apos; s nuclear arsenal. \"Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger, by the way, as a country we become weaker,\" said Trump on June 16, 2015. \"Even our nuclear arsenal is not working. It's been shown recently that they have 30-year-old equipment. They don't know if it works. Does this send signals to Russian President Vladimir Putin that they don't know what they're doing? We were wondering what the truth was about his claim, so we took a closer look. We found two special problems with what he said. (The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about this article.) In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to a series of problems within the military command structure charged with handling nuclear materials. In August 2007, a B-52 detonator was carrying 12 cruise missiles that would soon retire. They were all supposed to be equipped with fake warheads, but six rockets were discovered as carrying actual warheads -- something that could have proved catastrophic. Then, in 2013 and 2014, the Air Force gave low inspection scores to ICBM crews at Minut Air Base and Malmstrom Air Base. Also in 2013, two senior officials with key positions in the nuclear chain of command - Deputy Adam Timothy Giardina and Major General Michael Carey - were disciplined. Jaredina was arrested after an investigation into the use of fake gambling chips while Carrie was reassigned after an investigation into \"personal conduct.\" Finally, in 2014, officers at the Malmstrom airbase were involved in a drug investigation, which in turn led to the discovery that 34 officers might have betrayed the competency examinations. These issues were widely regarded as serious and resulted in a number of formal control procedures. But the lapses do not involve the \"equipment\" of malfunctions, as Tramp said. They are problems in command and control -- and although important, they do not suggest that the entire nation's arsenal is \"not working,\" experts say. Kingston Reeve, Director of Disarmament and Threat Reduction Policy of the Arms Control Association, said: \"The nuclear establishment of the Air Force has recently been corrupted by disturbing lapses and weak morale, leading to two major reviews of the nuclear mission of the United States Department of Defense.\" \"But this is far from being said: \"Our nuclear arsenal is not working.\" For example, the youngest B-52 nuclear-armed bombers are approximately 50 years old. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 11 January 2021, while most of this old equipment is fully operational, some components of nuclear weapons, such as warheads, are deteriorating with age. However, this does not mean that a State's stockpile of nuclear weapons \"does not work,\" as the experts have said. To begin with, the Act requires the Pentagon and the Ministry of Energy - which share different responsibilities for nuclear weapons - to certify the safety, security and effectiveness of the arsenal on an annual basis. \"Twice and again, the nuclear weapons laboratories, the Air Force, the Navy and the Minister of Defence have confirmed that the nuclear arsenal is operational,\" said Matthew Boone, a nuclear specialist at Harvard Kennedy School. Riv said that these reviews were accurate enough to reassure policy makers. He said: \"No U.S. military commander will exchange the U.S. nuclear arsenal for the Russian nuclear arsenal.\" In addition, the United States is participating in a multi-year programme to modernize the State &apos; s nuclear arsenal, including the reconstruction of the Mintman III system, which launchs intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Trident II missile systems from submarines, as well as the refurbishment of nuclear warheads and the construction of new and upgraded facilities, such as the Uranium Processing Facility in Oak Ridge, Tin. This modernization effort will cost approximately $35 billion per year over the next decade, or between 5 and 6 per cent of planned expenditure on national defence, according to reports of the Bureau of Budget of Congress issued in December 2013 and January 2015. Cumulatively, the bill can reach $1 trillion over the next 30 years. \"This is the unmatched planned investment of any other nuclear power,\" said Riv. In the end, Bonn said, it is reasonable to have concerns about some issues, \"from repairing the silo of older crews in IBM, to recruiting, retaining and stimulating the right people to operate American nuclear forces, to the enormous cost of replacing the old American nuclear power.\" But he added that Trump is \"fully wrong - and irresponsible, if our opponents believe it - in saying that our nuclear arsenal is not working.\" \"Trump our governor said\" even our nuclear arsenal isn't working. It's been shown recently that they have 30-year-old equipment. They don't know if it works.\" There have been a number of significant gaps in the management of the country &apos; s nuclear stockpile in recent years, but those problems relate to personnel and training. It is not a reference to the fact that the weapons themselves are \"not working\" - which, if true, will be a major problem for the strategic military position of the nation in the world. In fact, the United States spends $35 billion a year to improve its nuclear stockpile, and officials charged with certifying the integrity and reliability of the current arsenal have always given the approval stamp. We appreciate Trump's claim that it was wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06297"}
