WAKE UP!\" \u2014 was written by former Fox News host and political commentator Bill O\u2019Reilly.\nA portion of the essay reads:\n\"The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox. In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn\u2019t kill everyone, but kills \"enough,\" especially the elderly and in-firmed.\"\nRELATED: What we know about the source of the coronavirus pandemic\nThere is no evidence the virus was created in a Chinese lab, or that O\u2019Reilly wrote this.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
