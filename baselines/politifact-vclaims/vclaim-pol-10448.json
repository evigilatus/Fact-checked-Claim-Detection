I don't think Gov. Romney meant any harm. I think he's a good guy. He just has no idea how good he's had it.\"\n\nDid Castro accurately recap Romney\u2019s student advice?\n\nAccording to news accounts, Romney visited Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio (northeast of Columbus) on April 27, 2012. And, as reported at the time by The Washington Post and other news organizations, the candidate told an auditorium full of students and faculty that Obama\u2019s policies had amounted to an attack on success and on those who aspire to be successful.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This kind of divisiveness, this attack on success,\" Romney was reported as saying, \"is very different than what we\u2019ve seen in our country\u2019s history. We\u2019ve always encouraged young people, take \u2014 take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money, if you have to, from your parents. Start a business.\"\n\nWe checked his quoted comments against a video taken of his 35-minute speech by Marc Kovac, an Ohio reporter for Dix Newspapers. It shows his exhortation occurred toward the end of a presentation otherwise lacing Romney's criticism of Obama\u2019s stewardship of the economy with vows to spur the economy and unite the country.\n\nBut was Romney recommending borrowing money from parents to start a business or to pay for an education or both? His wording and delivery didn\u2019t make it clear.\n\nIn fact, the National Journal\u2019s report on the speech said that Romney reported that Romney \"offered a group of college students this advice: If you want to get an education or start a business, borrow money from your parents.\" An aide to Romney clarified later that Romney said he was referring to business loans when he suggested students borrow money from their parents,\" and not, the wording indicates, borrowing to go to college. The National Journal amended its story.\n\nIn any event, Romney followed his remark at Otterbein U. by citing the example of sandwich chain Jimmy John\u2019s, which owner Jimmy John Liautaud launched by borrowing $20,000 from his father (in return for 48 percent of the business) to start the shop, the Post and New York Daily News reported. The Post account says: \"Liautaud\u2019s father had made the loan on the condition that if his son wasn\u2019t able to return the money, with interest, within a year, he would have to join the Army.\"\n\nRomney told the audience that Liautaud\u2019s \"sandwiches are doing pretty well. He\u2019s got shops all over the country and thousands of people who work with him. This is kind of an American experience.\"\n\nAsked about Castro\u2019s claim, Romney campaign spokesman Christopher Walker said by email that cherry-picking one statement from one speech, \"a national policy does not make.\" Romney, Walker said, has laid out his desires to create more jobs and increase take-home pay.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparately, we searched the Nexis database of news coverage and did not unearth other instances of Romney lofting the borrow-from-your-parents' idea.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCastro told his fellow Democrats that Romney urged students at an Ohio university that if they have to, they should borrow money from their parents to start a business.
