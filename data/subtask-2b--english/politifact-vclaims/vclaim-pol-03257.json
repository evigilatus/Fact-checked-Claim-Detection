U.S. embassies and consulates sometimes limit or suspend their visa services for reasons that include natural disasters, civil unrest, war and security concerns, the State Department said.\nIran\u00a0\nThe State Department website said the United States does not have diplomatic relationships with Iran, therefore no U.S. embassy or consulate in that country. Other countries listed as having no diplomatic relationship were Bhutan and North Korea.\u00a0\nLibya\nThe State Department\u2019s website said that on July 26, 2014, the U.S. embassy in Tripoli, Libya, \"went on ordered departure and staff temporarily departed due to the ongoing fighting around our embassy and the serious risks faced by our diplomatic personnel.\"\nThe ambassador to Libya and a core group of personnel work from the U.S. embassy in Tunis, Tunisia.\nSince visa services are unavailable in Libya, the State Department designated the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca,\u00a0Morocco, \"as the processing post\" for visa applications from Libyan immigrants.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyria\nThe U.S. embassy in Damascus, Syria, suspended its operations in February 2012.
