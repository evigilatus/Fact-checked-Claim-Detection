Gwen Moore says her district is fourth poorest in the nation", "text": "Poverty seems to be as much a part of Milwaukee as wind chills in winter.\n\nIn 2009, the city\u2019s poverty rate was fourth-highest among the nation\u2019s big cities, according to census figures released in September 2010.\n\nBut in an interview published Dec. 15, 2010, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a four-term Democrat who represents the city, told a Milwaukee weekly newspaper she represents the fourth-poorest congressional district in the country.\n\nCould that also be true?\n\nMoore made the comment in response to a question from the Shepherd Express about whether there was a rift between congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama:\n\n\"I\u2019m a congressional Democrat and I don\u2019t have any rift with President Obama at all,\" Moore said. \"I think that he is operating in an entirely different arena than I\u2019m dealing in. I represent my constituents in the Fourth Congressional District. I\u2019m looking out admittedly for much more narrow interests. I represent the fourth-poorest district (in the nation).\"\n\nWhile the Fourth Congressional District encompasses Milwaukee, it also covers a middle-class swath of Milwaukee County that includes West Allis and Cudahy.\n\nIs it really the fourth-poorest district in the nation?\n\nMoore spokesman, David Frey, gave us two replies when we asked for evidence to back up Moore\u2019s statement.\n\nInitially, Frey said Moore based her comment on a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article about the census figures released in September. They showed 27 percent of Milwaukee residents lived below the federal poverty level in 2009.\n\nThe headline on that story called Milwaukee the nation\u2019s fourth-poorest city. However, the first two paragraphs of the article, and a chart that appeared with it, made it clear Milwaukee was the fourth-poorest among big cities -- those with populations above 250,000.\n\nFrey later said Moore misspoke in the Shepherd Express interview, and had meant to say she represents America\u2019s fourth-poorest city, not its fourth-poorest congressional district. Frey said Moore has called Milwaukee the nation\u2019s fourth-poorest city a number of times.\n\nThat explanation doesn\u2019t quite stack up, either.\n\nAs noted, the city ranked fourth among large cities, behind Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo. Among all cities covered by the census data -- the comparison Frey said Moore was making -- Milwaukee ranked 46th in poverty.\n\nAs for the 2009 poverty rates among the nation\u2019s 435 congressional districts, Moore\u2019s Milwaukee-based district -- at 25.6 percent -- ranked 18th. The highest rate was 38 percent, in the New York City congressional district that includes the Bronx. That district is represented by Democrat Jose Serrano.\n\nIt\u2019s daunting to describe how devastating poverty is in Milwaukee; this item is not aimed at downplaying the city\u2019s ranking. But exaggerating it doesn\u2019t help, either.\n\nMilwaukee Ald. Michael Murphy recently claimed the income disparity between the city and suburban Mequon is the highest in the country; and former acting mayor Marvin Pratt, claimed that black male unemployment in Milwaukee is above 50 percent. We found both assertions False.\n\nMoore also overstates the case.\n\nHer spokesman said Moore meant to say Milwaukee is the nation\u2019s fourth-poorest city, not that her district is the nation\u2019s fourth-poorest congressional district. But even that ranking is correct only when considering the nation\u2019s largest cities.\n\nWe rate Moore\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13821"}
