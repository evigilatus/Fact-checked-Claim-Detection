Medical experts have cautioned that such measures could lead to more cases.\u00a0\nBy saying the new reports don\u2019t factor in mitigation, Trump made it sound like they didn\u2019t reflect ongoing efforts to limit the spread. But Trump is wrong \u2014 the University of Washington update does take into account mitigation such as social distancing. The Johns Hopkins data was a draft and was not intended as a forecast.\nRELATED: Donald Trump\u2019s 4 biggest falsehoods on ABC News\nUniversity of Washington model includes mitigation\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington released an updated forecast showing about 134,000 deaths by early August. That was nearly double their forecast in late April.\nThe revision reflects the winding down of social distancing measures expected in the majority of states by May 11.\n\"Increases in testing and contact tracing, along with warming seasonal temperatures \u2014 factors that could help slow transmission \u2014 do not offset rising mobility, thereby fueling a significant increase in projected deaths,\" the university said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"model includes mitigation and always has,\" Amelia Apfel, a spokeswoman for the institute, told PolitiFact in an email.\nThe institute\u2019s published frequently asked questions contains more details about how it factors social distancing into the models.\u00a0\nSome experts have criticized the model as the numbers have fluctuated.\u00a0\nJohns Hopkins model was in the works\nThe model from Johns Hopkins University caused a stir after the New York Times reported on an internal federal document showing deaths of 3,000 a day by June, compared with 1,750 now.\nThe draft slide show, published by the Washington Post, included preliminary information from a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor who is contracted with the Federal Emergency Management Administration. Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology, told the Washington Post that his work contained a range of possibilities. A Johns Hopkins spokeswoman told PolitiFact that it is not a forecast.\n\"The information illustrates that there are some scenarios, including the premature relaxation of social distancing, that are likely to cause significant increases in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States,\" the university said.\nWe emailed Lessler directly to ask if his 3,000 figure took into account mitigation and did not get a reply. In Lessler\u2019s interview with NPR, he said the various scenarios took into account how effective current measures are, and that his contract with FEMA prevents him from sharing his final projections with the public.\nThe White House told media outlets that the numbers had not been vetted or presented to the coronavirus task force.\nThe Trump administration has made it clear that even with mitigation the U.S. death toll will grow.\u00a0\n\"Our projections have always been between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives lost, and that's with full mitigation and us learning from each other of how to social distance,\" said Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, on Fox News Sunday.\nOur ruling\nWhen Trump was asked about new models projecting COVID-19 deaths, Trump responded that they \"are talking about without mitigation.\"\nThe Johns Hopkins data was preliminary, and not designed as a forecast. The researcher told NPR that he assumed some degree of mitigation.\u00a0Trump is clearly wrong about the University of Washington\u2019s model, which does take into account mitigation efforts.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18253"}
