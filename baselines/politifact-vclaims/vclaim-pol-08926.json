But one strong supporter of the use of force brought in another factor -- refugees.\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has long argued for greater military engagement in Syria on moral grounds, among other reasons.\n\"It's shameful, while a million children are now refugees, \" McCain said on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation.\nWe didn\u2019t think McCain had the number of refugees wrong. We were simply struck that it was so high.\nIn the past 24 hours, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, announced that the number of refugees had crossed the 2 million mark. For a country with a population of 22.5 million, that means close to 10 percent of its people are in camps or with families outside its borders.\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the U.N.\u2019s High Commissioner for Refugees, called it \"a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history.\"\nThe UNHCR reports that more than half of the registered refugees are children. So McCain\u2019s figure is accurate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anything, it undercounts the scope of the turmoil. Peter Garrett with the British Red Cross said this only tallies people who have registered with the UNHCR.\n\"We know there are people who will not have registered for support, for many reasons. They may be afraid of any form of authority or of registering their status,\" Garrett told CNN.\nThe surrounding countries are strained to deal with the outflow. Lebanon has taken in more refugees than any other country, about 720,000. Jordan is not far behind with over half a million, followed by Turkey.\nIn addition, the UNHCR reports said an estimated 4.25 million Syrians have been displaced inside their country. This would mean the conflict has forced nearly one out of every four persons from their homes.\nWith almost all refugees dependent on international organizations for food, blankets and medical people care, the UNHCR is calling for $2.9 billion in aid to meet their needs. Over 1 million new people left Syria in the first five months of 2013. The UNHCR said if current trends continue, the refugee count will top 3 million by the end of this year.\nOur ruling\nMcCain said the Syrian civil war has turned 1 million children into refugees. More than 2 million people have registered with the UNHCR as refugees and over half of them are children.\nWe rate the claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08926"}
