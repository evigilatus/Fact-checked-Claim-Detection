The determined human excavator\u2019s name is Patsy K., according to Men\u2019s Corner. He is a plumber from Omagh, in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, who was inspired to build his own secret tunnel after watching the 1994 film, \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" In that movie, an inmate played by actor Tim Robbins methodically burrows a tunnel out of the prison to find freedom.\nAccording to Men\u2019s Corner, Patsy K. spent 15 years burrowing under his bed to his local bar 800 meters away. His stunt was discovered after he accidentally hit a sewage pipe, causing it to blow under his neighbor\u2019s house. That\u2019s when Patsy K. received a court summons, the story says.\nUsing a form provided on Men\u2019s Corner\u2019s website under \"Contact Us,\" we sent an email seeking more information about the story. Someone replied under the name \"Tesanj Teslic,\" which are towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hi Ciara, I work for Men\u2019s Corner,\" the person wrote. \"This is an old post, the source we used no longer exists for some reason, so it can turn out that this story is not quite true. But you can check in the Omagh County Court (Northern Ireland) where this allegedly happened.\"\nA spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunal Service Press Team said officials couldn\u2019t search for current or disposed cases without the full name of the defendant, the court that they appeared and the time period when the case would\u2019ve been heard. Other stories give the plumber\u2019s full name as \"Patsy Kerr,\" but it\u2019s unclear what court may have heard his case. The Police Service of Northern Ireland responded to an email inquiry and asked for more details about the alleged plumber\u2019s crime but did not immediately provide more information about this story.\nVariations of the story appear online, including on Tyrone Tribulations, a website that notes \"accuracy cannot be guaranteed.\" Buzzfeed posted its own version in 2014, replete with a gif of Tim Robbins standing with his arms outstretched in the rain. \"This man dug a tunnel to the pub using a spoon,\" the headline said. Alas, the writer had to update the story the next morning.\n\"We messed up,\" the addendum says. \"The story is a hoax, and we fell for it. We\u2019re really sorry.
