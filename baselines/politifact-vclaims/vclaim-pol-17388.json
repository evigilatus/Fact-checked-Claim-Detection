(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nAccording to the story, 114 years passed between the time in 1902 when a man named \"Red Mudger...discovered the biggest catfish ever known to man\" and the day in 2016 when his grandson, Kato \"Mudcat\" Mudger, felt a tug at his fishing line that turned out to be a 170-year-old Mekong giant catfish \u2014 the same one his grandfather had seen in 1902.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE.J.

Eugene Emery Jr. \u2022 May 31, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA couple things stand out about this claim:\nFirst, the article was published April 1, 2016, making it likely April Fools\u2019 Day fodder.\nSecond, a picture accompanying the story has been doctored. It shows the supposed 736-pound catfish lying on the ground. Next to it, a fisherman\u2019s torso and legs can be seen, giving the viewer a sense of scale for the giant catfish.\nBut the original fish photo was published in a Smithsonian article from Sept. 25, 2015, and credited to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Smithsonian photo shows no sign of a human standing next to the fish and the caption under the picture identifies the fish as a flathead catfish, not a giant Mekong catfish, as the Riverbender story suggests.\nFlathead catfish are native to the Mississippi River, but they don\u2019t grow heavier than 123 pounds or longer than 5 feet according to FishBase. Mekong catfish can grow to be 650 pounds, which is closer to 736 pounds, but they have never been seen outside of Southeast Asia\u2019s Mekong River. They are endemic to the area and are also categorized as critically endangered.\u00a0\nAt PolitiFact, we\u2019ve seen before that people get excited about seemingly giant fish, but we have to categorize this story as a tall (and heavy) tale.
