Absolutely not true,\" Latvala told the crowd. \"One tax increase since I\u2019ve been in office. It was a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area only.\"\n\nHackworth has criticized Latvala for voting for tax rate increases when he didn\u2019t as a city commissioner in Dunedin. The county took advantage of rising property values that already were increasing revenue to Pinellas, he said.\n\nWe wondered: Who is right?\n\nLatvala referred to a vote for the 2002-03 budget involving the municipal services taxing unit, which is a property tax paid only by residents who live in unincorporated areas of Pinellas. In August 2002, she was part of 6-1 vote to raise the property tax rate, meeting records show. Discussion at the time focused on increasing revenue to pay for recreation and other services.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatvala misstated the size of the hike. The rate increased a half-mill, not a quarter-mill, from $1.856 per $1,000 of taxable property value to $2.356.\n\nAt the same meeting in which the County Commission raised the unincorporated property tax rate, it also raised a different tax, a 5.1 percent increase of the telecommunications services tax.\n\nAnd a year earlier, meeting records show that Latvala voted with the majority to increase the property tax rate countywide.\n\nIt was a small increase, from $6.75 per $1,000 of property to $6.801, but an increase nonetheless.\n\nShe did vote to raise taxes more than once during her nearly 10 years on the commission.\n\n\"I goofed,\" Latvala said, when confronted with the records.\n\nSo we rate Latvala\u2019s claim as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14360"}
