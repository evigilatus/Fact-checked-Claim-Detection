Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2017\n\nWe decided to look more closely at whether Senate Republicans in fact have the needed votes, and if a hospitalized senator, unable to cast his \"yes\" vote, is preventing its passage.\nDo Senate Republicans have the votes?\nIt doesn\u2019t appear so.\nUnder congressional rules, Republicans had until September 30 to pass the bill with a simple majority. Republican hold 52 seats in the Senate, meaning they could afford to lose two senators, and still pass the legislation, with the vice president casting the tie-breaking vote. No Democrats were expected to support the legislation.\nAs of Sept. 25, however, three Senate Republicans \u2014 Maine Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Arizona Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul \u2014 were firm \"no\" votes. Still\u00a0others expressed skepticism about the overhaul.\nSo at most, even with all senators in attendance, Republicans had 49 votes in the Senate, short of the simple majority it needed for the bill to clear the chamber.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\n stated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the \u2018hospitalized\u2019 senator the sticking point?\nTrump\u2019s repeated claims about a hospitalized senator were an apparent reference to Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.\nFor his part, Cochran tweeted yesterday to clarify that he was ill but not in the hospital.\n\"Thanks for the well-wishes. I'm not hospitalized, but am recuperating at home in Mississippi and look forward to returning to work soon,\" Cochran tweeted.\nThanks for the well-wishes. I'm not hospitalized, but am recuperating at home in Mississippi and look forward to returning to work soon.\u2014 Senator Thad Cochran (@SenThadCochran) September 27, 2017\n\nCochran\u2019s office told the USA Today the senator was recovering from what they referred to as treatment for a \"urological issue.\"\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Cochran\u2019s health concerns would prevent him from returning to cast a vote on the health care reform. But what\u2019s clear is that even with his vote, Senate Republicans are still short of the majority.\n\n\n\n\nOur ruling\nTrump said Senate Republicans would have enough votes to pass health care reform but for a hospitalized senator who\u2019s unable to cast the deciding vote.\nAt most, Senate Republicans have 49 \"yes\" votes \u2014 that\u2019s short of the majority they need to pass the latest health care overhaul. This shortfall would not be overcome even with a \"yes\" vote from Cochran, who is not hospitalized, but rather recuperating at home after receiving medical treatment.\nWe rate this False.\n Share the Facts 2017-09-28 16:22:05 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False   \"We have one senator who\u2019s a \u2018yes\u2019 vote ... but he\u2019s in the hospital.
