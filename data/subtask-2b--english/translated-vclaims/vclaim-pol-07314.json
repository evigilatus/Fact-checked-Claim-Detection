Mr. John McCain, R. Ares, called for the retention of the remaining troops in the country since he visited her capital, Baghdad, in late 2008 - immediately after he lost Obama's presidential election. It continues to argue that Obama made the wrong decision to remove all United States troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. Makin repeated this point on September 10, after Obama announced its strategy to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria - the militant Islamic group that took control of several cities in Iraq and cut off the head of American journalists. On CNN, chatter with former White House press secretary Jay Carney. Carney said that the decision to withdraw was the \"right approach\" and said that the Iraqi Government had played a role in that decision. \"You know, Mr. Carney, you're saying again the facts that are clearly false,\" said McCain. \"The truth is, because Sin Lindsay Graham, R-S.C. and I, (former Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.) were in Baghdad. The Iraqis wanted a force left. The President has never made a statement, during or after that, that he wanted to leave a force left behind.\" It is impossible to know for sure what the Iraqi Government wants, and we have limited information about the talks that took place behind closed doors in the White House. But we can verify what Obama publicly said about leaving troops behind. As far as we know, McKen's right. During the first few years of his presidency, Obama did not make a public statement clearly expressing his desire to retain troops in Iraq after the agreed date of withdrawal. Promises, promises first, some background. The end of the war in Iraq was one of the major promises of Obama &apos; s electoral campaign, thus fulfilling the promise of the elimination of combat forces by the end of 2010 and all other forces by the end of 2011. Obama announced his withdrawal plans one month after taking office. \"Let me say this as much as possible: by 31 August 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end,\" he said on 27 February 2009. He also said that between 35,000 and 50,000 military personnel would be retained there until the end of 2011 to train and advise Iraqi military personnel for counter-terrorism purposes. The deadline for 2011 was set in the 2008 status-of-forces agreement between the George W. Bush administration and then Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Malki (recently withdrawn). What matters in verifying the facts is what happened to the United States forces in Iraq after 1 January 2012. There was a public debate among leaders on this issue throughout 2011. The military commanders in Washington and Baghdad pushed a residual force of between 16,000 and 24,000 to carry out mass terrorist acts and train Iraqi security forces. The White House, as reports show, was not open to a force of this magnitude, although they thought of leaving up to 10,000 troops -- a controversial area that required the approval of the divided Iraqi government to change the 2008 agreement. However, the New York Times detailed how the one-time goal of reducing the strength of 10,000 people had been achieved before negotiations had completely failed. According to The New York Times, \"the new target will be a continuous presence of about 3,500 troops, a rotational force of up to 1,500 and half a dozen F-16s.\" On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the US Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, all of this was behind closed doors and only came out later, so let's look at what Obama publicly said. Although some White House officials spoke to the media anonymously about the possibility of retaining the remaining forces in Iraq, there was no circumstance in which Obama spoke of this as a possibility. If so, he would have collided with his usual talking points. We have read a good number of Obama's letters and observations in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and have repeatedly expressed the total elimination of combat forces and the future withdrawal of all remaining forces. Here's a sample: in a speech delivered by Obama at Cairo University in 2009, Obama said: \"Iraq's sovereignty belongs to him. And that's why I ordered our battle canal to be removed by next August. That is why we will respect our agreement with the democratically elected Iraqi Government to remove combat forces from Iraqi cities by July, and to remove all our forces from Iraq by 2012. In August 2010, he announced that all fighting forces would be withdrawn from his Oval office. He then said, \"In line with our agreement with the Iraqi Government, all United States troops will leave by the end of next year.\" Almost a year later, in August 2011, at the United States Legion Conference, he said: \"After completing our combat mission in Iraq and removing more than 100,000 troops so far, we will remove the rest of our troops by the end of this year, and we will end that war.\" On 21 October 2011, following final negotiations with Maleki, Obama said, \"Last year, we declared the end of our combat mission in Iraq. So far, we've removed more than 100,000 soldiers. So today, I can inform you, as you promised, that the rest of our forces in Iraq will return home by the end of the year. After almost nine years, America's war in Iraq will end.\" However, a spokesman for the National Security Council referred to the platform of President-elect Obama since 2008, which said: \"A force will remain in Iraq and in the region to undertake targeted missions to combat terrorism against Al Qaeda in Iraq and to protect American diplomats and civilians.\" However, this could indicate the transitional forces that will remain between the end of the combat mission in 2010 and the full withdrawal in 2011. As Obama said on June 19, 2014, a press conference, \"We offered a modest residual force to help further train and guide the Iraqi security forces.\" But as far as we can say, if so, he did not talk about it to the public during the negotiations. In fact, Carney, then Obama's press secretary, said something contrary to the press. Throughout the summer of 2011, Karni told journalists that they would consider leaving troops in Iraq if, and only if, the Iraqi Government requested. Otherwise, however, it will proceed with the implementation of the agreed plan and leave by the end of 2011. \"We continue to work within the framework of our status-of-forces agreement with the Iraqi Government, which will lead to the complete withdrawal of American forces by the end of this year,\" Carney said in August 2011, in response to the question whether withdrawal is slowing down or not. \"We have said in the past that we will listen to -- consider any request that the Iraqi Government may have to strengthen our engagement with Iraq militarily, only in terms of what we can do there. But this wasn't close, and we're on the right track to pull out by the end of the year.\" Our referee McCain said Obama never made his statement that he wanted to leave a residual force in Iraq. The President-elect of Obama's platform made a mysterious comment about leaving the remaining troops, and it appears that the White House -- behind closed doors -- was widely considered. However, we did not find any public statements from Obama that he wanted to leave forces in Iraq after the date of withdrawal agreed upon in the months leading up to the end of the war. He reiterated that the troops would be released from Iraq by the end of 2011. And McCain's claim is accurate, but it requires additional information, so it's mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07314"}
