Scott Walker is promising another tuition freeze at UW System schools.\nAnd now in the final weeks of his re-election showdown with Democrat Mary Burke, the first-term Republican is blaming her for past tuition hikes.\n\"With two sons in college, I know how hard it is to pay for school,\" Walker says in a TV ad released Oct. 20, 2014. \"That\u2019s why we froze tuition at UW campuses. I want to freeze it again in my next term. My opponent supported policies that increased tuition by 18 percent.\"\nIn the campaign, Burke has said she\u2019d like to freeze tuition -- but only if more aid can go to the University of Wisconsin System at the same time. She\u2019s emphasized larger income tax deductions for tuition and refinancing student loans.\nBut, looking back, is the governor right about Burke\u2019s support of policies that led to an 18 percent increase?\nLet\u2019s hit the books.\nWalker\u2019s evidence\nThe ad itself lists no footnote as evidence for the 18 percent figure and does not cite any specific policies backed by Burke, who served as head of the state Commerce Department under Gov. Jim Doyle from 2005 to 2007.\nA Walker campaign news release about the ad simply offers the history of UW tuition increases approved in state budgets back to 1967, and Burke\u2019s statement to a reporter in April 2005 that she supports Doyle\u2019s positions \"entirely.\" A campaign spokesperson pointed us to Burke\u2019s general praise of two of Doyle\u2019s budgets in place during her state government career.\n\u00a0None of that makes any direct link between Burke and tuition hikes.\nThat\u2019s not surprising, given that Burke\u2019s job was to grant and track state aid to businesses, not run\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the UW System, which sets tuition rates in conjunction with lawmakers and the governor.\nWe did a search of news stories from the time and found no statements by Burke about raising tuition.\nShe did, in 2007, praise a Doyle budget investment in more financial aid to help families better afford college.\nMore broadly, Burke promoted Doyle\u2019s overall 2007-\u201909 budget as a \"smart, responsible budget for Wisconsin businesses\" that is \"fiscally responsible, identifies our priorities for success, and invests in those priorities\" while including \"more than a dozen separate tax cuts, saving the taxpayers and businesses of Wisconsin $1.7 billion.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuition history\nThere\u2019s no doubt UW tuition rose rapidly in the Doyle era, which ran from 2003 through 2010.\nTuition rates jumped 18 percent his first year, and 15 percent the second. But that was in the 2003-\u201904 and 2004-\u201905 school years -- before Burke arrived.\nAfter that, increases ranged from 0 percent to 9.3 percent, depending on the year and whether it was a four-year or two-year school, UW-Madison or UW-Milwaukee. Increases were capped at about 5 percent for several years.\nWhen Doyle took office, tuition at the system\u2019s flagship UW-Madison campus was $3,854. When he left in 2010 it was $7,933.\nIf you look specifically at Burke\u2019s time in state government, tuition rose 19 percent in those three years, with some variations for different UW campuses.\nUnder Walker, tuition went up 11 percent over his first two years, then was frozen for 2013-\u201914 and 2014-\u201915.\nThe difference -- and it\u2019s a big one -- is that Walker directly controlled those changes while Burke had little or nothing to do with them.\nWe\u2019ve been here before.\nIn March 2014, we rated False a Republican Party of Wisconsin claim it was Burke\u2019s budget in 2007-\u201909 that contained a series of tax hikes. We concluded it is off base to put responsibility for the state budget and its thousands of provisions on an appointed cabinet secretary.\nLikewise, it is wrong to blame a secretary for spending changes in another department.\nOur rating\nWalker said, \"My opponent supported policies that increased tuition by 18 percent.\"\nBurke was in state government when that happened, but Walker offers no evidence that she backed tuition hikes other than Burke lauding her boss as she went to work for Doyle.\nWe rate his claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07078"}
