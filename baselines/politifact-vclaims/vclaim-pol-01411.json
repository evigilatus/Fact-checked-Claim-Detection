Scott Walker attacks his Democratic challenger, state schools superintendent\u00a0Tony Evers, over the state gas tax.\nWearing a Milwaukee Brewers jacket, Walker says in the 15-second spot released Oct. 9, 2018:\n\"Hi, it\u2019s Scott Walker. Good thing you\u2019re filling up, because if Tony Evers wins, he\u2019ll raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon.\"\nWalker has focused on the gas tax for months ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018 election. A week after the gas pump ad came out, he repeated the $1 claim about Evers in a TV ad. And the $1 claim is also made in a previous TV ad by Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin.\n\n\n\n\nAll our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve already been down this road. And what Walker says at the pump goes too far.\nPrevious fact check\nWhen Walkers claimed Evers will \"raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon,\" our rating was Half True. The claim was more accurate on some taxes and less on others.\n\n\n\n\nAll our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhat we found regarding the gas tax:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Aug. 15, 2018, the day after Evers won the primary election, Walker said Evers might be willing to quadruple the state\u2019s 32.9 cents-per-gallon state gas tax because Evers hadn't said how much he would be willing to increase it.\nLater that morning, a reporter asked Evers about Walker\u2019s comment and whether he would raise the gas tax by $1. Evers responded more generally by saying: \"I would support looking at anything, whether it\u2019s removing tax credits, whether it\u2019s slimming down state government, whether it\u2019s gas taxes. Everything is on the table.\"\nBut by the afternoon, Evers said Walker was lying about his views on the gas tax. \"The only thing I ever said about that,\" Evers declared, \"is that every possible revenue source is on the table.\"\nEvers has also said, in speaking about road funding, he \"has no range\" \u00a0in terms of how high of an increase in the gas tax he would consider. And he has said that a $1 increase is \"ridiculous.\"\nSo, saying Evers will raise gas taxes by up to $1 per gallon, when he has only said he would consider raising the tax some amount, goes too far.\nAnd when we asked Walker\u2019s campaign to back Walker\u2019s gas-pump statement, the campaign didn\u2019t cite anything new Evers has said since our earlier fact check.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook.
