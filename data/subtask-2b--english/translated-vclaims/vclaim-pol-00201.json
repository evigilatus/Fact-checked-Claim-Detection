In August, the Washington Post revealed contradictions and inaccuracy in the stories of the military tournament told by Paiden in several letters since 2016. The last campaign took place in August in Hanover, N.H., which focused on health care. At that event, Biden highlighted the needs of veterans, especially those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The Paiden Poletti Fuckett campaign told that they had no objection to the facts of the events reported by the Post, although they said that the article ignored or underestimated what they considered to be a relevant context. Paden told the NPR political newspaper on September 3 that his mixing of details had nothing to do with judging whether or not you were sending troops to war. \"Details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making,\" said Biden NPR. In the Polyte Fact, details are important. These are the facts of the main battlefield events, and how Paden got lost. What Paden said in New Hampshire at Hanover's event, Paden talked about the need to overcome the military spirit. The soldiers needed to know that they could and should seek assistance. \"I have walked in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan 30 times. The medals, silver stars, were hung on soldiers even in the upper Kunar valley, in the middle of a firestorm, and the poor went through. :: Young Navy Commander -- Navy -- in the mountains of the Kunar Valley of Afghanistan. They're behind them, called Pop, a forward operating base, behind these big barriers on the top of a mountain in a small bay in an abandoned country of God. \"One of his comrades was shot. It fell on a valley about 60 feet. A four-star general asked me, can I go to the surveillance room? Everyone's worried. A vice president comes up in the middle of this. But we can lose the Vice President. We can't lose any more of these kids. It's not a joke. \"This guy climbed up friendly.\" He carried this man on his back under fire. And the general wanted me to put the silver star on it. \"I went up there\" He was waiting for the Bible. And I went to prison, and he said, \"Sir, I don't want this damn thing. Don't stick it on me, sir. Please. Sir. Don't do that. He's dead. He died. \"The same way in the middle of Fallujah. These kids are amazing.\" Paden may have described this as \"the truth of God,\" but he wasn't. His story in Hanover is inflamed with aspects of three real events in one hybrid story. Then Vice President Joe Biden puts in the Bronze Star Medal to win the U.S. Military Staff. :: Chad is working during the visit of Biden to Afghanistan &apos; s airborne forward operating base on 11 January 2011. The first actual event: the rejection of the emotional core medal of the story of Biden is the soldier who tells him he doesn't want the medallion. The nearest match is the story of a bronze star attached to the United States Army Staff. Chad Wardak Province, Afghanistan, in 2011. The ceremony was organized at the airborne forward operating base in eastern Afghanistan. The worker did not recover a wounded soldier from Wad. Instead, he tried to save a friend from a burning Humvee, but he arrived too late. \"I never pulled it because it was melting.\" \"Workman told the Post.\" He assured the newspaper that he wasn't looking forward to a ceremony with Paden: \"I tried to get out of going,\" said Workman. \"I didn't want that medallion.\" In the narrative of the episode at National Geographic 2016, Paiden gave this version of what Warrickman said right before the medallion: \"Sir, I don't want to. I don't want to. He's dead. He's dead. I didn't do my job, sir. He's dead.\" The spokesman for the Paiden Andrew Bates campaign said that this was the basic truth of the Paiden story. \"In Afghanistan, he was transferred by a staff sergeant. With the bounty and self-denial of the employer, which is a symbol of the duty and sacrifice of the 9/11 generation of veterans who have provided so much across countless spreads, Bates said. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, Polyte Fuckett's attempt to reach W\u00fcrkman was unsuccessful through military press officials. Paden's campaign said they had no differences with what the worker said to the mail. The second actual event: The Championship in Kunar Province, during her visit to Afghanistan in 2008 with other senators, witnessed a award ceremony in Kunar Province. Then - Sen. Joe Biden, John Kerry, and Chuck Hagel were photographed on a trip to Afghanistan on 20 February 2008. In 2007, during an exchange of fire with the Taliban, a bullet was wounded through the jaw and neck of a soldier with a machine gun on the top of the hill. Under fire, army PFC. Miles Voltz got to his friend, dragged him to safety, stopped the bleeding and saved his life. During Bayden's trip, Major General David Rodr\u00edguez saw him stick the bronze star on Voltz. In 2014, President Barack Obama awarded the Order of Honour, the highest military confession in the country, to the military sergeant. Kyle White. Paden wasn't at the party. In 2007, whites and 13 other members of his band and an Afghan unit were making their way up the hill along a slope when they were ambushed. \"The platoon responded to the shooting,\" said Obama at the White House Award ceremony. Kyle quickly emptied a whole magazine, but as he went to carry again, an enemy bomb exploded and dropped him unconscious. He came to his face banged on the rock.\" Former Army sergeant. Kyle Jerome White gets a medal of honor from President Barack Obama on May 13, 2014. Many other soldiers slipped down the cliff to safety, but Wyatt saw Spock. Ken Schilling was dug behind a little tree, trying to process a broken arm. Obama said: \"Kyle ran through enemy fire alongside Kane and began to apply a stop to the bleeding - protect Kane with his body as the shooting tore that tree apart.\" Wyatt helped another wounded soldier on that hill, and with the shooting in the past, he pulled him into the shelter. That soldier didn't survive, he survived the first soldier. After the ceremony, Wyatt showed the reporters a metal bracelet on his wrist. \"I was given to me by another survivor of the November 9 ambush. Wyatt said he was wearing a matching one. \"This made it more valuable than the medallion of the symbol just placed around my neck. He has the names of six brothers who have fallen. They are my heroes. And then Vice President Joe Biden in a remodeled flag show in Melbourne, Australia, on July 17, 2016. (Paul across AP) The history of Biden mixed events told similar stories in the past, but with variations. For example, during a visit to Australia as Vice-President on July 17, 2016, Bayden referred to a silver star debs on the captain of the Navy at \"An Advanced Operations Base in the Valley.\" Captain Baiden said he was \"a child who jumped off the edge of a mountain where this FOB was with only six people defending him, climbed down about 200 feet, put a child on his back injured, carried him back under fire, but 10 hours later, he died.\" When Paden went to stick the medal on the captain, Paden mentioned, \"Sir, with all due respect, sir, I don't want it.\" This version combines elements of the Voltz story (Baiden was present at his polish), the White story (hero along with a cliff) and the Workman story (will not get the medal). This version also distorts certain elements (a bronze star, not a silver star). Then Vice-President Joe Biden joined the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Missouri, Jason Kender, in a campaign rally in St. Louis, Missouri. Later that year, while American candidate Jason Kender was in the Senate, Paden said another version. He referred to both the cliff tournament and Hamvey's burning, noting that both medal holders had tried to reject the medal, saying that they did not deserve it. \"This is God's truth,\" said Paden at some point in rehearsing his story. The governor, Bayden, said that as Vice President, he put a silver star on a naval captain in Afghanistan. Paden said the soldier took out a comrade with fatal injuries from Wade and later resisted a medal. He pinned a medal on a soldier who felt he wasn't worth a medal, and he was in Afghanistan. From there, there are several false details: the soldier tried to rescue a comrade from the burning Hamvi, not from the valley slope. He was a specialist in the army, not a commander in the Navy. Paden was a senator, not a vice president. The medallion was a bronze star, not a silver star. The emotional element of a soldier who feels his medal is unjustified. But Paiden decorated the story with detail to give the story an undeniable circle of truth, and the facts do not support it. We're assessing this mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00201"}
