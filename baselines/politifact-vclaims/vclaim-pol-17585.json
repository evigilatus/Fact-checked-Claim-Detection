No. Tiffany misses the mark.", "text": "State Sen. Tom Tiffany, a candidate for Wisconsin\u2019s open 7th U.S. Congressional District seat, has a theory about what\u2019s causing dairy farmers to struggle throughout Wisconsin: the growing wolf population.\u00a0\nThe district, which covers northwest Wisconsin, is open after Republican Sean Duffy stepped down in September 2019. The primary is Feb. 18, and the special election will be held May 12.\u00a0\nDuring a Dec. 12, 2019, Republican debate, a panelist asked Tiffany and his primary opponent, Army veteran Jason Church, about economic growth in the state, specifically about what the candidates would do to combat the rising popularity of socialism.\u00a0\nIn response, Tiffany spoke about \"socialistic things\" that happen in the federal government, among them the decision to keep wolves on the endangered species list:\u00a0\n\"We should be able to manage the wolf population here in Wisconsin, by our own state rather than the federal government. What happens as a result of the federal government managing it? Our farmers, their cattle get harmed by it. They're attacked, livestock. Their cattle get harassed, less production. It harms their businesses. And we're wondering why farms are going out of business in Wisconsin?\"\u00a0\nIn other words, wolves play a key role in the struggles of dairy farms across the state.\u00a0\nIn 2019, more than 800 dairy farms in Wisconsin -- many of them small, family-run operations -- closed amid a deep downturn in milk prices and other factors.\u00a0\nIs Tiffany right?\u00a0\nWolves have long been a problem for farmers\u00a0\nTiffany has made similar claims in the past about the impact of wolves on cows. In September 2016, he was one of the co-hosts of a wolf summit in Cumberland and pushed for the delisting of wolves, because of the harm they bring to farmers and cattle.\u00a0\nWhen we asked Tiffany\u2019s campaign team for backup, his staff said the information came from Tiffany\u2019s own upbringing on a dairy farm, and seeing the effect of stress on cows. The stress of predation by wolves can cause cows to lose pregnancies, lower milk production and lead to\u00a0 smaller weight gains, said Mattias Gugel, Tiffany\u2019s communications director.\nThe state\u2019s gray wolves were granted protection in 1974 under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits the killing of any protected animal.\u00a0\nSince then, the population of wolves has grown in Wisconsin, reaching 205 in 1999, and growing to about 978 wolves during the 2018-2019 count, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.\u00a0\nThe wolves have reached a point in recovery that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering removing them from the endangered species list, with a final determination to come in spring 2020, according to the agency\u2019s website. That would allow wolves to be hunted.\u00a0\nOne measure of damage from wolves is a state program that reimburses farmers for losses from verified wolf killings.\nIn 2018, the most recent year available, the state of Wisconsin paid out more than $63,000 for 26 dead calves, 43 missing calves, four dead cows and two treatments of cattle by a veterinarian, according to DNR documents.\u00a0\nThat same year, 691 dairy farms closed, some with as much as $150,000 of projected losses that year for a single farm, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\u00a0\nAll told, the state\u2019s dairy industry includes 1.28 million cows on more than 7,000 farms, and accounts for a $45.6 billion share of the economy, according to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom that perspective, the impact of killed or injured livestock is tiny.\u00a0\nAlso, the area for wolves, mostly in northern and central Wisconsin, as shown on DNR maps, seemingly overlaps little with maps of dairy operations that have closed in the last several years, which has been largely in southern and western portions of the state, according to data from the Journal Sentinel.\u00a0\nThe effects of wolves beyond just predation are hard to tell\nAccording to a study published by the DNR in 2007, it\u2019s hard to tell the actual effect of wolves on cows, because most evaluations focus mainly on predation and killings.\u00a0\nOther effects could include stillbirths from stress and decreased weight gain from increased vigilance, but those results were hypothetical, and unable to be properly proven without a different study, said Adrian Wydeven, one of the researchers who worked on the DNR study and a certified wildlife biologist.\n\"Producers may suspect and have lower rates of pregnancy and lower weights, but unless you can eliminate all other factors, it\u2019s hard to attribute some of these non-lethal impacts on livestock,\" Wydeven said.\u00a0\nHe also pointed out that most studies on wolf and cattle interactions focus on beef livestock, because dairy farms often have more people moving around, and the cows are brought in several times a day for milking. That can discourage wolves in the area.\nAdrian Treves, a professor with the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said dairy cattle are less affected by wolves than by other elements of their environment.\u00a0\n\"The hypothesis of body weight loss in domestic animals exposed to wolves, as Mr. Tiffany is suggesting, has little solid evidence worldwide although it has been mentioned for decades,\" Treves wrote in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"Considering the vastly more costly and concerning losses of farm animals to weather and disease, Wisconsin\u2019s family farmers would benefit from attention to more important issues.\"\u00a0\nOther factors at play\nThere are many other larger factors at play, as the Journal Sentinel and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin found in the Dairyland in Distress series.\nAmong them: The long-running decline in milk consumption, the drop in milk prices paid to farmers, increased global competition and the struggle to maintain leadership in the industry, as well as more recently, the impact of tariffs and trade wars.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, the number of wolves in the state started to skyrocket in the early 2000s. During that time, milk production grew steadily and continues to grow -- which itself is a factor in lower prices.\u00a0\nThat, too, undermines the impact Tiffany places on wolves.\nMark Stephenson, director of the Center for Dairy Profitability at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin that wolves haven\u2019t come up as a factor in his conversations with milk producers.\u00a0\n\"That isn\u2019t to say that there aren\u2019t a few farms on the edge of our wilder areas of the state where this could be an issue, but it certainly isn\u2019t a major issue for the greater dairy industry in the state,\" he wrote. \"It is more likely to impact grazing farms on the edge of large woodland tracks, and we don\u2019t have a significant portion of our dairy industry under those conditions.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\nTiffany claimed federal regulation of the wolf population has led to attacks on livestock, driving down production, leading to dairy farms going out of business.\u00a0\nBut the number of cows killed by wolves is tiny in comparison to the size of the state\u2019s dairy industry, which has been battered by years of low milk prices, declining consumption and a host of global economic factors. What\u2019s more, the rise in the wolf population came amid a period of growing milk production. And it\u2019s that over supply that is helping drive down prices.\u00a0\nOur definition for Pants on Fire is \"the statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\" That fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17585"}
