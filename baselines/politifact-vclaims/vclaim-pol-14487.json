Russ Feingold. And oil company profits have long been a debating point between the parties.\n\nIn his speech, Johnson spoke in defense of oil industry profits and against candidates who criticize the big oil companies. He said the industry\u2019s success fuels further exploration -- and its stock helps fund the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.\n\n\"How many times have you heard a politician attack Big Oil and Big Pharma as if these were some kind of evil enterprises preying on our society?\" Johnson said at the rally. \"Why do they do this? \u00a0Well, I guess it sounds good to some people, and might help them get elected in some districts. But I can guarantee you, it does nothing to help our country.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know about you, but I want businesses to succeed ... I want oil companies to make enough money to continue to explore, drill, refine and deliver gas to virtually every corner of America.\n\n\"Almost everyone's 401(k) or retirement fund owns stock in these companies. \u00a0And I hope everyone realizes that both the state and federal governments make more per gallon in gas taxes than the oil companies make themselves for doing all the work.\"\n\nSo is Johnson on the money regarding the government\u2019s take of gasoline sales?\n\nHis campaign offers evidence from the American Petroleum Institute, the national trade group representing oil and gas companies. An institute report released in August suggests that, per dollar of sales, gas taxes are more than double the net income earned by the largest oil companies.\n\nBut Stephen Comstock, API\u2019s manager of tax policy, steered PolitiFact Wisconsin away from the institute\u2019s own per-gallon breakdown. He said it could be confusing and might not be appropriate for assessing the notion that gas taxes exceed profits.\n\nComstock suggested the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that compiles tax and revenue data about the biggest oil companies.\n\nTheir numbers aren\u2019t a perfect fit for the Johnson claim, in part because they include profits from products other than gasoline. But government and private researchers say they are the best available.\n\nWe found that Johnson\u2019s equation holds up in some years but is off base in others. The reason: Industry profits fluctuate wildly with the price of crude oil. We examined U.S. profits as well as the total net profits including foreign sales.\n\nHere\u2019s the scorecard:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. profits: Gas taxes topped big oil\u2019s domestic profits in six years out of the last 10, ending in 2008.\n\nForeign and domestic profits: Taxes beat profits twice in 10 years. This comparison, though, leaves out foreign gas taxes.\n\n\nIn individual years, the range can be wide. In down years, gas taxes paid by the industry -- and passed along to drivers at the pump -- can exceed even combined US-foreign profits by 100 percent (1999). In boom times, U.S. profits alone can top gas taxes paid by almost 40 percent (2006).\n\nA 2010 study by the Tax Foundation, a conservative research organization, went back even further. It found that excise taxes collected from the industry outstripped combined foreign and domestic profits in 12 of the 28 years reviewed.\n\nSo let\u2019s take stock.\n\nJohnson\u2019s timing was good: When he gave his speech, taxes the year before came in higher than U.S. profits by the big companies. That 2008 comparison is the latest available on the federal website. But he didn\u2019t put a time frame on his statement, stating the equation as a timeless fact. And if you include foreign profits, it\u2019s not on target even for 2008. The reality is it depends on the year, which is an important detail.
