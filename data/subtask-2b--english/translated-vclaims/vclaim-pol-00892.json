To read the others, click here. El Paso, a democracy of Pitto Aurroque, who was declared a presidential candidate on Thursday, has been harassing a presidential bid for weeks. Speculation about his intentions prompted the conservative growth club to issue a television announcement seeking to weaken the enthusiasm of Orrick among the major democratic voters. The announcement argues that Aurourke has moved on because of the \"white male privilege\" and is far from former President Barack Obama, where many made comparisons between Democrats. He also claims that Aurourke's father, a billionaire real estate developer from El Paso, led a major company to buy a seat in Congress. The Growth Club presented a fact sheet detailing the source of each statement in the Declaration. Sources include press articles and other online sources. Aurourke did not respond to the request for comment. Did Sanders buy his seat in Congress? Amy Hoover Sanders was married in early 2000. Her father, William Sanders, is a wealthy real estate developer who grew up in El Paso. A financial review carried out by Forbes in November 2018 found it \"not likely, though, that it is a billionaire.\" It was estimated that Saunders would instead be worth a net amount of nearly $500 million. Sanders contributed directly to the Aurourke campaign for Congress in 2012, and gave him $5,000 in individual contributions to finance his challenge at that time - the United States Republic of Sylvester Reyes, the Democratic Party of El Paso, whose seat he held for almost 16 years. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, during the race, Reyes was targeted by the initial accountability campaign, Super PAC with the stated goal of assisting long-standing candidates from both parties. The group, founded by Leo Linbeck III in Houston, targeted candidates in Texas, Ohio, Illinois and a number of other states during the 2012 elections, spending over $1.8 million across 15 races in Congress. The campaign's funding reports show that the stock exchange put the largest amount in the Oroc-Reyes race: it spent $240,000 on Reyes but did not contribute financially to the Orroc campaign. Sanders did not contribute directly to the initial accountability campaign, but Camper II's partners, a partnership with Sanders, contributed $37,500 to the group. However, other donors contributed significantly more to the Policy Assessment Conference than NEPAD. Lennybeck donated more than $775,000, Joe J. Ricketts donated $500,000, and Texas President Empowerment gave Tim Dunn $350,000. Eric O'Keefe, one of the founders of the Peace Assessment Commission, contributed $100,000. The ruling growth club of our Orrock, a billionaire real estate developer from El Paso, said, \"He set up a major company to buy a seat in Congress for Beto.\" Saunders is not a billionaire. :: Contributed to the Peace Assessment Commission, which had long been targeted at office holders in Congress, including the Aurourke opponent. However, his contribution did not come close to other contributions to the Panel. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. :: Editor &apos; s observation: This is one of four fact checks involving a claim contained in the announcement by the Club d &apos; Agneur television of Peto Aurourke.
