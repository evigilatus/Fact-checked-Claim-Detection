Dave Pratt, President of the Republic, says in conservative radio shows that Soros is behind large fund-raising from Abigail Spanberger, a rival democracy. According to reports submitted to the Federal Electoral Commission, Spanger raised $4.5 million as at 25 September. This was nearly twice the amount of $2.3 million raised by Pratt, or a difference of $2.2 million. Pratt says the Soros organizations are responsible for the teams. \"I got $2.2 million from Act Blue,\" Pratt said during the 21 October interview on the Breitbart News on Sunday. It's possible your audience knows who they are, right? But this is George Soros' resistance group. This is not even the prevailing democracy. This is the group conducting riots in Portland, which encourages violence and gangs rather than jobs.\" Bright said during the October 22 interview at the John Frederick Gallery in Portsmouth. \"I have raised $3 million in the last three months, which he has not heard about, from Nancy Pelosi and Act Blue, a group supported by George Soros,\" Bright said during an interview on 16 October on WRVA news in Richmond. \"It's her largest group that collects money, and this is the group behind the resistance movement across the United States.\" Soros has been on the news lately. Some conservatives - including the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson from Virginia Beach - have been accused of financing the convoy of immigrants from Honduras to the United States - an accusation that the billionaires say is wrong and for which no supporting evidence has been shown. On October 22, a pipe bomb was found in the Pitt Soros mailbox near New York City, one of at least 14 explosives sent by mail late in October to President Donald Trump's critics. We wondered whether Pratt was right to claim that the Spanger campaign received $2.2 million from a Sorus-controlled group called Act Blue. Let's take a look. What's a \"Blu\"? Act Blue is a non-profit organization that provides a software platform for people to contribute to democratic campaigns through personal computers and cell phones. If you donate to a democratic candidate on his website, there is a good chance that Act Blue will be the channel that sends your money to the campaign - like Bayball is the channel for many purchases on the Internet. Since its establishment in 2005, the Blue Law has said that it has spent $3 billion on democratic candidates and \"progressive\" issues. Blue Spaniard Act Blue is used, and has received several thousand individual contributions through the platform. These statements totalled approximately $2.2 million as at 25 September, the most recent date for reporting financial expenditures available when Pratt made statements. Sorus is among the millions of people who have contributed through Act Blue, according to Chris Flemming, the spokesperson for non-profit organizations. Flemming said: \"He gave Soros through the blue book, not the blue one.\" \"Anybody can be given through blue action.\" Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, Flemming refused to make the total contribution of Soros to the candidates through Act Blue. He stressed, however, that Soros did not financially support the Blue Law and did not play a role in its operations. He said, \"The blue act has nothing to do with George Soros.\" Nor did Soros personally give money to the Spanberger campaign or to any democracy running for Congress during this two-year electoral cycle, according to the records of the Federal Electoral Commission. We asked Pratt for his explanation for Pratt's campaign to substantiate the candidate's claim that the blue document \"is George Soros Resistance Group.\" Katie Bright, spokesperson for Pratt, sent an article from the United States today and blogs from two conservative websites: Humanitarian Events and Daily Signal. On March 20, 2017, the United States of America published today a story entitled \"George Soros' bachelor group weighs the funding of activists against Trump.\" The article states that an indivisible group - a group seeking to build a \"resistance\" to President Donald Trump's agenda - is seeking support (with success) from the Alliance for Democracy, an activist organization that helped Soros find in 2005 to raise funds through the Blue Law. On February 10, 2017, the Daily Signal reported that a member of the Board of Directors of Indiverisable had previously been working in a group funded by Soros, and another member was now working in an organization that had received money from billionaires. This shows, according to the blog, that Soros has \"broad links\" to insulation. The blog says \"more money\" to \"unforgettable.\" Humanitarian Events - July 7, 2009 - Act Blue called the word \"extreme agendas such as Soros and action.\" As evidence, I wrote that \"Sorros donated $6,900 directly to Akt Blue\" on May 11, 2008. Flemming said this wrong; Soros contributed the sum \"through\" the blue work of Scott Klip, a Nebraska democracy who was a candidate for the United States Senate. Our judgment says Pratt to Spanger, \"I got 2.2 million dollars for Atop Blue... this is George Soros' resistance group.\" Pratt places Soros, on which many conservative binoculars focus, unreasonably, as the force behind the Spaniard campaign. Actop Blue is not an organization controlled by Soros. It is a non-profit group that provides a software platform that allows people to contribute to democratic candidates and issues through their personal computers and mobile phones. \"Actop Blue\" is a channel, which does not raise political money. As of 25 September, Spanger had raised approximately $2.2 million through the Blue Code. The money came from several thousand individuals, not Soros. The Spanberger campaign - sometimes through third-hand or fourth-hand ties - is artificial and deceiving. We're assessing a fire-proof statement.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01335"}
