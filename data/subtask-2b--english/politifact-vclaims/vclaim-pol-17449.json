The post (which wrongly says 70 hostages were held) features images of Sanders, Iran\u2019s former leader Ayatollah Khomeini and President Jimmy Carter and says:\n\"Socialist Workers Party leader Bernie Sanders supported Ayatollah Khomeini against the US, condemned president Carter for imperialism, and accused the hostages of being CIA spies.\n\"Is this what Democrats stand for? Bernie Sanders for president? Maybe in Iran. Not in the US.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis claim exaggerates Sanders\u2019 involvement in the Socialist Workers Party and wrongly says Sanders, like the party, labeled some of the hostages spies.\u00a0\nSanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, supported the Socialist Workers Party and spoke at some of the organization\u2019s events in the 1980s, but he was neither the leader nor a member. The organization did criticize the Carter administration\u2019s approach to the crisis and suggested some of the embassy hostages were spies. But Sanders did not.\nSocialist Workers Party position on Iran crisis\nThe post\u2019s claims appear to come from a January 2020 Daily Beast opinion column by Ronald Radosh headlined, \"When Iran Took Americans Hostage, Bernie Backed Iran\u2019s Defenders.\"\nThe Socialist Workers Party is a far-left revolutionary group that originally supported Leon Trotsky, a Soviet communist and Marxist theorist whose beliefs are commonly known as \"Trotskyism.\"\nIn the piece, Radosh wrote that in 1980, Sanders \"aligned himself with the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), the self-proclaimed Trotskyist revolutionary party. (The column goes too far in saying Sanders joined the party.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe social media post inaccurately jumbles this information. Here\u2019s the historical context.\nIn 1979, Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah of Iran, who had been installed and supported by successive U.S. administrations. Militants took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 \u2014 the day Ronald Reagan assumed the presidency from Carter, who had faced wide public disapproval over the protracted crisis.\nThe Socialist Workers Party criticized the U.S. government\u2019s approach during the crisis, writing in its newsletter The Militant that Carter\u2019s administration was \"defying the wishes of the vast majority of the American people\" and called on the government to meet Khomeini\u2019s demands, as well as suggesting that some of the hostages were spies.\nAt the time of the hostage crisis, Sanders was in Vermont, running for mayor of Burlington as an independent, though he identified himself at the time as a socialist. Still, we could find no record of any public statements by Sanders on the crisis.\nSanders\u2019 Socialist Workers Party ties\nSanders, who was mayor from 1981 to 1989, was not a member of the Socialist Workers Party during or after the Iran hostage crisis, according to multiple contemporaneous news reports.\u00a0\nBut Sanders was affiliated with the party, even though Vermont in 1980 did not have a branch, according to The Militant. Sanders served as one of the Vermont Electoral College electors for SWP leader and presidential candidate Andrew Pulley. But Pulley\u2019s candidacy was futile, because he was only 29 years old at the time, too young to be president under the U.S. Constitution (the minimum age is 35).\nSanders also spoke at some of the party\u2019s campaign events in 1982 and 1984.\nIn 1980, Sanders said he didn\u2019t support all of the party\u2019s positions, telling the Rutland Daily Herald newspaper (hat-tip Snopes): \"Although I am not in agreement with the SWP on all issues, I strongly support that party\u2019s attempt to become a nucleus for a national labor party, which will fight for the interests of low-income and working people.\"\nSanders' relationship with the party seems to have largely diminished since then, and he hasn\u2019t publicly addressed his affiliation with the organization during his current campaign for president.\u00a0\nA Sanders campaign spokesperson referred us to their comment for the Snopes story: \"Sen. Sanders did not think the hostages were spies nor did he support their captivity. Any suggestion otherwise is nonsense.\"\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17449"}
