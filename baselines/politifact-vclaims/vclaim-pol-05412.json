Joseph Stalin said, \u2018If you want to bring America down, you have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.\u2019 We, the people, can stop that decline.\"\nThe problem is that in all likelihood, this is not a real quote from the former Soviet leader. Stalin led the communist nation from the 1920s until his death in 1953, and it is believed that millions died during his regime.\nSearches for the quote do not turn up in any history books, scholarly works or primary sources. Mostly it\u2019s just social media sharables with the quote text next to a picture of Stalin.\nOur friends over at Snopes looked into a similar quote and concluded that it\u2019s \"highly unlikely that Stalin ever spoke these words.\" It seems dubious that Stalin would say something like this, as the quote, in a sense, compliments America for its strengths, Snopes noted.\nWe searched through an online Stalin Archive and an online library compiled by the University of Pennsylvania. Our searches came up empty.\nIt\u2019s unclear where this quote originated. The earliest use of the quote Snopes found was in a 1983 letter to the editor in a Kansas newspaper.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
