(Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nThe claim isn\u2019t remotely true, and the ill-conceived story itself provides evidence of that.\nThe nonsensical claim\nThe story begins with a paragraph largely restating the headline, then embeds a tweet making the same outlandish claim.\nThe story then links to and quotes the resolution in question, 2021 Assembly Resolution 3, proposed by state Rep. Scott Allen, R-Waukesha. The Republican-controlled Assembly passed the bill Jan. 4 by a voice vote near the end of inauguration ceremonies, which most Democrats skipped over concerns that COVID-19 precautions were inadequate.\nBut the story ignores that the bill says nothing about decertifying.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the actual closing of the bill, where the \"Resolved\" sections indicate the action it is seeking:\nResolved by the assembly, That: the Wisconsin State Assembly recognizes that the most important function for a government is to conduct fair and honest elections that follow the duly enacted law; and, be it further\nResolved, That when there are significant portions of the population that question the integrity of the elections due to the failure of election officials to follow the letter of the law, it is incumbent upon the legislature to address the issues that are in question; and, be it further\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolved, That the members of the Wisconsin State Assembly place the redress to these and other election law violations and failed administrative procedures as its highest priority and shall take up legislation crafted to ensure civil officers follow the laws as written.\nIt doesn\u2019t take a degree in English literature to discern this doesn\u2019t award anything to President Donald Trump. Trump lost Wisconsin to former Vice President Joe Biden by 20,000 votes, as confirmed by a canvas and recount.\nThe bill simply says the Legislature should make it a priority to take up legislation ensuring election officials follow laws as written.\nThe timeline in the Gateway Pundit story is also divorced from reality. The \"Thursday\" cited here would be a day after Congress meets to finalize the election results.\u00a0\nAnd the deadline for action to alter Wisconsin\u2019s slate of electors has long-since passed. The state\u2019s 10 Biden electors cast their votes on Dec. 14. As expected based on election returns confirmed as fair and legitimate by election and government officials from both parties nationwide, that gave Biden a 306 to 232 victory over Trump, handing him the White House.\nGateway Pundit Editor Jim Hoft did not immediately reply to an email seeking evidence of this article\u2019s claim.\nAllen declined to comment on how the story characterized his resolution, saying the text speaks for itself.\nOur ruling\nGateway Pundit, a regular purveyor of disinformation, says Wisconsin is introducing a resolution to decertify the state\u2019s election results and award its Electoral College votes to Trump.\nThe article conveniently includes the text of the bill, allowing readers to see for themselves this claim is 100% fabricated.\nThe bill simply says the Legislature would prioritize legislation addressing election laws. It says nothing remotely related to decertification or awarding the state to Trump. And in any case, the state\u2019s electoral votes were already cast for Biden weeks ago.\nThis is disinformation in its most transparent form.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19115"}
