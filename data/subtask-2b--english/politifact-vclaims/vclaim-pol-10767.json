Nathan Deal, a Republican, offered some insight in a front-page article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that had a few readers and organizations questioning its accuracy. A couple of them contacted PolitiFact Georgia to get some answers.\n\nState officials have said the law will result in at least 620,000 additional Georgians being eligible for its Medicaid program, which they estimate will cost about $4.5 billion over 10 years. Georgia was one of about two dozen states to join the lawsuit against the health care law that was reviewed by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"To pay for the expansion without tax increases would require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget,\" Robinson said. \"And that\u2019s after we\u2019ve shaved off billions in state spending since the beginning of the Great Recession.\"\n\nCutting a quarter of the state budget? That could be catastrophic.\n\nThe Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, which has concluded the health care law will save Georgia money, quickly disputed Robinson\u2019s math in a news release. The institute, which frequently takes moderate to liberal positions on many Georgia fiscal issues, also pressed the state to provide information detailing how it calculated the $4.5 billion estimate on state finances.\n\n\"It makes the issue sound bigger than it is,\" Tim Sweeney, the institute\u2019s director of health policy, said of Robinson\u2019s claim in a telephone interview. \"We want to make sure it\u2019s out there that it\u2019s not true.\"\n\nThe Georgia General Assembly adopted a $19.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.\n\nThe health care law expands Medicaid eligibility in 2014 to nearly all Americans under 65 with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. An additional 5 percent is disregarded when determining income eligibility, which effectively raises the threshold to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The 2012 federal poverty level for a family of four in Georgia is $23,050. The number of Georgia enrollees is projected to rise from 1.6 million to nearly 2.3 million as a result of the the law.\n\nThe law provides that the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these individuals through 2016. In the following years, the federal payment level gradually decreases, to a minimum of 90 percent.\n\nThe impact on state government in Fiscal Year 2015 is expected to be about $225 million, according to the state Department of Community Health. The annual impact of the health care law on Georgia\u2019s Medicaid program rises by about $100 million a year between fiscal years 2016 and 2022, the state estimates. Georgia\u2019s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends June 30.\n\nAs we noted, the state budget is $19.3 billion. If the state had to cut a quarter of its current budget, that figure would be about $4.825 billion.\n\nBut the health care law\u2019s impact on Medicaid spending in Georgia is projected to stretch over 10 years, not one year. The Fiscal Year 2014 impact on Medicaid spending is estimated to be about $80 million, which would be about 2 percent of the state budget if the budget remains at its current levels.\n\nRobinson, after an initial refusal to discuss the matter, admitted he erred.\n\n\"What I said isn\u2019t accurate,\" he told us. \"I messed up. I was correctly quoted by the reporter.\"\n\nRobinson said his underlying point was that the health care law would result in potentially a major financial commitment from the state for Medicaid payments.\n\n\"The way I said it made it sound like we\u2019re spending $4.5 billion more per year. That\u2019s not true,\" Robinson wrote us via email. \"I SHOULD have said \u2018Over 10 years, the new mandated spending will total a quarter of what the state spends on ALL services in its annual budget.\"\n\nIndeed. If he had said the potential impact of the health care law on Medicaid is equivalent to a quarter of the state\u2019s budget, Robinson would have earned a True rating.\n\nBut our rating of his actual statement as it appeared in the newspaper: False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10767"}
