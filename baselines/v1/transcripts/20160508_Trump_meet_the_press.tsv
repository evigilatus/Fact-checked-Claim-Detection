0001	CHUCK TODD	This Sunday, the Republican party coming apart.
0002	DONALD TRUMP	It really looks like a massive victory.
0003	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump wraps up the Republican nomination and effectively tells G.O.P.
0004	CHUCK TODD	leaders, "It's my party and you can cry if you want to."
0005	DONALD TRUMP	Our thing, its very simple, its make America great again.
0006	CHUCK TODD	My interview with the Republican party's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump.
0007	CHUCK TODD	Plus, it's a simple fact, divided parties lose elections.
0008	CHUCK TODD	Republican voters embrace Trump, the Republican leadership says, "No way."
0009	SPEAKER PAUL RYAN	I'm just not ready to do that at this point.
0010	CHUCK TODD	Can Donald Trump become the first candidate in more than half a century to win an election without a united party behind him?
0011	CHUCK TODD	Also, don't look now, but the general election has already begun.
0012	DONALD TRUMP	I can focus on Hillary.
0013	DONALD TRUMP	Crooked Hillary.
0014	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	He doesn't think much of equal pay for women because, of course, he doesn't think much of women.
0015	CHUCK TODD	Even S.N.L.
0016	CHUCK TODD	is looking towards November.
0017	DANA CARVEY	And now we've landed on the exciting presidential matchup between a godless, liberal Democrat and Hillary Clinton.
0018	CHUCK TODD	Joining me for insight and analysis this Sunday morning are Eugene Robinson, PulitzerPrizewinning columnist for The Washington Post, Andrea Mitchell of NBC News, Matt Bai, national political correspondent for Yahoo News, and Republican strategist and pollster, Kellyanne Conway.
0019	CHUCK TODD	Welcome to Sunday.
0020	CHUCK TODD	It's Meet the Press.
0021	ANNOUNCER	From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.
0022	CHUCK TODD	Good Sunday morning, happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there watching.
0023	CHUCK TODD	This may well be this generation's defining moment in American politics, particularly for Republicans.
0024	CHUCK TODD	The Republican party splitting apart as it turns its back on its new presumptive nominee Donald Trump.
0025	CHUCK TODD	What we're witnessing is nothing short of what you might call tissue rejection.
0026	CHUCK TODD	Conservatives who warn that Trump would ultimately prove he's not one of them, are having their own, "I told you so" moment.
0027	CHUCK TODD	During the primaries, Trump said he was opposed to raising the minimum wage.
0028	CHUCK TODD	Now he says he's open to raising it.
0029	CHUCK TODD	During the primaries, Trump put out a plan lowering taxes on everybody, including the wealthy, now he says he's open to raising taxes for the wealthiest Americans.
0030	CHUCK TODD	And during the primaries, Trump insisted over and over again he would selffund his campaign, and now he says he's building a worldclass finance organization aimed at raising money for his campaign.
0031	CHUCK TODD	That, and so much more, has led a long parade of prominent Republicans to say either they can't support Trump or they have to think it over.
0032	CHUCK TODD	We'll get to my interview with Donald Trump in just a moment, but one thing is clear.
0033	CHUCK TODD	He begins his campaign as a the presumptive nominee of a party, whose leadership A) didn't want him, and B) is deeply reluctant to rally around him.
0034	CHUCK TODD	In short, is the Republican party wigging out?
0035	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0036	SPEAKER PAUL RYAN	I'm not there right now.
0037	SPEAKER PAUL RYAN	And I hope to though, and I want to.
0038	SPEAKER PAUL RYAN	But I think what is required is that we unify this party.
0039	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump is facing a rejection from Republican party leaders that is unprecedented in modern politics.
0040	SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM	I think Donald Trump's a kind of man.
0041	SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM	I'm not going to support somebody I don't believe is a reliable Republican conservative.
0042	CHUCK TODD	Nebraska senator Ben Sasse says, "A thirdparty candidate is the only solution."
0043	CHUCK TODD	Quote, "This is America.
0044	CHUCK TODD	If both choices stink, we reject them and go bigger."
0045	CHUCK TODD	The only two living Republican presidents, both Bushes, are also no's, refusing to endorse Trump and skipping the Republican Convention after a campaign of insults to Jeb.
0046	DONALD TRUMP	Hes low energy.
0047	DONALD TRUMP	Let's be sure.
0048	CHUCK TODD	The 2012 nominee, also a no, is being courted to run as an independent.
0049	CHUCK TODD	So far, Mitt Romney is not interested.
0050	CHUCK TODD	The 2008 nominee, with a primary in August, is a reluctant yes, but also staying away from Cleveland in July.
0051	SEN. JOHN MCCAIN	If there is a Donald Trump at the top of the ticket, I have no doubt that this may be the race of my life.
0052	CHUCK TODD	Even the chair of the convention is sending a signal to donors and voters that it's okay to stay on the bench.
0053	SPEAKER PAUL RYAN	I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee.
0054	DONALD TRUMP	I didn't get Paul Ryan.
0055	DONALD TRUMP	I don't know what happened.
0056	DONALD TRUMP	I don't know.
0057	DONALD TRUMP	All of a sudden, he wants to be cute.
0058	DONALD TRUMP	But, you know, we'll see.
0059	CHUCK TODD	With a meeting planned in Washington next week, the chill could thaw.
0060	CHUCK TODD	And some Trump skeptics are coming around, including Rick Perry, who said this just months ago
0061	GOV. RICK PERRY	Donald Trump's candidacy is a cancer on conservatism.
0062	CHUCK TODD	But Trump begins the general election as a scarred candidate, trailing by 23 points among women, and leading by just three points among men.
0063	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	He doesn't think much of equal pay for women because, of course, he doesn't think much of women, it turns out.
0064	CHUCK TODD	But for Trump, the attacks are going to be personal.
0065	DONALD TRUMP	And she was a total enabler.
0066	DONALD TRUMP	She would go after these women and destroy their lives.
0067	DONALD TRUMP	I mean, have you ever read what Hillary Clinton did to the women that Bill Clinton had affairs with?
0068	DONALD TRUMP	And they're going after me with women?
0069	DONALD TRUMP	Give me a break, folks.
0070	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0071	CHUCK TODD	Yesterday I spoke with Mr. Trump.
0072	CHUCK TODD	And I began by asking if he was surprised to have already wrapped up the Republican nomination.
0073	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0074	DONALD TRUMP	Well, I thought I'd do it.
0075	DONALD TRUMP	I didn't know I was going to do it this early.
0076	DONALD TRUMP	I assumed that Hillary would be watching me, as opposed to me watching Hillary.
0077	DONALD TRUMP	So that's good.
0078	DONALD TRUMP	And it's going to be an interesting things, because Bernie Sanders is not being treated fairly.
0079	DONALD TRUMP	Not being treated fairly.
0080	DONALD TRUMP	You know, it's a rigged system against him also.
0081	DONALD TRUMP	I'm no Bernie fan, I can tell you that.
0082	DONALD TRUMP	But it is a rigged system.
0083	CHUCK TODD	Do you believe the system is the Republican system was pretty rigged too, even though you're winning it?
0084	DONALD TRUMP	Yeah, totally rigged.
0085	DONALD TRUMP	It was totally rigged.
0086	DONALD TRUMP	And it was only that I was winning by so much.
0087	DONALD TRUMP	I was winning in landslides every week.
0088	DONALD TRUMP	And if I weren't, I wouldn't have been able to do it, because it was dictated by the bosses.
0089	DONALD TRUMP	But you know what, I'm happy with it.
0090	DONALD TRUMP	It's like a boxer.
0091	DONALD TRUMP	You have to go and you have to knock out the opponent.
0092	DONALD TRUMP	We won so many landslide states, especially the last seven or eight, that you know, there was nothing much they could do about it.
0093	DONALD TRUMP	But it's not a good system
0094	CHUCK TODD	You know, you complained about the system a lot.
0095	CHUCK TODD	I'm curious, are you now more open to sameday voter registration, allowing independents to vote in any primary they want?
0096	CHUCK TODD	Are you going to be somebody that's going to advocate for those positions now, to make it easier to vote, since your voters had a hard time?
0097	DONALD TRUMP	Well, you can't expand the party that way.
0098	DONALD TRUMP	And you know, we've done it both ways.
0099	DONALD TRUMP	I've always done better when independents could cross over, and frankly when Democrats could cross over.
0100	DONALD TRUMP	You know, in New York when we were doing the voting, they interviewed  a lot of people interviewed the people at the voting booths, that you know, manned the voting booths.
0101	DONALD TRUMP	And they were saying that they've never seen anything like it
0102	CHUCK TODD	Well, they banned same day you realize that in New York, had there been same day voter registration those people could have voted.
0103	CHUCK TODD	So are you for that?
0104	DONALD TRUMP	Well, I'll tell you what.
0105	DONALD TRUMP	But they said that they've never seen so many Democrats wanting to vote for Trump.
0106	DONALD TRUMP	They were by the thousands.
0107	DONALD TRUMP	And I will say this.
0108	DONALD TRUMP	On Election Day, we're going to do very well in New York.
0109	DONALD TRUMP	But the people were saying to the press that they'd never seen anything like it.
0110	DONALD TRUMP	They've been there for 30 and 40 years doing this kind of stuff.
0111	CHUCK TODD	But you're not but I'm just curious
0112	DONALD TRUMP	where Democrats are going over.
0113	CHUCK TODD	do you want to see the voting laws changed to make it easier to vote?
0114	DONALD TRUMP	I want to see voting laws so that people that are citizens can vote.
0115	DONALD TRUMP	Not so people that can walk off the street and can vote, or so that illegal immigrants can vote
0116	CHUCK TODD	So you're not for sameday voter registration?
0117	DONALD TRUMP	No, no.
0118	DONALD TRUMP	I want to make the voting laws so that people that it doesn't make any difference how they do it.
0119	DONALD TRUMP	But I don't think people should sneak in through the cracks.
0120	DONALD TRUMP	You have to have  And whether that's an ID or any way you want to do it.
0121	DONALD TRUMP	But you have to be a citizen to vote.
0122	CHUCK TODD	Well, of course.
0123	CHUCK TODD	That is the law as it stands already.
0124	CHUCK TODD	Let me ask
0125	DONALD TRUMP	No, it's not.
0126	DONALD TRUMP	I mean, you have places where people just walk in and vote.
0127	CHUCK TODD	We don't have a lot of time.
0128	CHUCK TODD	I want to move on here.
0129	CHUCK TODD	Let me talk about the Paul Ryan situation.
0130	CHUCK TODD	Frankly, you seem pretty annoyed by this.
0131	CHUCK TODD	Are you?
0132	DONALD TRUMP	No.
0133	DONALD TRUMP	It's just the way it is.
0134	DONALD TRUMP	I don't think it hurts me at all.
0135	DONALD TRUMP	And I'd like to have his support, but if he doesn't want to support me that's fine.
0136	DONALD TRUMP	And we have to go about it.
0137	DONALD TRUMP	Look, I'm going to get millions and millions of votes more than the Republicans would have gotten.
0138	DONALD TRUMP	If you look at the numbers, I think right now, or I will be this week or next week, in the history of the Republican Party, nobody has ever gotten so many votes as I have.
0139	DONALD TRUMP	I've beaten Eisenhower and Nixon and Reagan and everybody.
0140	DONALD TRUMP	And we have a tremendous group of people that's voting.
0141	DONALD TRUMP	And remember, I have a lot of states left.
0142	DONALD TRUMP	And if you look at the percentages I'm winning, I mean, I got 62 percent in New York, and I got these massive numbers all over.
0143	DONALD TRUMP	And I have three candidates.
0144	DONALD TRUMP	I was having to beat three candidates.
0145	DONALD TRUMP	You know, nobody ever mentions that, that you get 62 percent, but it's not against just one person.
0146	DONALD TRUMP	It's against, in this case, three.
0147	DONALD TRUMP	And during the process
0148	CHUCK TODD	And so your case to Paul Ryan is, "Hey, the voters have decided.
0149	CHUCK TODD	Get on board."
0150	DONALD TRUMP	Well, I would say that's true.
0151	DONALD TRUMP	I mean, to be honest.
0152	DONALD TRUMP	I like Paul Ryan.
0153	DONALD TRUMP	I think he's a very good guy.
0154	DONALD TRUMP	He called me three weeks ago, and he was so supportive.
0155	DONALD TRUMP	It was amazing.
0156	DONALD TRUMP	And I never thought a thing like this.
0157	DONALD TRUMP	I got blindsided by this
0158	CHUCK TODD	So you're stunned.
0159	CHUCK TODD	You feel blindsided by him?
0160	DONALD TRUMP	No, I would say stunned is a little bit it's politics.
0161	DONALD TRUMP	I'm never stunned by anything that happens in politics.
0162	DONALD TRUMP	But, so Im not  yeah, I was blindsided a little bit, because he spoke to me three weeks ago, and it was a very nice call, a very encouraging call.
0163	DONALD TRUMP	I was doing well.
0164	DONALD TRUMP	He called me, I think, to congratulate me about New York, 'cause I won by massive numbers.
0165	DONALD TRUMP	I won everything.
0166	DONALD TRUMP	And then the next week, I won the five states in a row by all landslide numbers.
0167	DONALD TRUMP	And he called me to congratulate me.
0168	DONALD TRUMP	Couldn't have been nicer.
0169	DONALD TRUMP	And again, I have a nice relationship with him.
0170	DONALD TRUMP	Don't know him well.
0171	DONALD TRUMP	Met him one time.
0172	DONALD TRUMP	But have a nice relationship with him.
0173	DONALD TRUMP	And then all of a sudden, he gets on and he does this number.
0174	DONALD TRUMP	So I'm not exactly sure what he has in mind.
0175	DONALD TRUMP	But that's okay
0176	CHUCK TODD	If he can't endorse you, do you think he should be chair of the Convention?
0177	DONALD TRUMP	I don't want to mention now.
0178	DONALD TRUMP	I'll see after.
0179	DONALD TRUMP	I will give you a very solid answer, if that happens, about one minute after that happens.
0180	DONALD TRUMP	Okay?
0181	DONALD TRUMP	But there's no reason to give it right now.
0182	DONALD TRUMP	But I'll be very quick with the answer.
0183	DONALD TRUMP	Let's see what happens
0184	CHUCK TODD	Well, it sounds like I know what the answer is, but you don't want to say it yet.
0185	CHUCK TODD	You don't want to sound you're not here you don't want to issue threats.
0186	DONALD TRUMP	No, inappropriate.
0187	DONALD TRUMP	Well see.
0188	CHUCK TODD	you're not going to issue a public threat?
0189	DONALD TRUMP	I don't think that's going to happen.
0190	DONALD TRUMP	You know, the party's come together.
0191	DONALD TRUMP	I have tremendous numbers of endorsements.
0192	DONALD TRUMP	I'm never going to get Romney's endorsement.
0193	DONALD TRUMP	He choked.
0194	DONALD TRUMP	He blew the last election.
0195	DONALD TRUMP	I'm never going to get that.
0196	DONALD TRUMP	I'm never going to get Bush's election.
0197	DONALD TRUMP	You know, he thought I was too rough on him.
0198	DONALD TRUMP	He doesn't say that he spent $10 million on negative ads.
0199	DONALD TRUMP	But Jeb Bush, I was tough on him, and he was trying to be tough on me, but he's not a very tough guy.
0200	DONALD TRUMP	But you know, I was very tough on him.
0201	DONALD TRUMP	But he spent $10 million or $12 million on negative ads on me.
0202	DONALD TRUMP	So why shouldnt I be?
0203	DONALD TRUMP	The fact is
0204	CHUCK TODD	You know
0205	DONALD TRUMP	and by the way, Chuck.
0206	DONALD TRUMP	Very important.
0207	DONALD TRUMP	He signed a pledge.
0208	DONALD TRUMP	He pledged that he would support the nominee.
0209	DONALD TRUMP	And so did this lightweight, Lindsey Graham.
0210	DONALD TRUMP	He pledged that he would support the nominee.
0211	DONALD TRUMP	They ran.
0212	DONALD TRUMP	They lost
0213	CHUCK TODD	You threatened to back away from that pledge a lot, for various reasons
0214	DONALD TRUMP	No, no, no.
0215	DONALD TRUMP	I didn't back away.
0216	DONALD TRUMP	In fact, one of the reasons I didn't back away is that I happen to be, despite what a few people think, I happen to be a very honorable guy.
0217	DONALD TRUMP	I signed a pledge.
0218	DONALD TRUMP	And that's a binding pledge.
0219	DONALD TRUMP	You know, I heard, "It's not binding."
0220	DONALD TRUMP	Well, it is a binding pledge.
0221	DONALD TRUMP	I have the best lawyers in the world.
0222	DONALD TRUMP	They say it's an absolutely binding pledge.
0223	DONALD TRUMP	And I intended it to be binding.
0224	CHUCK TODD	Well, it was very binding for South Carolina.
0225	CHUCK TODD	That was the only way to get on the ballot.
0226	DONALD TRUMP	Well, remember  Chuck, Chuck, remember this.
0227	DONALD TRUMP	Jeb Bush signed a pledge.
0228	DONALD TRUMP	A binding pledge.
0229	DONALD TRUMP	Lindsey Graham signed a binding pledge that they would endorse.
0230	DONALD TRUMP	That they would support and endorse.
0231	DONALD TRUMP	That's what it says.
0232	DONALD TRUMP	Now they're breaking.
0233	DONALD TRUMP	You know, that's a question of honor.
0234	DONALD TRUMP	They are not honorable people when they do that.
0235	DONALD TRUMP	Because they're going against the pledge
0236	CHUCK TODD	Let me ask you about Mitt Romney.
0237	CHUCK TODD	As you know, there's chatter that he's being recruited to run as an independent.
0238	CHUCK TODD	I know you say you don't care that you have his support.
0239	CHUCK TODD	But if you could have a sitdown with Mitt Romney, you know, he came to you as sort of a penitent man.
0240	CHUCK TODD	You know, he came to you when he was wanting your endorsement.
0241	CHUCK TODD	Have you thought about traveling to him and seeing if you can sort of calm the waters with him at all?
0242	CHUCK TODD	And if you did, what would you say to him?
0243	DONALD TRUMP	Well, here's the story.
0244	DONALD TRUMP	I helped Mitt a lot.
0245	DONALD TRUMP	I raised a lot of money for him.
0246	DONALD TRUMP	I ruined the carpet in my apartments, I had so many people come.
0247	DONALD TRUMP	We actually had to have two fundraisers because there were so many people, for his wife, who is a fantastic woman, by the way.
0248	DONALD TRUMP	I had these fundraisers in my apartment.
0249	DONALD TRUMP	They called me for help.
0250	DONALD TRUMP	And I did robocalls.
0251	DONALD TRUMP	I did speeches for him.
0252	DONALD TRUMP	I did everything during the primary season.
0253	DONALD TRUMP	During the election season, for some reason, they should have used me in Florida.
0254	DONALD TRUMP	He would have won Florida.
0255	DONALD TRUMP	But they had this, you know, campaign manager, Stewart whatever, who didn't like Donald Trump.
0256	DONALD TRUMP	He thought Donald Trump was too tough and too controversial, and don't use him.
0257	DONALD TRUMP	So they didn't use me, and that was okay.
0258	DONALD TRUMP	When it came down to the convention, I wasn't a part of the convention, and that was okay.
0259	DONALD TRUMP	What happened is I was rough on Mitt because I didn't think they treated me properly.
0260	DONALD TRUMP	I helped him, really helped him.
0261	DONALD TRUMP	Gave him a lot of money.
0262	DONALD TRUMP	Helped him with robocalls.
0263	DONALD TRUMP	Every single robocall I made, he won that state.
0264	DONALD TRUMP	Every single speech I made, he won the state, in terms of the primaries.
0265	DONALD TRUMP	When it came time to the general election, I waited for the call.
0266	DONALD TRUMP	I didn't care.
0267	DONALD TRUMP	Look, if they don't want to call me, that's okay.
0268	DONALD TRUMP	I'm a busy man.
0269	DONALD TRUMP	I have a lot of things to do.
0270	DONALD TRUMP	But if I would have been asked to help him in Florida, you saw what I did in Florida.
0271	DONALD TRUMP	I won in a landslide.
0272	DONALD TRUMP	I would have helped him.
0273	DONALD TRUMP	I certainly could have gotten him over the ledge.
0274	CHUCK TODD	Let me
0275	DONALD TRUMP	Wait a minute.
0276	CHUCK TODD	Okay.
0277	DONALD TRUMP	So if Mitt Romney did that, I would be happy to talk to him.
0278	DONALD TRUMP	I think it's great.
0279	DONALD TRUMP	And I would be because I respect him
0280	CHUCK TODD	You want him to thank you first, for 2012, before you will reach out to him
0281	DONALD TRUMP	I helped  I helped Mitt Romney a lot.
0282	CHUCK TODD	And you feel like he was ungrateful
0283	DONALD TRUMP	I did.
0284	DONALD TRUMP	I believe I won him, or helped him win, five states that he was going to lose in the primaries, okay
0285	CHUCK TODD	Sounds like you think he was ungrateful.
0286	CHUCK TODD	You think he's been ungrateful?
0287	DONALD TRUMP	He was.
0288	DONALD TRUMP	He was ungrateful.
0289	DONALD TRUMP	Which is okay.
0290	DONALD TRUMP	A lot of people are ungrateful.
0291	DONALD TRUMP	But he was ungrateful.
0292	DONALD TRUMP	He did notThey did not respond accordingly.
0293	DONALD TRUMP	And that's okay.
0294	CHUCK TODD	Alright.
0295	DONALD TRUMP	But let's see what happens.
0296	DONALD TRUMP	Let's see what happens
0297	CHUCK TODD	Let me move on.
0298	CHUCK TODD	Let me move on some issue things.
0299	CHUCK TODD	There's a few things that some people think are contradictions, so I want to see if I can pin you down here.
0300	CHUCK TODD	The issue of taxes.
0301	CHUCK TODD	Your tax plan is one where the biggest beneficiaries are the 0.1 percent when it comes to raw dollars that will be saved among taxes.
0302	CHUCK TODD	But then in an interview earlier this week, you seemed to say, "You know what, my tax plan, it's not set in stone.
0303	CHUCK TODD	And maybe I'll raise taxes.
0304	CHUCK TODD	Maybe I'll actually raise taxes on the rich."
0305	CHUCK TODD	So I guess, which is it?
0306	CHUCK TODD	Are you willing to raise taxes on 0.1 percent or not
0307	DONALD TRUMP	It's definitely no, no, no.
0308	DONALD TRUMP	Let me explain how the world works, okay?
0309	DONALD TRUMP	I think nobody knows more about taxes than I do, and income than I do.
0310	DONALD TRUMP	But I'll explain how it all works.
0311	DONALD TRUMP	I come up with the biggest tax cut by far of any candidate.
0312	DONALD TRUMP	Anybody.
0313	DONALD TRUMP	And I put it in.
0314	DONALD TRUMP	But that doesn't mean that's what we're going to get.
0315	DONALD TRUMP	We have to negotiate.
0316	DONALD TRUMP	The thing I'm going to do is make sure the middle class gets good tax breaks.
0317	DONALD TRUMP	Because they have been absolutely shunned.
0318	DONALD TRUMP	The other thing, I'm going to fight very hard for business.
0319	DONALD TRUMP	For the wealthy, I think, frankly, it's going to go up.
0320	DONALD TRUMP	And you know what, it really should go up.
0321	DONALD TRUMP	Because the wealthy
0322	CHUCK TODD	The wealthy need to pay more taxes?
0323	CHUCK TODD	What do you define as wealthy, by the way
0324	DONALD TRUMP	No.
0325	DONALD TRUMP	No, let me explain somebody like me.
0326	DONALD TRUMP	Let me explain somethingsomebody like melet me explain something.
0327	DONALD TRUMP	I'm putting in a plan, Chuck.
0328	DONALD TRUMP	I have to negotiate now with senators and congressmen and lots of the fact that I put in a plan, it really is a floor.
0329	DONALD TRUMP	That's what it is.
0330	DONALD TRUMP	Whether we like it or not.
0331	DONALD TRUMP	So I put in my plan.
0332	DONALD TRUMP	It's quite simple to see.
0333	DONALD TRUMP	It's a simplification.
0334	DONALD TRUMP	We lower the number of brackets.
0335	DONALD TRUMP	We lower the taxes on the middle class, on business.
0336	DONALD TRUMP	And we lower the taxes on everybody, very substantially.
0337	DONALD TRUMP	But I have no illusions.
0338	DONALD TRUMP	I don't think that's going to be the final plan.
0339	DONALD TRUMP	Because they are going to come to me, including the Democrats and everybody else, they're going to come to me.
0340	DONALD TRUMP	They're going to want to negotiate.
0341	DONALD TRUMP	But that's a floor.
0342	DONALD TRUMP	That's where we're starting.
0343	CHUCK TODD	So is that
0344	DONALD TRUMP	Now, when it comes time to negotiate, I feel less concerned with the rich than I do with the middle class.
0345	CHUCK TODD	So it sounds like should we take that
0346	DONALD TRUMP	And I feel very concerned at that.
0347	CHUCK TODD	should we assume that most of your plans, then, we shouldn't take you at your word, as sort of that they're floors?
0348	CHUCK TODD	What you just described?
0349	CHUCK TODD	That, "You know what, it's my opening statement, but everything is negotiable"
0350	DONALD TRUMP	Its not a word.
0351	DONALD TRUMP	Excuse me.
0352	DONALD TRUMP	Excuse me.
0353	DONALD TRUMP	It's called life, Chuck.
0354	DONALD TRUMP	It's not my word, of course.
0355	DONALD TRUMP	I put in a proposal.
0356	DONALD TRUMP	You know what they are?
0357	DONALD TRUMP	They're really proposals.
0358	DONALD TRUMP	People can say it's a tax plan.
0359	DONALD TRUMP	It's really a tax proposal.
0360	DONALD TRUMP	Because after I put it in, and I think you know the Senate and Congress
0361	CHUCK TODD	Sure.
0362	CHUCK TODD	Yeah.
0363	DONALD TRUMP	you know as much as anybody, they start working with you, and they start fighting.
0364	DONALD TRUMP	And you know, let's see what happens.
0365	DONALD TRUMP	But I put in a proposal.
0366	DONALD TRUMP	Under my proposal, it's the biggest tax cut by far, of any candidate by far.
0367	DONALD TRUMP	But I'm not under the illusion that that's going to pass.
0368	DONALD TRUMP	They're going to come to me.
0369	DONALD TRUMP	They're going to want to raise it for the rich.
0370	DONALD TRUMP	Frankly, they're going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else.
0371	DONALD TRUMP	But the middle class has to be protected.
0372	DONALD TRUMP	The rich is probably going to end up paying more.
0373	DONALD TRUMP	And business might have to pay a little bit more.
0374	DONALD TRUMP	But we're giving a massive business tax cut.
0375	DONALD TRUMP	Remember this, we're the highest taxed nation in the world.
0376	DONALD TRUMP	But this is a tax Chuck, this is a tax proposal
0377	CHUCK TODD	Wait a minute.
0378	CHUCK TODD	Let me stop you there.
0379	CHUCK TODD	You just said, "Businesses might pay a little bit more."
0380	CHUCK TODD	You just said, "Business might pay a little bit more, but we're going to get 'em a massive tax cut."
0381	CHUCK TODD	You just said it within ten words.
0382	DONALD TRUMP	No, no.
0383	DONALD TRUMP	I didn't say it.
0384	DONALD TRUMP	Excuse me.
0385	DONALD TRUMP	I said they might have to pay a little bit more than my proposal, Chuck.
0386	DONALD TRUMP	I said they might have
0387	CHUCK TODD	Oh, your proposal.
0388	CHUCK TODD	Okay.
0389	CHUCK TODD	I just wanted to get that clear.
0390	DONALD TRUMP	yeah, than my proposal.
0391	CHUCK TODD	Fair enough.
0392	DONALD TRUMP	I'm not talking about more than they're paying now.
0393	CHUCK TODD	Got you.
0394	DONALD TRUMP	We're the highest taxed nation in the world.
0395	DONALD TRUMP	Our businesses pay more taxes than any businesses in the world.
0396	DONALD TRUMP	That's why companies are leaving.
0397	DONALD TRUMP	So they may have to pay a little bit more than my proposal, is what I mean.
0398	DONALD TRUMP	I assume you knew that.
0399	DONALD TRUMP	I assume you know that.
0400	CHUCK TODD	Got you.
0401	CHUCK TODD	Okay.
0402	CHUCK TODD	No, no, no, no.
0403	CHUCK TODD	I just wanted to clear that up.
0404	DONALD TRUMP	Okay, good.
0405	DONALD TRUMP	Good, I'm glad you cleared it up
0406	CHUCK TODD	Minimum wage.
0407	CHUCK TODD	Minimum wage.
0408	CHUCK TODD	At a debate, you know.
0409	CHUCK TODD	You remember what you said.
0410	CHUCK TODD	You thought you didn't want to touch it.
0411	CHUCK TODD	Now you're open to it.
0412	CHUCK TODD	What changed?
0413	DONALD TRUMP	Let me just tell you, I've been traveling the country for many months.
0414	DONALD TRUMP	Since June 16th.
0415	DONALD TRUMP	I'm all over.
0416	DONALD TRUMP	Today I'm in the state of Washington, where the arena right behind me, you probably hear, is packed with thousands and thousands of people.
0417	DONALD TRUMP	I'm doing that right after I finish you.
0418	DONALD TRUMP	I have seen what's going on.
0419	DONALD TRUMP	And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour.
0420	DONALD TRUMP	Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude.
0421	DONALD TRUMP	But I'd rather leave it to the states.
0422	DONALD TRUMP	Let the states decide.
0423	DONALD TRUMP	Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other.
0424	DONALD TRUMP	So you may have a governor 
0425	CHUCK TODD	Right.
0426	CHUCK TODD	You want the fed but should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states
0427	DONALD TRUMP	No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.
0428	DONALD TRUMP	And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck.
0429	DONALD TRUMP	So I like the idea of let the states decide.
0430	DONALD TRUMP	But I think people should get more.
0431	DONALD TRUMP	I think they're out there.
0432	DONALD TRUMP	They're working.
0433	DONALD TRUMP	It is a very low number.
0434	DONALD TRUMP	You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost.
0435	DONALD TRUMP	I mean, it's just I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour.
0436	DONALD TRUMP	But I would say let the states decide.
0437	CHUCK TODD	Another contradiction has been on your feelings toward Hillary Clinton.
0438	CHUCK TODD	In 2012, as she was leaving Secretary of State, you praised her.
0439	CHUCK TODD	You thought she did a good job.
0440	CHUCK TODD	You even sort of said, "You know what, she's not pushing her agenda.
0441	CHUCK TODD	She had to carry on somebody else's agenda."
0442	CHUCK TODD	Before that, you didn't fault her on the Iraq War vote because you said, "You know what, she got bad intelligence like a lot of other people got."
0443	CHUCK TODD	Now, you're saying
0444	DONALD TRUMP	I didn't get bad intelligence.
0445	DONALD TRUMP	I didn't get bad intelligence.
0446	CHUCK TODD	you say all I understand that.
0447	CHUCK TODD	But you kind of forgave her on that early on.
0448	CHUCK TODD	Now, you call her, "She's been crooked from the start."
0449	CHUCK TODD	I guess this goes back to which Donald Trump do we believe on your feelings toward Hillary Clinton
0450	DONALD TRUMP	So let me explain it.
0451	CHUCK TODD	2012 or now?
0452	DONALD TRUMP	Okay.
0453	DONALD TRUMP	So recently, a magazine said, "Donald Trump's a world class businessman."
0454	DONALD TRUMP	And I am.
0455	DONALD TRUMP	I built an amazing company.
0456	DONALD TRUMP	Some of the greatest assets in the world.
0457	DONALD TRUMP	And just great stuff.
0458	DONALD TRUMP	All over the world, I go all over the world.
0459	DONALD TRUMP	I'm in Europe, I'm in Asia.
0460	DONALD TRUMP	I'm all over the world.
0461	DONALD TRUMP	I'm not looking to get in fights with politicians.
0462	DONALD TRUMP	I'm not looking to get in fights with the Secretary of State, so when I do something in a country, wherever it may be, in Dubai where I'm doing big jobs, and other places, and China where I'm actually getting ready to sign big jobs through my company.
0463	DONALD TRUMP	Let me just tell you something.
0464	DONALD TRUMP	I want to get along with politicians.
0465	DONALD TRUMP	So when somebody says, "What do you think of Hillary Clinton?"
0466	DONALD TRUMP	Number one, I'm not looking at it that closely, because I'm in business.
0467	DONALD TRUMP	But when somebody says, three, four, five years ago, "Let's look at Hillary Clinton.
0468	DONALD TRUMP	What do you think?"
0469	DONALD TRUMP	I say, "She's doing great."
0470	DONALD TRUMP	I say everybody's doing great.
0471	DONALD TRUMP	The fact is she has not done a good job.
0472	DONALD TRUMP	When I look at what happened with Libya.
0473	DONALD TRUMP	When I look at what happened with Benghazi.
0474	DONALD TRUMP	When you look at the migration.
0475	DONALD TRUMP	When you look at all of the things.
0476	DONALD TRUMP	But I'm not looking to criticize.
0477	DONALD TRUMP	You can look at many politicians that haven't done a good job.
0478	DONALD TRUMP	How are they doing?
0479	DONALD TRUMP	They're doing just fine.
0480	DONALD TRUMP	I'm not looking to get into wars with politicians, because I need politicians.
0481	CHUCK TODD	All right, last question.
0482	CHUCK TODD	Why not release the tax returns that aren't involved in the audit?
0483	DONALD TRUMP	Because it's a link.
0484	DONALD TRUMP	I have very big tax returns.
0485	DONALD TRUMP	I'm sure you've seen the picture where the returns are literally from the floor to up to here.
0486	DONALD TRUMP	They're extremely complex.
0487	DONALD TRUMP	I get audited
0488	CHUCK TODD	Do you think you can do it before the election, though?
0489	DONALD TRUMP	I hope so.
0490	DONALD TRUMP	I'd like to.
0491	DONALD TRUMP	I have no problem releasing the tax returns
0492	CHUCK TODD	Do you pledge to do it before the election?
0493	DONALD TRUMP	Excuse me.
0494	DONALD TRUMP	Sure.
0495	DONALD TRUMP	If the auditors finish.
0496	DONALD TRUMP	I'll do it as fast as the auditors finish.
0497	DONALD TRUMP	Remember this, I've already given my financials.
0498	DONALD TRUMP	And my financials show I'm worth more than $10 billion by any stretch of the imagination.
0499	DONALD TRUMP	Has tremendous cash.
0500	DONALD TRUMP	Tremendous cash flow.
0501	DONALD TRUMP	You don't learn much from tax returns.
0502	DONALD TRUMP	But I would love to give the tax returns.
0503	DONALD TRUMP	But I can't do it until I'm finished with the audit.
0504	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump, I've got to leave it there.
0505	CHUCK TODD	The crowd, it's fired up.
0506	CHUCK TODD	We already heard Mike Leach, Steve Emtman.
0507	DONALD TRUMP	It's fired up.
0508	CHUCK TODD	Big Washington State stars up there.
0509	CHUCK TODD	Thank you for coming on, sir.
0510	DONALD TRUMP	That's right.
0511	DONALD TRUMP	They're great people.
0512	DONALD TRUMP	Thank you.
0513	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0514	CHUCK TODD	Within minutes of finishing the interview with me, Donald Trump said something that is going to raise some eyebrows.
0515	CHUCK TODD	This is what he said about women at that rally in Spokane, Washington.
0516	DONALD TRUMP	I mean, all of the men were petrified to speak to women anymore.
0517	DONALD TRUMP	We may raise our voice.
0518	DONALD TRUMP	You know what?
0519	DONALD TRUMP	The women get it better than we do, folks.
0520	CHUCK TODD	We'll discuss that after the break.
0521	CHUCK TODD	And throughout the morning, we want to show you moments from commencement addresses around the country from some key political leaders.
0522	CHUCK TODD	We'll start with President Obama at Howard University.
0523	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0524	PRES. BARACK OBAMA	Given the current state of our political rhetoric and debate let me say something that may be controversial.
0525	PRES. BARACK OBAMA	And that is this, America is a better place today than it was when I graduated from college.
0526	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0527	CHUCK TODD	Welcome back.
0528	CHUCK TODD	Our panel is here.
0529	CHUCK TODD	Matt Bai, national political correspondent and columnist for Yahoo News, Republican strategist and pollster Kellyanne Conway, fresh off of Cruz super PAC world.
0530	CHUCK TODD	Welcome, good to see you here.
0531	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Thank you.
0532	CHUCK TODD	Happy Mother's Day, by the way.
0533	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Thank you very much.
0534	CHUCK TODD	Andrea Mitchell, chief foreign affairs correspondent, and of course, Eugene Robinson, PulitzerPrize winner of The Washington Post.
0535	CHUCK TODD	I teased everybody with that quote that Trump said at this rally, and let me play it again for anybody that forgot about it.
0536	CHUCK TODD	Let's take a listen.
0537	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0538	DONALD TRUMP	I mean, all of the men were petrified to speak to women anymore.
0539	DONALD TRUMP	We may raise our voice.
0540	DONALD TRUMP	You know what?
0541	DONALD TRUMP	The women get it better than we do, folks.
0542	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0543	CHUCK TODD	Kellyanne, thoughts?
0544	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Well, that's his whole riff on political correctness.
0545	KELLYANNE CONWAY	He's not talking about what I think the Hillary people will say he meant, which is pay equity and reproductive rights and healthcare access for women and their children.
0546	KELLYANNE CONWAY	He's talking about political correctness.
0547	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I mean, this is a man who over the course of the year, as the frontrunner, the entire time, and now the presumptive nominee, Chuck, has been able to really cash in with voters on this "us versus them."
0548	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And the "them" changes all the time.
0549	KELLYANNE CONWAY	The "them" is the big system, the "them" is political correctness, the "them" is the people who take money for
0550	CHUCK TODD	There's always a "them."
0551	KELLYANNE CONWAY	There's always a "them."
0552	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And I think this is just part of that.
0553	CHUCK TODD	Andrea?
0554	ANDREA MITCHELL	Well, he's tapping into, as Kellyanne said, the anger.
0555	ANDREA MITCHELL	And talking about a rigged system, he's also embracing Bernie Sanders because he's trying to recruit the antiHillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders supporters, tap into all of that, they're all against us, the establishment, Hillary Clinton is the establishment.
0556	ANDREA MITCHELL	And he doesn't answer questions or he changes his positions at will.
0557	ANDREA MITCHELL	And he still manages to get away with it because he is talking above the level of people questioning him.
0558	CHUCK TODD	But Matt, I was just thinking, imagine if Mitt Romney had said that quote.
0559	MATT BAI	Yeah, yeah.
0560	CHUCK TODD	Four years ago.
0561	MATT BAI	But this is
0562	CHUCK TODD	I mean, he got punished for what Todd Akin said four years ago.
0563	KELLYANNE CONWAY	But "binders of women" wasn't exactly the finest moment.
0564	CHUCK TODD	It wasn't, but this is something you would think would become
0565	MATT BAI	Binders of women wasn't great.
0566	MATT BAI	No, it's the same reason, the reason he can, you know, we call it a flipflop, right, when somebody says one thing and does another.
0567	MATT BAI	Politics, you can't get away with it.
0568	MATT BAI	The voters don't like it, it's a sign of inauthenticity, right?
0569	MATT BAI	Inconsistency.
0570	MATT BAI	One thing we learned in this primary process, and I think we need to heed it very carefully going forward, he is not judged by the standards of a politician.
0571	MATT BAI	He is judged by the standards of an entertainer.
0572	MATT BAI	And entertainers, by the way, reinvent themselves constantly.
0573	MATT BAI	Read any gossip magazine, they're constantly changing who they are, what they say.
0574	MATT BAI	The question that remains over this general election is in a general election, with a different broader electorate, is he judged as a politician, or is he judged the way you'd judge an entertainer?
0575	MATT BAI	Because if it's the latter thats a different thing.
0576	EUGENE ROBINSON	I think that's totally right.
0577	EUGENE ROBINSON	I think that's what we saw throughout that interview.
0578	EUGENE ROBINSON	When you started asking him about his contradictions and about the issues, "What do you think about minimum wage?"
0579	EUGENE ROBINSON	Well, yes and no, right?
0580	EUGENE ROBINSON	I mean, he needs to go either way.
0581	EUGENE ROBINSON	He's going to go both ways.
0582	EUGENE ROBINSON	The same on every issue that you tried to pin him down on.
0583	EUGENE ROBINSON	And so I think it makes the general election campaign totally unpredictable, except in its unpredictability, except in the fact that Trump will run to the left of Clinton on some issues, to the right on other issues.
0584	EUGENE ROBINSON	And that might set
0585	CHUCK TODD	But are conservatives going, "See, we told you he would do this."
0586	CHUCK TODD	He's doing exactly what Ted Cruz said he was going to do.
0587	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Some are, Chuck.
0588	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And they're welcome to their opinions.
0589	KELLYANNE CONWAY	However, you can't leave on the field the tenmillionplus voters who supported this man in the primaries.
0590	KELLYANNE CONWAY	It's a historically high figure.
0591	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And I just have to push back a little bit.
0592	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I don't think it's fair to say he's judged as an entertainer.
0593	KELLYANNE CONWAY	What he's judged as is a nonpolitician.
0594	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And we found out, the super PAC
0595	CHUCK TODD	The hard way.
0596	KELLYANNE CONWAY	that, politicians are held for account now for their positions.
0597	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Nonpoliticians will be held sometime in the future for their positions.
0598	KELLYANNE CONWAY	But look, I'm not sure that the election this fall will be a referendum on Donald Trump.
0599	KELLYANNE CONWAY	It could be a referendum on Hillary Clinton.
0600	KELLYANNE CONWAY	It's going to be easy for him to say, "Look, you've been in public life for 30 years, so if you want to improve the lot of women, where have you been?"
0601	CHUCK TODD	Let's go though to this Ryan riff a little bit.
0602	CHUCK TODD	Donors, it was funny, is it donor generated or was it a message to donors, a message to incumbents who are afraid of running with Trump?
0603	ANDREA MITCHELL	I think what Paul Ryan is saying is that he has to protect the House majority.
0604	ANDREA MITCHELL	He has to protect, you know, incumbent Congress members who are concerned about the Donald Trump effect.
0605	ANDREA MITCHELL	So he's basically going to worry about the swing districts, which is his majority, and those in the safe districts can go with Trump or do whatever they have to do.Look, the fact that he changed his position on minimum wage and on his tax proposal in one interview with you, and has also said importantly, he said in the last 48 hours on CNBC that he would let the U.S. default.
0606	ANDREA MITCHELL	He would let the U.S. become Greece.
0607	ANDREA MITCHELL	When he is saying, "I'm not going to pay 100% on treasury bonds," he is saying something to Republican donors, to the business community, that is so shocking, that if it is widely
0608	MATT BAI	Right, but does that hurt him politically?
0609	ANDREA MITCHELL	Well, it hurts him within
0610	MATT BAI	Does it?
0611	MATT BAI	I mean
0612	KELLYANNE CONWAY	No.
0613	MATT BAI	No.
0614	MATT BAI	I mean, look
0615	ANDREA MITCHELL	I think it does.
0616	MATT BAI	If
0617	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Not now.
0618	ANDREA MITCHELL	If it is properly explained.
0619	EUGENE ROBINSON	I think it hurts him some.
0620	MATT BAI	If I'm Donald Trump, and there are few people I'd less likely be, but if I were Donald Trump, I'd go right into the teeth of that.
0621	MATT BAI	I think it'd be a terrible mistake to try and be the Republican standard bearer.
0622	MATT BAI	He has to run against the entire system and this is an opening for him to do that.
0623	EUGENE ROBINSON	Right, but he walks a line when he says these outrageous things that are crazy, perhaps, that we think are crazy, but somehow he never goes too far for his base.
0624	EUGENE ROBINSON	There are things he could say that would go too far for his base.
0625	CHUCK TODD	Okay.
0626	ANDREA MITCHELL	What?
0627	CHUCK TODD	And you know what?
0628	EUGENE ROBINSON	We don't know yet.
0629	CHUCK TODD	We don't know what they are yet, do we?
0630	EUGENE ROBINSON	We don't know what they are yet.
0631	CHUCK TODD	We always think we did.
0632	EUGENE ROBINSON	I am confident that they're out there.
0633	CHUCK TODD	We're going to talk more about all the "we thinks" and "we thoughts" and what happens later.
0634	CHUCK TODD	When we come back though, how long has it been since a candidate has been this far behind at the start of the general election campaign?
0635	CHUCK TODD	That's where Trump is right now.
0636	CHUCK TODD	So what are the chances that Trump can make up the difference?
0637	CHUCK TODD	We'll show you what history says.
0638	CHUCK TODD	And we continue hearing from commencement speakers from the weekend of the political ilk.
0639	CHUCK TODD	Here's Mitt Romney.
0640	SYSTEM	(BEIN TAPE)
0641	MITT ROMNEY	We live in tumultuous times.
0642	MITT ROMNEY	Demagogues on the right and the left draw upon our darker angels, scapegoating immigrants and Muslims or bankers and businesspeople.
0643	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0644	MITT ROMNEY	  
0645	CHUCK TODD	Welcome back, Data Download time.
0646	CHUCK TODD	You probably know by now that Donald Trump is behind Hillary Clinton in the polls.
0647	CHUCK TODD	But did you know that the last time a candidate was this far behind at this stage has actually been more than a generation ago?
0648	CHUCK TODD	Let's dive in.
0649	CHUCK TODD	In the latest NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll conducted a few weeks ago, we had Donald Trump trailing Hillary Clinton nationally by 11 points, its actually particularly an unprecedented number.
0650	CHUCK TODD	Let me compare.
0651	CHUCK TODD	For instance, when Mitt Romney clinched the Republican nomination in April of 2012, he trailed President Obama at that point in time by six.
0652	CHUCK TODD	He ended up losing by four.
0653	CHUCK TODD	Senator John McCain started only two points behind Senator Obama in March, 2008, when he had become the presumptive nominee.
0654	CHUCK TODD	Of course, McCain lost by seven.
0655	CHUCK TODD	John Kerry was behind incumbent George W. Bush at two points in March of '04, the month he became the presumptive nominee.
0656	CHUCK TODD	By the way, the race essentially stayed in the same place.
0657	CHUCK TODD	Kerry lost by three.
0658	CHUCK TODD	In 2000, it was March when both Gore and Bush became presumptive nominees of their respective parties.
0659	CHUCK TODD	That first matchup had Bush up 4641.
0660	CHUCK TODD	Gore made up the ground on the popular vote, but he lost the electoral college and of course Bush won.
0661	CHUCK TODD	You have to go all the way back to 1996 to find a presumptive nominee in worse shape than Trump is right now.
0662	CHUCK TODD	And that was Bob Dole.
0663	CHUCK TODD	He trailed Bill Clinton by 17 points at the start of the general election campaign in May of '96.
0664	CHUCK TODD	But Dole did make up some ground, but he eventually lost in an electoral landslide by eight points.
0665	CHUCK TODD	So what does this all mean?
0666	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump of course was never an underdog in the G.O.P.
0667	CHUCK TODD	primary.
0668	CHUCK TODD	He led in nearly every poll after he entered the race.
0669	CHUCK TODD	Many folks just simply thought we should ignore the polls, that the polls were wrong, that they were oversampling Trump voters.
0670	CHUCK TODD	The polls were right, Trump won.
0671	CHUCK TODD	But those same polls have all had Trump losing to Clinton and in many cases, losing them badly.
0672	CHUCK TODD	Can Trump make up the ground?
0673	CHUCK TODD	History as we just showed you, says no.
0674	CHUCK TODD	But then again, he's already defied history once.
0675	CHUCK TODD	When we come back, an example of what Donald Trump is up against.
0676	CHUCK TODD	A Republican senator who's not ready to endorse him.
0677	CHUCK TODD	But he's also not ready to reject him outright either.
0678	CHUCK TODD	Welcome back.
0679	CHUCK TODD	As we said earlier, divided parties lose elections.
0680	CHUCK TODD	It's a pretty simple proposition.
0681	CHUCK TODD	Let me show you some history here.
0682	CHUCK TODD	In '68, the Democrats were split.
0683	CHUCK TODD	They had their establishment vice president, Hubert Humphrey.
0684	CHUCK TODD	They had a peacewing candidate led by Eugene McCarthy.
0685	CHUCK TODD	That riff played out on the streets of Chicago and helped Richard Nixon take the White House.
0686	CHUCK TODD	'76, Gerald Ford was challenged on the right all the way to the convention by Ronald Reagan.
0687	CHUCK TODD	A fight, arguably, some could say, to help put Jimmy Carter into the White House that fall.
0688	CHUCK TODD	1980, it was Carter's turn.
0689	CHUCK TODD	A bitter challenge from the left by Senator Ted Kennedy certainly helped Reagan win 44 states and the presidency.
0690	CHUCK TODD	1992, George H. W. Bush was the president, he had a populist primary challenger in the very conservative Pat Buchanan, an insurgency arguably that helped make Bush a oneterm president.
0691	CHUCK TODD	Joining me now is a man who's emblematic of the current split in the Republican party.
0692	CHUCK TODD	He's Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who right now says he's not ready to support Donald Trump, but he also hasn't ruled it out either.
0693	CHUCK TODD	Senator Flake, welcome back to the show, sir.
0694	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	Hey, thanks for having me on.
0695	CHUCK TODD	So you have said he's got to earn your support, you're looking for him to change his tone, change some of it, particularly the issue on the temporary ban on Muslims seems to be among the things that you find most difficult to support because it doesn't pass constitutional muster.
0696	CHUCK TODD	If he doesn't retract that, can you ever support him?
0697	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	You know, I can't see that.
0698	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	He's got to soften his position there.
0699	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	I mean, a total and complete ban on Muslims, that is a religious test that is certainly against the constitution.
0700	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	And it is the last thing we should do if we want to win a war on terrorism.
0701	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	So it's constitutionally wrong and also strategically, it's just not a smart thing to do.
0702	CHUCK TODD	So what should the party do though?
0703	CHUCK TODD	What do you want?
0704	CHUCK TODD	Do you want to see Mitt Romney run?
0705	CHUCK TODD	If Trump's not going to back away from these things, and you can't support him, what do you do?
0706	CHUCK TODD	How do you help your friend John McCain win his reelection in Arizona?
0707	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	You know, obviously Donald Trump was not my first choice or my 17th choice to put it mildly.
0708	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	However, he is the nominee, the presumptive nominee.
0709	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	I don't see a thirdparty challenger come along.
0710	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	I would rather, as Paul Ryan has said, rather Mr. Trump simply change some of his positions and modify what he has said.
0711	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	Now, I think he's going to need to, we are well behind in the polls right now, and in order to win this election, if Republicans want to win, and we do, then we've got to change the approach because we're not going to win taking these positions.
0712	CHUCK TODD	You know, some Trump supporters would say modifying has been the problem with Republican nominees in the past.
0713	CHUCK TODD	Modifying, not saying what you believe, not speaking truth to power, or however you want to characterize what Trump is doing.
0714	CHUCK TODD	And they say, "Hey, the voters have spoken, Senator, you need to get on board with him.
0715	CHUCK TODD	Why should he be obligated to get on board with where the Republican party is?"
0716	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	Republican voters have spoken in a primary.
0717	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	We've found in the past that that's a big difference from voters speaking in a general election.
0718	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	We're now moving to a general election and it's a different ballgame completely.
0719	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	We've found in the past, and we've done an autopsy every time we come out of one of these elections that we, for example, need a better position on immigration.
0720	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	Simply saying we're going to deport 11 million people, that's not a position you can take in a general election.
0721	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	It's not a rational approach.
0722	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	So a general election is far different from a primary election.
0723	CHUCK TODD	Do you accept this idea though that if a significant chunk of party leadership, like yourself, Speaker Ryan, doesn't end up rallying around Trump, it probably is the death warrant for his candidacy in the fall.
0724	CHUCK TODD	Are you comfortable with that?
0725	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	I don't think that that's death warrant for his candidacy.
0726	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	I think supporting a religious test for people to come here, saying you're going to change libel laws to make it easier to sue those who you don't agree with, saying that we're going to default on the debt, taking positions like that are what is going to impede your campaign, not the fact that some Republican leaders disagree with you.
0727	CHUCK TODD	Is there anything from Trump's success that in these primaries that made you think, "You know what, maybe I ought to rethink my position on X"?
0728	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	You know, like I said, it's one thing to win a primary.
0729	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	We all know that it's easier to win a primary taking certain positions, sometimes hardcore positions.
0730	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	But we always know that those positions may not work in a general either.
0731	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	So it's one thing to win a primary, it's a complete other ballgame to win a general election.
0732	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	We're out to win a general election as Republicans.
0733	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	We don't want another eight years or another four years of a Democrat in the White House.
0734	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	And so we've got to take a different position than we've taken in the primary.
0735	CHUCK TODD	You're one of the few Republicans that met with the president Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, you called him a "man of accomplishment," and somebody with a quote, "keen intellect."
0736	CHUCK TODD	But you also believe that you want to wait for the election.
0737	CHUCK TODD	You think the voters should have a say in this before dealing with the Supreme Court vacancy.
0738	CHUCK TODD	Now that Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee, have you changed your mind on that pledge?
0739	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	I think Republicans are more than justified in waiting.
0740	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	That is following both principle and precedent.
0741	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	But the principle is to have the most conservative, qualified jurists that we can have on the Supreme Court, not that the people ought to decide before the next election.
0742	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	I've never held that position.
0743	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	If we come to a point, Ive said all along, where we're going to lose the election, or we lose the election in November, then we ought to approve him quickly.
0744	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	Because I'm certain that he'll be more conservative than a Hillary Clinton nomination comes January.
0745	CHUCK TODD	All right.
0746	CHUCK TODD	Jeff Flake, Republican senator from Arizona, I'm going to leave it there.
0747	CHUCK TODD	Thanks for getting up early out there and coming on this morning.
0748	CHUCK TODD	I appreciate it.
0749	SENATOR JEFF FLAKE	Glad to do it.
0750	CHUCK TODD	Alrighty.
0751	CHUCK TODD	We'll be back in a moment, but first Dana Carvey's church lady made a comeback last night on S.N.L.
0752	CHUCK TODD	Take a look.
0753	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0754	DANA CARVEY	Now we've landed on the exciting presidential matchup between a godless, liberal Democrat and Hillary Clinton.
0755	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0756	CHUCK TODD	We are back.
0757	CHUCK TODD	So, how does the Republican Party put this all back together?
0758	CHUCK TODD	Its just interesting hearing from Jeff Flake, um, Kellyanne.
0759	CHUCK TODD	Uh, I want to put up what Bill Bennett said.
0760	CHUCK TODD	Bill Bennett, you know, you have Jeff Flake, Paul Ryan, theyre in one place.
0761	CHUCK TODD	Bill Bennett said this Its not the time to be out there demanding all of these things, trying to get Trump to suddenly become Reagan.
0762	CHUCK TODD	Now is the time to surround him with good people and work with him at the convention.
0763	CHUCK TODD	You said something interesting during the break, you said this is generational in the conservative movement.
0764	CHUCK TODD	Explain.
0765	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Some of it is, you know how John McCain was saying hell vote for Donald Trump, I mean, he obviously has 
0766	CHUCK TODD	Bob Dole.
0767	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Bob Dole.
0768	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Newt Gingrich.
0769	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Bill Bennett, now.
0770	KELLYANNE CONWAY	It is somewhat generation for them.
0771	KELLYANNE CONWAY	They recognize that its healthy for a party going through some growing pains to actually shed some of its skin.
0772	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I also  I also want to get back to Senator Flakes interview, because I thought it was astonishing for this reason Donald Trump just won 48 percent of the vote in the Republican primary  every single delegate in Flakes home state of Arizona, he got 250,000 voters, and you just cant ignore that.
0773	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I mean his policies on immigration began in Jan Brewers Arizona.
0774	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And so I think there's a zeitgeist out there that some of the establishment of a Republican party are still ignoring.
0775	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And I would say, when I think of Senator Flake, I also, who I respect enormously, I think of this whole class of 2010 that is up for reelection in the Senate in 2016 this year.
0776	KELLYANNE CONWAY	They rode the Tea Party wave.
0777	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And now they've switched to decaf somehow.
0778	KELLYANNE CONWAY	It's like your votes are so moderate, and if you look back
0779	MATT BAI	They got into government.
0780	KELLYANNE CONWAY	They got into government.
0781	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And you go back a year ago, and look at their approval ratings and their reelect numbers a year ago.
0782	KELLYANNE CONWAY	They weren't doing so well.
0783	KELLYANNE CONWAY	So laying it just at the feet of Donald Trump I think is nave and inaccurate.
0784	EUGENE ROBINSON	But to your point about the generational divide, the idea that a bunch of senior figures are going to sit Donald Trump down in a room and coach him up, I mean, this is just insane.
0785	EUGENE ROBINSON	It's not going to happen, right?
0786	EUGENE ROBINSON	And more to that point, Trump knows it's not going to happen.
0787	EUGENE ROBINSON	Trump is behaving as if this is his party now.
0788	EUGENE ROBINSON	And that's what they're up against.
0789	ANDREA MITCHELL	And when Paul Ryan was saying, you know, "I want to hear a different tone," he does not want to hear what Donald Trump then went right out and did, which was to talk about Hillary Clinton, the philandering of Bill Clinton, how she was an enabler, he talked about murderers involved in Whitewater.
0790	ANDREA MITCHELL	In that very next speech, he was going in every direction that Paul Ryan does not want to hear.
0791	ANDREA MITCHELL	He really wants to see whether Donald Trump can speak differently.
0792	ANDREA MITCHELL	And he's not going to speak differently.
0793	ANDREA MITCHELL	He can say one thing when he's on a teleprompter and another when he's out in front of a crowd, which is egging him on and reinforcing his basic instincts.
0794	ANDREA MITCHELL	And Newt Gingrich, you can put Gingrich on the ticket, which is part of what's going on also, you know, put a running mate on who can help work with Congress.
0795	ANDREA MITCHELL	That is not going to change Donald Trump.
0796	KELLYANNE CONWAY	But as a Republican strategist here, I just have to say, Paul Ryan, who I have great affection, admiration for, he was on the ticket last time.
0797	KELLYANNE CONWAY	The RomneyRyan ticket lost eight of the nine swing states, they lost his home state of Wisconsin by almost seven points
0798	ANDREA MITCHELL	I don't think you can blame the running mate for what happened at the top of the ticket.
0799	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Well  but it's fine, it's just that it's like, you had your chance last time.
0800	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I mean, they got 5 percent of the African American vote in Wisconsin.
0801	KELLYANNE CONWAY	They got beaten among Hispanics by two to one.
0802	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Is Trump going to do worse than that?
0803	MATT BAI	Kellyanne makes a really, well, meaning to I think makes a really it was an interesting point here, which is about, you know, for years, for cycles and cycles and cycles, the Republican establishment has basically said to the base of the Republican party, "You lost"
0804	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Fall in line.
0805	MATT BAI	swallow it, get in line.
0806	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And we have.
0807	MATT BAI	Now they're being asked to get in line, and suddenly it's, "But it's not your party."
0808	CHUCK TODD	Wait a minute  you inherited it.
0809	CHUCK TODD	And Trump rightfully said, Inherited it?
0810	CHUCK TODD	I won it."
0811	EUGENE ROBINSON	I won it.
0812	EUGENE ROBINSONI	won it.
0813	EUGENE ROBINSONI	did not inherit the party, I won it.
0814	EUGENE ROBINSON	And he's right.
0815	EUGENE ROBINSON	He beat them.
0816	EUGENE ROBINSON	He beat them badly.
0817	ANDREA MITCHELL	Guys, look at where Hillary Clinton is going to be tomorrow.
0818	ANDREA MITCHELL	She's going to be in LoudounCounty, Virginia.
0819	CHUCK TODD	Actually, today I believe.
0820	CHUCK TODD	I think they're campaigning, I think that starts today.
0821	ANDREA MITCHELL	No that is her tomorrow, Monday afternoon.
0822	ANDREA MITCHELL	Loudoun County, Virginia.
0823	ANDREA MITCHELL	That is where she is going to go for a Republican and swing voters for women, married women, older women, because she has not gotten the millennials, she knows she's got a big problem there.
0824	ANDREA MITCHELL	But that is where she is trying to fight a general election strategy.
0825	CHUCK TODD	Kelly, and I want to let you to have the last
0826	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And the following day shes going to lose in West Virginia and Oregon.
0827	CHUCK TODD	Right.
0828	CHUCK TODD	But I want you to have the last word here on women.
0829	CHUCK TODD	You have spent a lot of time polling women for the Republican party, trying to help them with their problems with the gender gap.
0830	CHUCK TODD	How does Donald Trump fix this gender gap issue?
0831	KELLYANNE CONWAY	He has to go on the issues.
0832	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And so, because so far, I think if Hillary Clinton runs a strict ideological and identitypolitics campaign, she could lose.
0833	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And she also has a problem among men.
0834	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I think part of what Donald Trump says on the stump is very machismo, because Hillary Clinton has the reverse gender gap.
0835	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Men dislike her, don't trust her, and don't want her to be commander in chief
0836	CHUCK TODD	Who's the majority of the country, though.
0837	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Of course they are.
0838	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And he will, I think he has to fight her on the issues.
0839	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Because the one thing that's not going to change between now and November is who is the outsider and who is the insider.
0840	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And this does seem to be an outsider's election.
0841	MATT BAI	Boy, if he has to fight her on the issues, I don't know.
0842	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Well, where has she been for 30 years?
0843	CHUCK TODD	I'm going to do a quick 45second pause and well pick this back up here.
0844	CHUCK TODD	Endgame is coming up.
0845	CHUCK TODD	But first, we're going to continue.
0846	CHUCK TODD	Here's Bill Clinton speaking to a class of 2016 as well.
0847	CHUCK TODD	Take a listen.
0848	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0849	PRES. BILL CLINTON	The last two years has seen an amazing explosion of economic, social, and political empowerment.
0850	PRES. BILL CLINTON	They have also laid bare the power of persistent inequalities, political and social instability, and identity politics based on the simple proposition that our differences are all that matter.
0851	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0852	ANNOUNCER	Coming up, Meet the Press endgame, brought to you by Boeing, building the future one century at a time.
0853	CHUCK TODD	End Game time and I always feel bad when we have a great conversation and then the 45second break and Im like I want to recreate that.
0854	CHUCK TODD	Quickly Bill Clinton you had an interesting reaction you guys just now to his commencement Matt.
0855	MATT BAI	Well you can see that these years have been difficult for him, he is struggling with his legacy of the 90s.
0856	MATT BAI	That he is so proud of which has gotten pilloried now by both parties.
0857	MATT BAI	And I think that he is trying to to make the case, that that progress is real and that the rest of it isn't his fault.
0858	MATT BAI	And I think that he's always haunted by that
0859	KELLYANNE CONWAY	But also, Bill Clinton's Democratic party is gone.
0860	KELLYANNE CONWAY	They've purged their prolifers, they're proSecond Amendment, there are no boll weevil Democrats, no Blue Dog Democrats who are the fiscally conservative.
0861	ANDREA MITCHELL	Or the D.L.C.
0862	ANDREA MITCHELL	that he helped create.
0863	KELLYANNE CONWAY	It's disbanded.
0864	ANDREA MITCHELL	And his own wife has left him on that.
0865	KELLYANNE CONWAY	That's correct.
0866	ANDREA MITCHELL	She has now moved so far towards Bernie Sanders, and she can't move back again.
0867	CHUCK TODD	But i thought it was fascinating, you know, we could have done 20 minutes on what he meant by that.
0868	EUGENE ROBINSON	Well yeah, yeah.
0869	CHUCK TODD	He seems a little fearful of the change.
0870	EUGENE ROBINSON	Well, he's fearful of the change, he doesn't like the fact that identity politics and microtargeting, and all of that
0871	ANDREA MITCHELL	Or that hes being protested against
0872	EUGENE ROBINSON	that's not Bill Clinton.
0873	EUGENE ROBINSON	That's not his style.
0874	CHUCK TODD	All right, let's move to the media.
0875	CHUCK TODD	Jim Rutenberg is the media writer at The New York Times, he wrote this "Every election cycle brings questionable news coverage, but this season has been truly spectacular in its failings.
0876	CHUCK TODD	It has been 'Dewey Defeats Truman' on a relentless, rolling basis.
0877	CHUCK TODD	The mistakes piled up, the bad predictions, the overplaying of every slight development of the horse race to the point of whiplash, the lighthearted treatment of what turned out to be the most serious candidacy in the Republican field.
0878	CHUCK TODD	The lessons learned did not."
0879	CHUCK TODD	I'm sort of amused by this coming from The New York Times.
0880	CHUCK TODD	Eugene, not to pile on one newspaper, but if you were to compare, say, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, the two big behemoths, The Post took Trump more seriously
0881	EUGENE ROBINSON	Uh, yeah,more seriously.
0882	CHUCK TODD	quicker than The Times did.
0883	EUGENE ROBINSON	Right, right.
0884	EUGENE ROBINSON	The key to covering this campaign was to cover the campaign as it was, not as you thought it should be.
0885	CHUCK TODD	Or wished it was.
0886	EUGENE ROBINSON	Or wished it was, or whatever.
0887	EUGENE ROBINSON	And so observer bias crept into a lot of coverage and people took more seriously the data points that confirmed their view than the data points that refuted their view.
0888	EUGENE ROBINSON	And so while Donald Trump was winning, he was way ahead in the polls, and so people would write that well, 56 percent of Republicans voted for somebody other than Donald Trump.
0889	EUGENE ROBINSON	Well, yeah.
0890	EUGENE ROBINSON	But, 85 percent voted for somebody other than Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio or whatever, so.
0891	ANDREA MITCHELL	But i dont thinkI don't think you can escape the fact that he got enormous amounts of free media and that it was all focused on live carrying of his rallies and reporting every tweet.
0892	ANDREA MITCHELL	And there was less policy discussion, less policy coverage, not just about Donald Trump but all of the candidates.
0893	ANDREA MITCHELL	It was more horserace, more poll driven, more socialmedia driven than in any previous campaign
0894	CHUCK TODD	But by the way, the candidates was more poll driven.
0895	CHUCK TODD	Dont forget the candidatesI know
0896	ANDREA MITCHELL	But that doesn't mean that you define it.
0897	CHUCK TODD	I understand that.
0898	CHUCK TODD	But here was another thing I'm wondering, if you're Ted Cruz, or if you're any candidate in the future, message discipline is a negative.
0899	KELLYANNE CONWAY	It's actually a negative.
0900	MATT BAI	It has been for awhile.
0901	KELLYANNE CONWAY	That's right.
0902	CHUCK TODD	By the way, apparently because it's boring?
0903	KELLYANNE CONWAY	It's boring.
0904	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And it's also, look, it's not just the coverage.
0905	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I think there was, to Gene's point, conclusions in search of evidence
0906	EUGENE ROBINSON	Yes, yes.
0907	KELLYANNE CONWAY	the entire time this race was covered.
0908	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And I think it's been very humbling for some folks.
0909	KELLYANNE CONWAY	But its also, I don't think Donald Trump could have run as effectively four or eight years ago.
0910	KELLYANNE CONWAY	He's got this multilevel media platform now.
0911	KELLYANNE CONWAY	If he's not tweeting, he's rallying.
0912	KELLYANNE CONWAY	If he's not rallying, he's giving interviews to folks like you, Chuck.
0913	KELLYANNE CONWAY	But I also want to say something else that's not been said.
0914	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I think it's also, he's just much more fun to cover than Hillary Clinton.
0915	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And that's going to matter this fall too.
0916	ANDREA MITCHELL	Well, he was much more excessive.
0917	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Correct.
0918	MATT BAI	I think there's a little bit of a false dichotomy here.
0919	MATT BAI	I agree with Andrea and I've written a lot about the role that the media played, particularly in the early phase of this campaign.
0920	MATT BAI	But it was a little bit about, I think Jim, who's a fantastic writer and a friend of mine, sets up a little bit of a false dichotomy by saying, you know, "He was treated too much as an entertainer and not taken seriously as a politician."
0921	MATT BAI	I think the real mistake is the media not understanding that there is no line between politics and entertainment in this environment.
0922	CHUCK TODD	Well, what a segue.
0923	MATT BAI	And that's where we've ended up.
0924	CHUCK TODD	Because speaking of no line in politics and entertainment, here's S.N.L.
0925	CHUCK TODD	last night.
0926	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0927	DANA CARVEY	Donnie, there are those who say you're not qualified, and that's not true.
0928	DANA CARVEY	You know, I remember a Celebrity Apprentice episode where Gary Busey didn't sell enough pancakes.
0929	DANA CARVEY	And you just said, "You're fired."
0930	DANA CARVEY	And I thought right then and there, "Give this man the nuclear codes."
0931	DARRELL HAMMOND (AS DONALD TRUMP)	A lot of people are saying that.
0932	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0933	ANDREA MITCHELL	I mean, it is the culture that has changed the political coverage as well.
0934	MATT BAI	And the technology.
0935	ANDREA MITCHELL	Yes.
0936	ANDREA MITCHELL	Exactly
0937	CHUCK TODD	Trump has seen it.
0938	EUGENE ROBINSON	Yeah.
0939	CHUCK TODD	Obama was the guy that saw it in '08.
0940	CHUCK TODD	Trump saw it now.
0941	ANDREA MITCHELL	And the Clinton people think that Obama is going to be this political nuclear weapon to go out on a trail,
0942	CHUCK TODD	Could be.
0943	ANDREA MITCHELL	and could be to rally his coalition behind her even though people in his coalition are still lukewarm about her.
0944	ANDREA MITCHELL	But boy, that's a line
0945	MATT BAI	There's a history, theres a history
0946	CHUCK TODD	You guys can keep talking, but I'm going to turn the cameras off.
0947	CHUCK TODD	You guys have been terrific.
0948	CHUCK TODD	That's all for today.
0949	CHUCK TODD	Happy Mother's Day.
0950	CHUCK TODD	CVS is still open if you've forgotten.
0951	CHUCK TODD	So hurry up.
0952	CHUCK TODD	If it's Sunday though, it's Meet the Press.
