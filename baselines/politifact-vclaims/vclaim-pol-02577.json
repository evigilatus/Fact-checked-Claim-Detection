Donald Trump mischaracterizes diversity visa lottery", "text": "President Donald Trump's claims about bad people coming into the United States have expanded to include not just people who get here illegally, but also immigrants who arrive legally after being vetted by the U.S. government.\nTrump told graduates at the FBI National Academy that two recent terrorist attacks in New York City were perpetrated by individuals who came to the United States via a \"dysfunctional immigration system,\" one through family sponsorship and the other through the diversity visa lottery program.\nTrump said: \"They have a lottery. You pick people. Do you think the country is giving us their best people? No. What kind of a system is that? They come in by lottery. They give us their worst people, they put them in a bin, but in his hand, when he\u2019s picking them is, really, the worst of the worst. Congratulations, you\u2019re going to the United States. Okay. What a system \u2014 lottery system.\"\nTrump made similar comments on Dec. 20 at a Cabinet meeting: \"When we take people in a lottery, they're not putting their best people in the lottery. It's common sense. They're not saying, 'Oh, let's take our best people and let's put them into the lottery so that we can send them over to the United States.' No. They put their worst people into the lottery. And that's what we get in many cases.\"\nTrump\u2019s recent comments parallel his Pants on Fire claim as presidential candidate that the Mexican government sends \"the bad ones\" over to the United States.\nIn this case, Trump oversimplified and misconstrued the program. Countries don't send their people. Lottery applicants must meet minimum standards for education or work experience. The lottery is run by the United States, not foreign countries. Lottery winners are selected by a random, computerized process. Individuals must pass background vetting by the U.S. government before getting a visa.\nThe White House declined to comment on the record for this fact-check.\nTrump\u2019s criticism of the diversity visa lottery\nTrump favors a merit-based immigration system where people come in based on job skills, not just because of family connections or for diversity purposes.\nHe\u2019s said the visa lottery \"presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security\" and has pointed as an example Sayfullo Saipov, from Uzbekistan, who entered the United States in 2010 through the lottery program. Saipov is accused of killing eight people and injuring a dozen other in an October vehicular attack in New York City. He\u2019s pleaded not guilty to murder and terrorism charges.\nThe visa lottery program was established in 1990 to diversify the United States\u2019 immigrant population. The lottery began in 1995 and selects applicants from countries with low immigration levels during the previous five years. Diversity visas are currently capped at 50,000 per fiscal year.\nIt's not foreign governments who run\u00a0the lottery, it's administered by the U.S.\u00a0State Department. Here\u2019s its current description of the program:\n\u2022 Applicants register online for the lottery in the fall;\n\u2022 Names of lottery winners are randomly selected by a computer;\n\u2022 Lottery winners are notified around May that they can apply for the diversity visa;\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 The visa application process and interviews begin Oct. 1. This step includes extensive vetting such as biographic and biometric\u00a0screening against U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorism databases;\n\u2022 Applicants who pass the vetting process are awarded the diversity visa, which is usually valid for up to six months from date of issuance.\n\"No visa can be issued unless all concerns raised by the screening are fully resolved. As part of this screening process, information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate U.S. government agencies,\" the State Department said in a statement to PolitiFact.\n\"National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications,\" the agency added.\nThe \u2018worst of the worst\u2019?\nTrump\u2019s comment that the worst are coming not only ignores vetting done by the State Department, but also lottery entry\u00a0requirements of at least a high school education or its equivalent,\u00a0or two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform.\n\"In countries where only a fraction of people complete secondary school, this basic criterion limits the pool of people eligible for the diversity lottery significantly,\" said Beth Elise Whitaker, an associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\nTrump said countries are not \"giving us\" their best people. But that's a flawed statement.\nCountries do not \"give\" immigrants, noted Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University.\n\"Individuals make decisions to apply for any visa, including but not limited to the diversity lottery visa. The decision is a difficult one, as is the process of receiving the visa,\" Cohen said. \"The application and vetting process are also complicated, suggesting that only highly capable and well-prepared individuals will succeed.\"\nCohen said Trump and his administration have promoted two conflicting goals: They have attacked family reunification immigration policies, but also the diversity lottery, \"which does not rely on family reunification and is far more skills-based than the name suggests.\"\n\"The diversity visa program is a true lottery. There is no way a foreign government can game the lottery to offload the worst of their citizenry,\" Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School wrote in an op-ed for the New York Daily News.\nOur ruling\nTrump said of the diversity visa lottery program, \"they give us their worst people, they put them in a bin,\" and \"the worst of the worst\" are selected.\u00a0\nTrump based his criticism of the lottery program on the fact that the suspect in a New York City terror attack came through the program in 2010.\nBut Trump\u2019s simplistic characterization gives a misleading impression of how the process actually works. First of all, countries don't\u00a0\"give us\" immigrants. The lottery is administered by the United States, not foreign governments.\nLottery entrants\u00a0must meet educational and work experience requirements, and\u00a0winners are chosen at random by a computer. Also, winning the lottery does not necessarily mean the person will come to the United States. They must be thoroughly vetted before being awarded a visa.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2017-12-20 20:50:49 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says of the diversity visa lottery program, \"they give us their worst people, they put them in a bin,\" and \"the worst of the worst\" are selected.
