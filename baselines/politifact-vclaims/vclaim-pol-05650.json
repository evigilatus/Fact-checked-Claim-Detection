But lax firearms laws, Clinton said on ABC\u2019s This Week, allow people on the no-fly list to purchase guns, just as they enabled Dylann Roof, accused of killing nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church attack in June.\n\"(Roof) should have never have been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough,\" Clinton said Dec. 6. \"We should be able to approach both of these with some sense of, you know, unity about how we prevent terrorist attacks and how we prevent the wrong people from getting ahold of guns.\"\nIs Clinton right that this system didn\u2019t catch the Charleston shooter in time? She omits some important details in her description, but it largely checks out.\nHow Roof obtained a gun\nUnder current federal law, the FBI performs background checks on would-be gun buyers in South Carolina and 29 other states through its National Instant Criminal Background Check System (the rest of the states do their own background checks). If the check isn\u2019t denied or completed in three days, the gun seller can proceed with the sale.\nWhat happened in Roof\u2019s case comes down to clerical errors.\nHere\u2019s how FBI Director James Comey explained why Roof\u2019s background check wasn\u2019t finished in time to prevent his purchase of a .45-caliber Glock pistol.\nRoof tried to buy a handgun in West Columbia, S.C., a suburb of Columbia, on April 11. A West Virginia-based FBI examiner began vetting him the next business day, April 13, and found that Roof had been arrested for a felony drug charge March 1 (the charge was later corrected as a misdemeanor). Because the records didn\u2019t show a conviction, the examiner couldn\u2019t deny the purchase but continued to look into Roof\u2019s criminal history.\nRoof\u2019s rap sheet mistakenly listed the neighboring county\u2019s sheriff office as the agency that arrested him, leading the FBI examiner to request more information on Roof from the wrong county sheriff\u2019s and prosecutor\u2019s offices. The examiner then contacted the West Columbia police, who replied they had no records of Roof\u2019s arrest. Had the database listed the correct police station (Columbia) or included the report in which Roof admitted to possessing drugs, things would have turned out different, according to Comey.\n\"If a NICS examiner saw that, Roof would be denied permission to buy a gun. But the examiner never saw that,\" he said.\nWhen the three days were up on April 16, the case was still listed as \"pending\" and Roof was able to purchase the gun. Two months later, on June 17, Roof allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and injured one in a historically black church in Charleston.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClerical error or \u2018Charleston loophole\u2019\nBoth sides of the gun debate came to very different conclusions about this news. Clinton and some advocates for tighter gun laws argued Roof was abetted by the three-day time limit for background checks, dubbing it the \"Charleston loophole.\" Supporters of gun rights say the onus is actually on the FBI and its botched paperwork.\nDaniel Webster, the director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University, agrees with Clinton that the FBI would have been able to catch Roof\u2019s conviction if it had more than three days to track down the details.\n\"The follow-up investigation found that the FBI analyst doing the check was still in the process of tracking down the information on the case and hadn\u2019t given up because of the clerical error,\" Webster said.\nCNN reported that FBI examiners officially denied Roof\u2019s gun purchase application a week after the shooting, when he was already in custody.\nUsually when the FBI denies a gun purchase after the fact, the agency notifies the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which then retrieves the firearm.\nIn 2014, the FBI denied approximately 1.1 percent, or 91,000, of would-be gun purchases within three days. Of the transactions that required more than three days to vet, the FBI referred 2,511 for retrieval.\nBack in 2000, the Government Accountability Office reported it took an average of 25 business days for the FBI to determine whether a gun purchase should have been denied. We could not find more recent data.\nOur ruling\nClinton said the Charleston shooter \"should have never have been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough.\"\nDylann Roof admitted to a drug offense a few weeks before he tried to buy a gun, so the FBI said he should have been denied one.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t the three-day time limit by itself that undermined Roof\u2019s background check. There were clerical errors in the FBI\u2019s database that prevented the examiner from seeing Roof\u2019s drug admission.\nClinton\u2019s characterization misses some important information about Roof\u2019s case. We rate it Mostly True.\nNote to readers: A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly said Roof \"admitted to a felony drug offense\" before attempting to buy a gun. That is not what the FBI news release\u00a0said. The release said that a police report about his arrest included Roof's\u00a0admission to possessing illegal drugs, which Comey said would have been enough to deny the sale of the handgun. The story has been updated to reflect that point.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05650"}
