Machado emerged as an issue in the campaign during the first debate, when Hillary Clinton cited Machado's allegations that Trump called the Venezuelan born contestant \"Miss Peggy\" and \"home management\" after gaining weight as the beauty queen of the universe. At that time, Trump was part of the owner of the competition. The following morning, Trump Machado was criticized during an interview with Fox and Friends. Trump eventually brought hostility to Twitter. In the second discussion in October 9, Cooper quoted the tweet in the question whether Trump had the right mood to be president. \"In the days following the first discussion, I sent a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check a sex tape,\" said Cooper. \"Is this the discipline of a good boss?\" Trump replied: \"No, he wasn't saying: \" Look at a sex tape, but it was just \"Look at the person I built to be this wonderful Girl Scout, who wasn't a Girl Scout.'\" This was probably what Trump wanted people to read. But he actually confronted his followers to check out a sex tape. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman (January 11, 2012) in tweeting, it was sent at 5:30 a.m. On September 30, ET -- Tramp wrote, \"Did the disgusting Croak Hillary (verification of sex tape and past) help Alicia become an American citizen so she can use it in the debate?\" (For the record, no one showed up on a sex tape.) The Governor Trump said we had the tweet he sent \"He wasn't saying, \"Check a sex tape,\" but instead \"Just take a look at\" Machado's background. This is ridiculous. While Trump urged his followers on Twitter to check the past \"Machado,\" he literally wrote \"Check the Sex Tape\" in tweeting. We're assessing his license pants on fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c43aya6-512d-4b14-a42a-80b0955e4504", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04168"}
