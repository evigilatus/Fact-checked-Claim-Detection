President Donald Trump's administration announced in May that assistance was on its way to some in the form of a $16 billion agricultural aid package. In particular, farmers suffered from reprisals tariffs in the midst of a continuing trade war with China. Trump imposed additional import taxes on Chinese goods in 2018, and then raised several tariffs again - from 10 per cent to 25 per cent - in May 2019 after the collapse of trade talks. Another round of tariffs was unexpectedly announced, August 1, 2019. Along the way, China has also responded by lifting tariffs. But it was the President &apos; s repeated description of the financing of this rescue operation that drew our attention. \"We are doing well with farmers now in many ways. One way is that we give $16 billion of all the tariffs we collect, \"Tell Trump Charles Benson of WTMJ-TV on July 12, 2019, an interview in Wisconsin. \"Sixteen billion dollars comes all from the tariffs we received from China.\" Trump also referred to tariff payments \"from China\" when he announced the agricultural aid scheme in May and many times since then, including a press conference on July 30, 2019 where he referred to \"taking billions and billions of dollars from China in tariff form.\" Is this how tariffs work? 101 The short answer is no. The following is a description of the joint Centre for Tax Policy of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, an independent group following the effects of tax legislation. Tariff is a tax on imported goods. In spite of what the President says, the importer (usually a local company) pays it directly in almost all cases, and never by the exporting country. Therefore, if the United States imposes a tariff on Chinese television, the charges are paid to the United States Customs and Border Protection Service at the border by an American broker representing, for example, an American importer, Costco. The Chinese Government pays nothing, just as the United States Government pays no tax to Canada for tariffs imposed by that country on imported dairy products. Instead, an importer or supplier of a Canadian business pays fees on Wisconsin cheese that lands at the dairy counter on the stock market. That explanation, which was written in September 2018, pointed out that Trump had \"a quick lack of understanding of how taxes work.\" In May, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that this was what had already happened, saying that the tariffs imposed on China \"were almost entirely borne by the United States. Importers.\" Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, these companies often transfer costs to consumers. The Federal Reserve Bank in New York estimated in May that the tariff round then imposed on United States imports from China would cost the regular household $831 per year. Therefore, China does not pay tariffs. Then who pays for agricultural aid? The Department of Agriculture announced the details of the rescue 25 July 2019, saying the first of three payments is likely to be made by August. The cash per province is disbursed at the rate of one acre based on the \"effect of unjustified commercial retaliation in that province,\" ranging from $15 to $150 per acre. Farmers who grow any of the 27 non-specialized crops (including soybeans, maize, alpha straw, barley and wheat), as well as dairy and pig farmers and producers of some of the plants that produce fruit and nuts, are provided with aid. The aid per farmer amounts to a maximum of $500,000. In addition to China, farmers can access finance if they are affected by American trade disputes with the European Union and Turkey. This programme was modelled on a programme that was implemented last year and distributed some $12 billion in aid to farmers. According to Associated Press, the recent aid package includes $14.5 billion in direct aid in the above categories and $1.4 billion for the purchase and distribution of surplus food from farmers to schools and food banks. Sixteen billion dollars are paid through the Commodity Credit Corporation, a government institution supervised by the United States Department of Agriculture, which can borrow up to $30 billion annually from the United States Treasury and distribute it to farmers specifically without the approval of the United States Congress. Minister of Agriculture Sony Birdo told AP that China was \"indirect\" paying aid, but admitted that tariffs were sent to the Treasury without being allocated for any specific purpose. The Governor Trump said we have $16 billion in agricultural aid funded \"from the tariffs we got from China.\" Tariffs are paid to the United States Treasury, and agricultural aid is financed by the Treasury. However, there is no specific mark or channel linking the two. More importantly, Trump's claim simply does not reflect how tariffs operate. The tariffs imposed by Trump are almost entirely paid by American importers, who transfer much of this to consumers through price increases. We appreciate Trump's claim that it was wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00373"}
