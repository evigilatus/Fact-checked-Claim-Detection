So, most convention speeches were made from a variety of remote locations across the United States.\u00a0\nWe watched the DNC each night (the RNC, too), and each night this is what we heard: \"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\"\nSo, what gives?\nIs the state GOP right about Democrats omitting \"under God\" at its event?\nMeetings upon meetings\nWhen asked to back up the claim, state GOP spokesman Alec Zimmerman pointed PolitiFact to footage of the Aug. 18, 2020 LGBTQ Caucus meeting from the virtually virtual DNC.\u00a0\nIn addition to the main sessions each night, political conventions include a host of additional meetings -- from state delegations, to caucuses focused on specific topics. There were at least 30 of these during the DNC. In an email, Zimmerman wrote of the LGBTQ Caucus meeting:\n\"The person reciting the pledge takes an extra long pause during the spot where \u2018under God\u2019 is normally mentioned, as to acknowledge what she\u2019s doing. All of this was done under the banner of the DNC during the Democrat convention, as is made clear by the header atop the video.\"\nThe video, which is posted on YouTube, shows a person introduced as \"Dr. Richmond\" reciting the pledge. Richmond pauses with a head nod at the point in the pledge where \"under God\" is usually said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Even President Donald Trump tweeted about it on Aug. 22, 2020.\u00a0\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact National examined a similar claim from former Republican U.S. Senate candidate Peggy Hubbard of Illinois, who claimed in an Aug. 20, 2020 Facebook post:\u00a0 \"The DNC omitted \u2018one nation under God\u2019 from the Pledge of Allegiance.\"\u00a0\nAs noted by PolitiFact National:\nSome Democratic caucus members omitted \"one nation under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance during DNC meetings. But the line was not excluded from any of the convention\u2019s primetime televised spots. On each night of the DNC, \"under God\" was included in the Pledge of Allegiance.\nHubbard\u2019s claim was rated Mostly False.\nPhilip Shulman, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, criticized Republicans for highlighting the issue, saying: \"Donald Trump and Wisconsin Republicans know they can\u2019t run on the issues, so instead they are desperately lying to Wisconsinites.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Wisconsin Republican Party in a mailer sent to voters said \"the Pledge of Allegiance was read with the words 'under God' removed\" at the Democratic National Convention.\u00a0\nThere is some truth here, in that this happened at two of the 30 or so caucus and council meetings. But that\u2019s not the impression left by the GOP mailer. Videos from the convention show that \"under God\" was included on all four nights of the main event, which were livestreamed and carried by many TV stations.\nFor a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19029"}
