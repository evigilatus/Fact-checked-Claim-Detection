Hundred of rare koalas are also reported dead among them. Lets pray for Australia Source: University of sydney report #wildfire.\" The Facebook page also has as its cover image a separate photo that shows a kangaroo rushing past a burning house on Dec. 31; that picture was legitimately captured in New South Wales, Australia, by photojournalist Matthew Abbott.\nThe University of Sydney estimated Jan. 3 that 480 million animals have been\u00a0killed in the New South Wales bushfires since September 2019.\nThe tiger image, however, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

(Several commenters on the multi-photo post also said that some of the other images are from other fires, as well).\nTrading in or being in possession of protected animals or their body parts is a criminal offense in Indonesia, and animal traffickers can face up to five years in jail and fines up to $10,000 USD.\nJakarta officials seized 258 animal remains in the 2012 raid, according to an article by the Daily Mail, which included 15 tigers, 2 sun bears and 48 deer, before destroying them. The animals had all been killed by poachers before being stuffed and sold to be displayed in peoples homes.\nAustralia\u2019s fire season is shaping up to be one of the deadliest for the country\u2019s wildlife, but this image is unrelated.
