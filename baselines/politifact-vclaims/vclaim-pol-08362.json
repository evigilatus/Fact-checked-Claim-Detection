Mark Warner.\nThe Virginia Democrat made the claim last month during an interview on a radio show hosted by one of his colleagues, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. Warner was stressing his trademark theme: that Congress needs to take a more organized and long-range approach to budgeting instead of going from crisis to crisis.\n\"I think if folks across America understood how crazy what we were doing in that the largest enterprise in the world is the federal government of the United States of America,\" he said. \"The single largest subset of that is the Defense Department. When you run that large an enterprise on three- and six-month short-term funding resolutions, you actually cost the taxpayer more money that you save because you stop and start contracts, you\u2019re not able to hire people for a long period of time...The amount kind of lost to the taxpayer as well as what it does to our military preparedness, for example, staying on defense, is a huge, huge issue.\"\nWe wondered if the U.S. government really is the biggest show on earth.\nWarner spokesman Kevin Hall sent us links to the president\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2014, which ends in September, and to news articles listing the revenue and employee figures for large corporations.\nLet\u2019s look at employees first. According to White House figures, Uncle Sam employed the equivalent of about 4.3 million full-time workers during the 2013 budget year, which ended Sept. 30. Of them, about 1.5 million are in the military and another 800,000 are civilian workers at the Department of Defense.\nFor comparison, Warner\u2019s office sent us a list of largest worldwide employers published in 2012 by the BBC. We searched on our own for a more current list, but couldn\u2019t find one. Here are the largest employers, behind the U.S. government:\n\nChina\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, 2.3 million workers\nWalmart, 2.1 million\nMcDonald\u2019s, 1.9 million\nUK National Health Service, 1.7 million\nChina National Petroleum Corporation, 1.6 million\nState Grid Corporation of China, 1.5 million\nIndian Railways, 1.4 million\nIndian Armed Forces, 1.3 million.\n\nThere\u2019s a problem with these figures, however. They don\u2019t offer-to-apples comparison of central government employment in the United States to that in China, the world\u2019s most populous country.\nAlthough the data give us an idea of the size of China\u2019s military and its two largest state-owned companies, experts say there is no reliable data on how many people are employed in all sectors of the Chinese government.\nTwo years ago, Liu Xirong, a member of the National People\u2019s Congress in China, cited what he said were official figures showing his nation\u2019s bureaucracy had grown from 6 million public servants in 2006 to 10 million in 2010, according to an article in News China. In response, the State Administration of Civil Service said China\u2019s number of public servants stood at 6.89 million in 2010.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese figures did not include state-owned enterprises and organizations, which would grow the number to more than 30 million, News China reported.\nBarry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies China\u2019s economy, said it\u2019s reasonable to include the employees of state-run corporations in the count. But even if you don\u2019t, logic says China\u2019s rolls of government workers would be longer than the United States\u2019 roster of 4.3 million employees.\n\"In the U.S., labor is expensive and we have substituted technology as shown by the large decline in clerical workers,\" he said. \"In China, technology is expensive and workers are cheap. I do not know of any fully comparable data. I would be quite confident that on most comparisons, China's workforce would be larger, if for no other reason than the size of its army and security forces.\"\nIn addition to number of employees, Warner\u2019s office also told us it defines \"largest enterprise\" by the money an organization takes in and spends. We were pointed to the latest information in the CIA\u2019s World Factbook. It shows the U.S. in 2012 -- with $2.5 trillion in revenues and $3.5 trillion in expenses -- topped all nations in both categories. China, by comparison, collected $1.9 trillion in and spent $2 trillion. Those figures don\u2019t include revenues for China\u2019s state-run corporations which, if added up, would easily exceed the U.S. government\u2019s cash flow.\nThe United States\u2019 budget figures dwarf the finances of the largest corporations in the world.\nAccording to CNNMoney\u2019s list, \u00a0Royal Dutch Shell had the largest revenues last year -- $482 billion. It was followed by WalMart, $469 billion; Exxon Mobil, $450 billion; Sinopec Group, $428 billion; and China National Petroleum, $409 billion.\nOur ruling\nWarner said the U.S government is the largest enterprise in the world. His staff said the statement was based on the federal government\u2019s employment and budget.\nThe claim runs aground in China. Warner\u2019s office cites statistics that compare the employment of the U.S. government to parts of the Chinese government, but not the whole. China has issued conflicting numbers on its total number of civil servants, but they all greatly exceed the number of workers paid by the U.S. government.\nWarner is on better footing on the budgeting side of his claim. A variety of widely used statistics shows no government or corporation raises and spends more money than the U.S.\nSo Warner is wrong on one of measurements and right on the other. We\u2019ll split the difference and rate his statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08362"}
