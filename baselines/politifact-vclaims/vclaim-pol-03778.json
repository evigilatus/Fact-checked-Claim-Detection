Jerry Brown is pushing back with claims the federal health care law has boosted health coverage in the state.\nBrown said California\u2019s uninsured rate is at \"a historic low.\"\n\"The uninsured rate in California has gone down from 17.2 percent in 2013 to a historic low of 7.4 percent in 2016.\"\nBrown made this and other statements about the law\u2019s effect on California in a letter to GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield on Jan. 13, 2017. McCarthy had asked Brown for recommendations on changing the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe wanted to know whether Brown\u2019s claim about \"a historic low\" was accurate. We set out on a fact check.\nOur research\nGov. Brown\u2019s office cited data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that confirm the uninsured rates cited for 2013 and 2016.\nThe 7.4 percent uninsured rate was reported in a survey covering January through June of 2016 by the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. It represents the rate for all ages in California. The same survey cites an 8.4 percent uninsured rate for Californians under 65 years of age.\nThe \u2018all ages\u2019 uninsured rate is slightly lower because it includes the 65 and older population, the vast majority of which has health insurance through Medicare.\nThe governor\u2019s office also cited several sources as evidence that California\u2019s uninsured rate has reached \"a historic low.\"\nThose include a health care almanac maintained by the California Health Care Foundation. It shows the state\u2019s uninsured rate from 1987 to 2015 for Californians under 65, though not the rate for all ages. In 1987, it was 17.6 percent.\n\nCalifornia's uninsured rate hovered near 20 percent during the 1990s and 2000s before declining sharply in recent years as the Affordable Care Act took effect.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe foundation described the state\u2019s 2015 uninsured rate of 8.5 percent for Californians under 65 as \"a historic low.\"\nDeborah Kelch, executive director of the Sacramento-based Insure the Uninsured Project, noted there are many different ways to measure California\u2019s uninsured rate.\nBut no matter which source is examined, she said, \"I think it\u2019s fair to say we have reached a historic low of the uninsured.\"\nIn an interview, Shana Charles, faculty associate at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, also described current uninsured rates as \"historic lows.\"\nCharles said there wasn\u2019t much tracking of the state\u2019s uninsured rate before the 1990s, adding coverage \"certainly wasn\u2019t better\" in past decades.\nShe said there\u2019s been \"a slow expansion\" of health coverage over time in California and across the country since Medicare and Medicaid were enacted in the 1960s.\nOur ruling\nGov. Jerry Brown claimed California\u2019s uninsured rate in 2016 was \"a historic low\" at 7.4 percent.\nAs evidence, his office pointed to the 7.4 percent uninsured rate reported in a survey covering the first half of 2016 by the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. That rate is for all ages in California.\nWhen discussing this topic, many researchers cite the uninsured rate for Californians under 65, which was slightly higher at 8.4 percent. Even at that rate, it would be an historic low.\nData for that rate is more widely available. A health care almanac shows the state\u2019s uninsured rate for Californians under 65 hovered near 20 percent during the 1990s and 2000s before dropping sharply in recent years. Its records go back to 1987 when that rate was 17.6 percent.\nResearchers who study California\u2019s uninsured rate say this measurement was not closely tracked before the 1980s, but said the rate was certainly not lower in past decades. No matter how you measure it, they added, the uninsured rate in California has reached an historic low.\nWe rate Brown's claim True.\n\nTRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2a1bc486-46f5-4b80-9a23-78257f4bb0ad", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03778"}
