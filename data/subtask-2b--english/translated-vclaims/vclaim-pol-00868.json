There's no data to say that.", "text": "In a swinging campaign across the state of Iowa, Corey Booker told the people he met there \"they have the right to be angry\" about what they see happening in their country. \"Aggravats on public education, attacks on work,\" said Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey and a Democratic Presidential candidate, in an 18 March interview with MSNBC. \"It relates to farmers. Farmers' suicide rates are as high as they have been since the Great Depression.\" That poker's allegation of farmers' suicide is not accurate, as we found in our review. There are no known figures on farmers &apos; suicides dating back to the 1930s, none of which were provided by poker staff. \"Information I can find suggests that suicide rates have generally increased during that time,\" said Laurent Stallones, a professor of epidemiology and psychology at Colorado State University. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considered 17 states and compared suicides for key occupational groups in 2012 and 2015. In 2012, the suicide rate for farmers was 44.9 per 100,000 people. In 2015, it stood at 32.2 per 100,000 persons. (The CDC has already reported significantly higher rates, resulting in a lot of news and legislative action. But in the end, these numbers did not exist, and the CDC retracted its report.) Does that mean that the rate dropped between those years? Technically, yes, but beware: The total number of suicides was low, 59 in the first year and 54 in the other year. In these small numbers, few incidents can significantly change rates. Washington defines farmers as people who play a role in running a farm. This is in contrast to agricultural workers, i.e. workers who grow, grow weed and pick up crops. For this group, the CDC found rates of 20.4 and 17.3 per 100,000 in the two years. This does not support Booker &apos; s claim, but the study covered only 17 states. It did not include major agricultural states such as Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and California. On January 31, 2021, Ryan Fornier stated on Twitter, \"Biden's administration has lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\" Noah Y. Kim wrote: 1 February 2021, another factor that makes data less than perfect. Brandy Jansen, Director of the Centre for Safety and Agricultural Health at Iowa University, warned that part-time farmers were often excluded from farmers &apos; statistics, and that their deaths were not recorded. \"I think it's fair to say that we know with some confidence that the suicide rates among farmers are higher than the general population, and that they probably didn't report them sufficiently,\" said Jansen. According to the CDC figures for 2015, the rate for farmers was 32.2, more than double the rate for the general population as a whole, or 13.3. (The overall rate rose in 2017 to 14). For the context, people working in the construction and extraction industry, including roof workers and oil and electric drill operators, have recorded the highest suicide rate - 53.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, or more than three times the national average. The only other researchers who noticed the data point were from the early 1980s, when family farms collapsed at a fierce rate. The National Centre for Agricultural Medicine in Wisconsin has collected suicide reports from Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana. It found that these rates peaked in 1982, reaching 58 deaths per 100,000 between farmers and farm owners. Given the small number of States, this figure is not directly comparable to recent data. However, that undermines the poker statement. Farmer advocates note growing economic pressures. Farm revenues are expected to decline in 2018. Bankruptcy is rising in some states, although we found that at the national level, it's fixed. Agricultural aid group said 30% of calls to their hotlines \"farmers under unbelievable financial, legal and emotional pressure\" However, Stallones has said many forces to shape suicide trends. \"Economic difficulties can contribute to an increase in suicide,\" she said. \"My own research suggests that pesticide poisoning may contribute to mood disorders, which can then lead to (the highest) suicide risk.\" The governor's poker said, \"The farmers' suicide rates are as high as they have been since the Great Depression.\" In general, data on farmers &apos; suicide are not exhaustive, but what exists does not support that statement. Limited data from the 1930s indicate that the overall suicide rate was slightly lower at the time, but we did not find any specific figures for farmers. The latest government report on farmers &apos; suicides provides a narrow comparison between 2012 and 2015. The rate was higher in 2012, but the number of suicides in both years was too small to draw conclusive conclusions. In a group of Upper Midwest states, the rate was significantly higher in 1982 than the rates reported today. We value this allegation wrong.
