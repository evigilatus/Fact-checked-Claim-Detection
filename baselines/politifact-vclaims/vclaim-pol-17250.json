But some of the maps we\u2019ve seen online show Trump winning \u2014 they\u2019re simply inaccurate or, in one case, old, like this one showing results from the 2016 election.\nNow, a new Facebook post is spreading an unrealistic electoral map that shows Trump with a stunning 410 votes, and Biden at 128 votes.\n\"This is the actual results of the election,\" text above the map reads. \"People in Germany saw this before Dominion servers were seized. This will probably get removed so share as much as possible. The fraud is massive. Shame on these people.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThis is wrong.\u00a0\nThe map does not reflect the real election results, as the post claims, and there\u2019s no evidence any servers were seized. The map was aired by One America News Network, known as OAN or OANN, a pro-Trump cable network based in the U.S., and there is no evidence it surfaced in Germany.\nOAN included the map in a segment it aired on the unfounded conspiracy theory that the U.S. military seized election-related servers in Germany.\nIn a clip of the segment found on YouTube, an anchor is heard saying that \"new reports claim the real results of the 2020 U.S. election were found on a computer server that was seized by the U.S. military in Frankfurt, Germany.\"\nThe anchor then refers to a tweet with the map, which flashes on the screen, and says it's \"allegedly based off the data from that server\" and shows \"a landslide victory for President Trump with 410 electoral college votes including liberal strongholds, California and Minnesota.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map is sourced solely to a defeated congressional candidate Manga Anantatmula, and does not reflect state-certified election results. Among its wild inaccuracies: it awards all of California\u2019s 55 electoral votes to Trump. California has been won by Democrats in every presidential race since 1992, including 2020.\nWe previously debunked similar posts that said the U.S. Army raided Spanish election software company Scytl in Germany and seized its servers. Some versions claimed the servers had ties to Dominion.\nScytl said in a statement that the U.S. military hasn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t have seized any of its equipment, because it doesn\u2019t have offices in Germany. The Army also denied to the Associated Press that such an event took place.\u00a0\nThe company has delivered election modernization projects for U.S. elections since 2008, but none involve tallying votes, according to its website. The services include online initiatives like election worker training, electronic ballot delivery and real-time, visual representation of votes.\u00a0\nIn a statement rejecting the claims, Scytl said that its technologies for the U.S. are hosted and managed domestically by a Tampa-based subsidiary, SOE Software, and that it does not provide any voting machines in the U.S. or online voting services for U.S. elections.\nChris Krebs, the former director of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, who was fired by President Trump after he rejected claims of widespread voter fraud, took to Twitter to debunk the claim before leaving the agency.\u00a0\n\"Election-related servers WERE NOT recently seized in Europe by the US Army contrary to #disinfo rapidly spreading across social media,\" Krebs wrote.\nScytl and Dominion share no ties, according to statements from both companies.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post shares an electoral map that shows Trump beating Biden with 410 electoral votes, and says that people in Germany saw these real results before \"Dominion\u2019s servers were seized.\"\nThe map is not legitimate and was aired by a U.S. pro-Trump cable network. There\u2019s also no evidence of a U.S.-election related raid or server seizure in Germany.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17250"}
