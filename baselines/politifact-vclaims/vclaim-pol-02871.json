Trump had said players should be fired if they refused to stand.\n\"Fox Sports took things a step farther Sunday morning with a bombshell announcement that until players either stop disrespecting our country or are fired to do so, they will not be airing any games,\" the story read.\nThe story\u00a0linked to footage from Fox News Channel showing on-air personalities discussing the row between the president and the league.\nFox didn\u2019t really boycott any games, of course, because the story is fake. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 200 players across the NFL chose not to stand to show their opposition to Trump\u2019s criticism, and Fox still broadcast games on Sept. 24. The network has paid $1.1 billion for the rights to show National Football Conference games, plus playoff games and the Super Bowl every three years.\nThe same article also was reported in posts on several other websites, without any indication it was from TheLastLineOfDefense.org. That can cause confusion, because TheLastLineOfDefense.org runs only made-up stories.\nA footer note on the bottom of the page said \"everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction.\" The site\u2019s \"about us\" page included a disclaimer that read, \"We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.\"\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org was created by a man named Christopher Blair, who has told PolitiFact he writes absurd claims to fool conservative readers into believing wild stories.\nIt\u2019s not clear who wrote the story about Fox Sports. The author, who is only identified as \"Freedom\" on the site, replied to an email we sent, but would not provide their real name.\nIn any event, it\u2019s clear that Fox did not shun the NFL as part of a punitive campaign against players protesting the national anthem.\nWe rate this bogus claim Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-09-25 19:40:48 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  https://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-fox-sports-cancels-all-nfl-broadcasts-until-players-respect-the-flag/ \"Fox Sports cancels all NFL broadcasts \u2018until players respect the flag.\u2019 \"    TheLastLineOfDefense.org website   in a headline Sunday, September 24, 2017 2017-09-24    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02871"}
