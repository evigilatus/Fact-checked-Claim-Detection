In the latest twist, Scrima told aldermen he\u2019d give half of his future pay back to the city -- if they all returned to the city an equal share of their pay.\n\nBoy, the Flip-O-Meter was built for situations like this.\n\nIts purpose is to sort out if elected officials have changed their positions -- whether the switch is good or bad or in between is up to the voters.\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning:\n\nThe pledge\n\nDuring the campaign, Scrima routinely repeated the \"work for half\" pledge in literature, interviews and debates. It was an echo of sorts to the pledges made by Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker and other elected officials to return some of their pay to taxpayers.\n\nThe salary for the mayor of Waukesha is $70,100 a year and in April will increase to $73,100.\n\nScrima did not specify how he would handle the half of the salary that he would decline. But voters were clearly left with the impression that his pledge would reduce the cost to taxpayers.\n\nMost politicians simply return their unwanted pay to the municipal coffers. Under state law, Scrima had 30 days after the election to tell the city if he didn\u2019t want to accept full pay.\n\n\"The mayor did not do that,\" said Donna Whalen, human resources manager and assistant city attorney.\n\nSuch givebacks may make only a small difference in the bottom line -- Waukesha\u2019s general operations budget for 2011 is about $58 million, with $51.4 million to come from property taxes. But they can be popular with voters.\n\n\"Most people never look at the benefits of how you give money back,\" said Kevin Kennedy, director and general counsel for the state Government Accountability Board, adding: \"For most people it\u2019s a gesture.\"\n\nIn any case, Scrima did not take the most direct route to accomplish his goal.\n\n\nThe alternative path\n\nOn June 16, 2010, Scrima announced the creation of the \"New Day in Waukesha Fund\" and said half of his net pay (after taxes and health and dental insurance deductions) would be directly deposited to the fund with each pay day.\n\nHe launched the fund with a check for $2,787.34 - the amount that equaled half of his net pay for his first weeks in office. At the time, he said state law prohibited him from taking a half-sized paycheck. But that was only true because he missed the 30-day deadline to self-change the pay scale.\n\nHe could have written a check to the city with each paycheck, but did not.\n\nThe nonprofit fund, which echoes his campaign theme, is administered by a five-member board -- Scrima and four others he selected. The fund\u2019s stated purpose is to \"provide vitality\" to the city through creation of gateways, memorials, beautification and arts, and collaborative efforts that benefit young people. So far, no grants have been awarded.\n\nContributions to the fund are tax deductible.\n\nScrima said he hoped the community fund would \"leverage\" other contributions once projects were identified. And at the time of the announcement he declared he had secured \"additional commitments already totaling $26,700 from the community.\"\n\nBut so far, Scrima\u2019s checks are the only ones that have gone into the fund, said David Schultz, president of the Waukesha County Community Foundation Inc. which handles the money at the direction of the \"New Day\" board.\n\nSo, let\u2019s update the scorecard: Taxpayers are still paying Scrima\u2019s full salary. Instead of returning the money directly to city coffers, the giveback is being put -- after taxes -- into a fund that gives Scrima more control over how it is spent.\n\nDuring a recent meeting about the city budget, Ald. Chris Hernandez needled the mayor, saying it would help the tax levy if Scrima gave the money back to the city rather than his fund.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alternate alternative path\n\nOn Nov. 10, 2010, Scrima changed course.\n\nHe offered in a budget amendment to give half of his future pay back to the city as a way of preventing a tax levy increase. The catch: He would only do so if all 15 aldermen also agreed to pay cuts and return the money to the city.\n\nThat idea was dead on arrival, but it gives even more life to our analysis. If anything, the mayor\u2019s proposed amendment underlines that the money is not going to the city now.\n\n\"I believe I\u2019m living up to my campaign promise,\" Scrima told PolitiFact Wisconsin, arguing the city could enjoy greater benefits from his approach -- especially once others contribute to the fund. \"This is what I signed up for and I don\u2019t regret it.\"\n\nThe Flip-O-Meter came to a different conclusion.\n\nThe new mayor said he\u2019d work for half pay. But under his approach, he\u2019s taking the full salary and then putting money in a charitable fund, which carries tax advantages and control advantages. He has more say over how it is spent than if it went back to the city to hold down taxes. Creating the fund may be noble -- and clever, after all it is named after his campaign slogan. But it is not what voters could have expected based on his slogan. Scrima\u2019s latest effort, to leverage aldermen into his pledge, underlines the half-pay is doing nothing to help the city\u2019s bottom line.\n\nAll Scrima\u2019s bouncing on the half-pay pledge earns him a Half-Flip.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13983"}
