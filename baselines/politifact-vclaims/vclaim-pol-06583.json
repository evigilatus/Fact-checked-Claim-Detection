She has faced pushback from critics who assail her call for healthier school lunches as forcing kids to eat unappetizing meals\u00a0and who say she\u2019s second-guessing parents who know what\u2019s best for their kids better than the government does.\nNow, a new front against her has opened in the conservative blogosphere: Michelle Obama, critics say, is requiring day care centers to track their children\u2019s weight.\nA reader tipped us off to this social media phenomenon, which has been driven by such headlines as \"Michelle Obama Sending Government Monitors To Weigh Children In Daycare\" (downtrend.com), \"Government plans to weigh and measure your child in daycare,\" (American Thinker), \"Michelle O Mandates Weighing Children in Daycare,\" (InfoWars), and \"Michelle Obama Now Mandating Daycare Centers Weigh Kids\" (Western Journalism Center).\nSo is Michelle Obama really mandating the weighing of children in day care? No, this rumor is wildly overblown. Here\u2019s how it came about.\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Michelle Obama was a high-profile supporter of the measure -- she joined her husband in speaking at the bill-signing ceremony -- after it passed the Senate by unanimous consent and the House by a fairly (but not perfectly) party-line vote.\nThe law included a provision (section 223) for a Study on Nutrition and Wellness Quality in Childcare Settings, or SNAQCS. The study was designed to look at four topics: the nutritional quality of foods offered, the amount of physical activity, the amount of sedentary activity\u00a0and the ways that child care centers and family day care homes can improve their performance on these metrics.\nOn March 23, 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released details on the proposed study, along with a request for public comments.\n\"Good nutrition is a key to proper childhood development, but not enough is known about the food children are eating in child care and related programs,\" the document reads. Among other things, the study would involve a child food diary\u00a0to be completed by parents, a standing height and weight form\u00a0to be collected by study staff, an infant food intake form\u00a0and a parent interview.\nIf this were a mandatory requirement for all day care centers -- as the blogosphere trumpeted -- that would be pretty intrusive. But it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s a study of a limited number of day care centers and students. The USDA document says it will involve an estimated 3,000 children, 3,753 staff members at child care centers, family day care homes\u00a0and after-school childcare providers, and 4,175 parents.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a tiny fraction of the more than 30 million children in some form of day care -- about one ten-thousandth, to be exact.\nThe Agriculture Department told PolitiFact that the only mandatory aspect of the program is that all facilities receiving federal funding from the Child and Adult Care Food Program will have to fill out a form. Day care centers that don\u2019t participate in that program may be asked on a voluntary basis if they would like to take part as a control group.\nMoreover, only a small sampling of children at the federally supported centers would ever be weighed,\u00a0and parents would be allowed to opt their children out of the weighing part if they wish.\nThe headline of the article that sparked the flurry of social media commentary -- published by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website -- was more measured than the later iterations. The Free Beacon piece was titled, \"Feds to Weigh Children in Daycare: USDA collecting data for study mandated by Michelle Obama\u2019s healthy eating law.\" The Free Beacon mentioned the fact that the study was limited to 3,000 children high up in the story and quotes at length from the USDA\u2019s explanation of the purpose of the study.\nSome of the subsequent articles that appeared on the Internet also mentioned the size of the study and the department\u2019s justification for undertaking it, but the headlines glossed over these nuances. (Email inquiries to several of the publications in question were not returned.)\n\"I'm not responsible for how the blogosphere picks up my stories,\" Elizabeth Harrington, the Beacon reporter who wrote the story, told PolitiFact. \"Though other sites may have gone farther, the mandate in the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which the First Lady was largely responsible for, is still clear. And that's what I reported on.\"\nOur ruling\nBloggers say Michelle Obama \"mandates\" weighing children in day care.\nA law she supported -- that was passed by unanimous consent\u00a0in the Senate -- has set in motion a proposed study of how children in day care are eating, and part of the monitoring would include periodically weighing the participating students. However, the headlines of most of the posts on social media painted this as a sweeping, new requirement for all children in day care. That\u2019s not true -- the study aims to track 3,000 children, or about one ten-thousandth of all children in day care. We rate the claim False.\nCORRECTION, Mar. 27, 2015: This version corrects a mathematical error in the initial posting of this story. Three thousand children is one ten-thousandth of the 30 million children in day care nationally, not one ten-thousandth of 1 percent.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06583"}
