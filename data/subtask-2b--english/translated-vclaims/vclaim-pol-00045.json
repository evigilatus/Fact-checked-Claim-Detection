And I like to watch these senators and congressmen say the same old things about armed violence and listen to them get their asses from citizens who are tired of seeing 75 to 100 people killed a month and more than 200 injured by senseless violence. - Richard N. Ojeda, second (@VoteOjeda2020) 20 August 2019. When we contacted Ojeda, he said we should look at federal statistics and \"just do the research.\" We did, and we found that his numbers were actually undervalued. Official data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide the number of firearms-related deaths at the national level. The latest year for which data are available is 2017. The figures are as follows: Murders: 14,542 deaths from suicide weapons: 23,854 deaths from weapons Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 20 January 2021, which is working to achieve a total of 3,314 firearms-related deaths per month nationwide and 1,212 firearms-related deaths per month. Both figures are significantly higher than Ojeda estimates, which range from 75 to 100 per month. However, Ojeda's numbers would have been on the field if he were talking about firearms-related deaths on a daily basis. There are approximately 109 firearms-related deaths per day, of which 40 are homicides and 65 are suicides. We also checked to see if the numbers were working on firearms deaths in West Virginia alone. They don't -- in this case, the number is too small. The total deaths of 348 rifles in 2017, working to 29 per month, or nearly one per day, occurred in West Virginia. What about the injuries? The CDC has data on that, too. In 2015, the last available year, there were 84,997 non-lethal rifle injuries nationwide. This number is 7,083 per month, well above the 200-odd number. Here again, data are better suited if calculated on a daily basis. There were approximately 233 non-lethal injuries per day. This is not far from the number that Ojeda offered. However, his numbers are far from what he said in the tweet. \"75-100 people (they) have been killed for a month and more than 200 victims of meaningless weapon violence.\" In fact, Ojeda reduced the number of deaths and injuries caused by rifles. His figures are almost correct for murder and gun injury every day, instead of a month. We're mostly assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00045"}
