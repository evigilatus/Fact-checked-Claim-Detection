(A spokesman for the National Security Council responded to our inquiry, but did not provide any information to help evaluate Biden\u2019s claim.)\nAn annual report for 2019 by FireEye, a California cybersecurity company, says that late 2015 and 2016 \"saw Chinese cyber espionage activity begin to significantly decline, especially against the U.S.\"\nThe report noted the agreement, but also that China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, which did some of the hacking, consolidated its cyber-related functions and the Chinese government \"shifted its national priorities.\"\nThat decline did eventually reverse, however, according to two news accounts in November 2018.\nThe New York Times reported that \"for 18 months or so\" after the deal, \"the number of Chinese attacks plummeted,\" but soon after Trump took office, \"China\u2019s cyber-espionage picked up again and, according to intelligence officials and analysts, accelerated in the last year as trade conflicts and other tensions began to poison relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Rob Joyce, then a Trump senior adviser for cybersecurity strategy at the National Security Agency, said the agreement had significantly reduced the amount of Chinese cybertheft targeting American companies, but that China had violated the agreement and \"it is clear they are well beyond the bounds of the agreement today.\"\nThe Journal also reported that several private-sector cybersecurity firms concluded that China had been in violation of that deal roughly since Trump took office, but that some security experts said independent factors, including a reorganization of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, may have had more to do with the temporary decline in cybertheft.\nSo, a reduction took place after the agreement, something even a Trump official acknowledged, but even the evidence cited by Biden indicates the reduction may have been due to other factors, as well.\nOther views\nSeveral private cybersecurity experts we contacted agreed that the Obama deal was a major factor, though not the only one, in leading to the temporary reduction in China\u2019s cyber-thefts.\nThose experts are Inside Cybersecurity editor and co-founder Charlie Mitchell; James Andrew Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Christopher Painter, a member of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace who, while at the State Department under Obama, helped negotiate the deal with China; and Sean Kanuck, CEO of Exedec International and former U.S. national intelligence officer for cyber issues.\nThe deal may have saved American companies $15 billion a year, according to a 2017 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nBut we did not find consensus on the Trump administration\u2019s role in the uptick of Chinese cyber thefts.\nThe ramping up of the cyber-theft \"is because the Chinese decided to increase, not because of anything Trump did,\" said the center\u2019s James Andrew Lewis, who was the U.S. Commerce Department lead for national security and espionage concerns related to high-technology trade with China.\nLewis said China\u2019s economy was stronger when it made the agreement and that China underestimated how important cyber-theft is to supporting the country\u2019s economy.\nBut Mitchell and Painter said that as U.S. relations with China have deteriorated since Trump took office, China has had less incentive to comply with the agreement. \"At least one motivation that the Chinese had for complying went away as Trump started slapping on tariffs,\" Mitchell said.\nA final note: The experts agreed that when it comes to cyber thefts, there is no way to know exactly how much is occurring.\nOur rating\nBiden said: \"In the Obama-Biden administration, we got China to cut cyber-theft \u2014 it's gotten significantly worse under this administration.\"\nChina did reduce its cyber-theft from American companies in the wake of a groundbreaking deal it made in 2015 with the Obama administration, but other factors may also have led to the reduction.\nThe consensus among experts is that China\u2019s cyber-thefts have gone on the uptick since Trump took office, but other factors, such as a dip in China\u2019s economy, may have also played a role.\nWe rate Biden\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00532"}
