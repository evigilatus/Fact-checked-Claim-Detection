And as of this spring, fewer city residents were jobless than at any other time in at least three decades.\nSo there\u2019s good news on the jobs front that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could reasonably tout. Instead, he is now clinging to a variation of a boast we rated as False when we first heard him utter it in January.\nBack then, he declared Chicago in 2017 enjoyed the \"highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city.\" His revised variation narrows the comparison by more than a century and no longer explicitly confines it to workers in the private sector.\n\"Chicago is experiencing right now the highest employment since 1950,\" Emanuel declared recently during a public television interview on WTTW\u2019s \"Chicago Tonight\" program. A few minutes later in the interview, he repeated the point to underscore how attractive the city has become to employers.\nIs Emanuel now on more solid ground with his amended jobs claim than when we checked him early this year? We decided to take a second look.\nA numbers game\nEmanuel didn\u2019t explain the basis for his new claim. We sought clarification from a mayoral spokesman, but he did not provide it.\nBut, in a nutshell, the answer to our question is no. State and federal headcounters conduct different jobs tallies, but none render numbers that match the superlatives uttered by the mayor either now or in January.\nUnderlying our skepticism of Emanuel\u2019s initial claim was an obvious demographic reality: Chicago\u2019s population has been shrinking for decades and, at 2.7 million residents, is 900,000 fewer than its 1950 peak recorded by the Census.\nEarly this year, an Emanuel spokesman said the mayor\u2019s numbers came from an annual report from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. That report does not tally jobs held by Chicago residents, but rather private-sector jobs located in the city held by Chicagoans and suburbanites alike.\nFor 2017, that report showed 1.18 million private-sector jobs in the city, the highest number reported by the state since 1990 when it recorded 1.2 million private-sector jobs for Chicago. But the report series dates back to the late 1950s, and for most years prior to 1990, the city\u2019s private-sector jobs count far exceeded its 2017 tally.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\nIt is also important to note that state officials say their private-sector jobs report has not been updated since Emanuel spoke last January, so nothing has changed in the intervening months that could make his false claim true based on state figures.\nOf course, Emanuel did not limit his WTTW comments to private-sector jobs. But his argument would fall just as flat if he meant to refer to the broader measure of all jobs held by Chicagoans\u2014whether inside city limits or not.\nFor example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegged Chicago\u2019s preliminary employment numbers for May, the most recent available, at 1,286,424. That is up more than 76,000 from May 2010 during the depth of the Great Recession.\nBut in 2000, BLS numbers for Chicago employment exceeded today\u2019s count by more than 32,000; in 1989 they were more than 60,000 higher; in 1984 more than 103,000 higher; and in 1976 nearly 215,000 greater.\nOur ruling\nEmanuel said the city is experiencing its \"highest employment since 1950,\" a variation of a claim he made in January about Chicago\u2019s private-sector employment hitting the highest level in city history.\nBut Chicago has a much smaller population these days than it did in the post-war era, so it stands to reason that jobs numbers would shrink over the decades as well. And they have.\nStill, the city\u2019s employment picture these days is indisputably brighter than it was just a few years ago.\nPreliminary federal figures for May show city jobless numbers at 48,602, down from nearly 170,000 in 2010. And the state\u2019s private-sector jobs report, which the mayor\u2019s office gestured to last time around, shows improvement as well\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t match the mayor\u2019s rhetoric.\nYet Emanuel continues to dwell on claims of job benchmarks that don\u2019t exist instead of the ones that do. He was wrong the first time we checked him and he is wrong again now. We rate his latest statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-09 22:28:19 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Chicago is experiencing right now the highest employment since 1950.\"     Rahm Emanuel Chicago mayor    television interview Thursday, June 28, 2018 2018-06-28    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01886"}
