Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. While they were supposed to talk about infrastructure, Trump walked out of the meeting, Pelosi said, questioning Trump\u2019s intentions to work on policy. \"It was very, very, very strange,\" Pelosi said of the brief encounter with Trump.\nThe real audio from C-SPAN is noticeably different than what Politics WatchDog posted.\nWe sent experts links to the Facebook post and to C-SPAN\u2019s coverage of the event.\n\"The one on Facebook shows more slurred and lisping than the one on C-SPAN,\" said Siwei Lyu, an associate professor of computer science at the University at Albany, State University of New York, whose research includes digital media forensics.\nLyu analyzed the audio tracks and said there was \"a clear frequency difference,\" with the audio on the Facebook video showing signs of stretching.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can hear artifacts in the audio that would be consistent with the video being slowed and the audio being stretched,\" said Cole Whitecotton, an IT professional at the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado Denver.\nThe Facebook video also contains duplicate frames, said Matthew C. Stamm, an assistant professor at Drexel University.\n\"The number and placement of duplicate frames in this video are unlikely to happen in an original video, and are a strong indicator that this video has been modified,\" said Stamm, who focuses on developing techniques to detect falsified images and videos.\nIt\u2019s more difficult to prove whether the video was purposefully manipulated or just sounds different due to poor streaming or other video capture and encoding issues, experts said.\nPolitics WatchDog\u2019s video has at least 2.4 million views and has been shared at least 47,000 times. We reached out to Politics WatchDog for comment but did not hear back by deadline.\n\"Just for the record we never claimed that Speaker Pelosi was drunk. We can\u2019t control what the people in the comments think. It\u2019s a free country. For your information we are not a conservative news outlet. Washington Post is fake news!\" Politics WatchDog wrote in a May 23 Facebook post.\nTrump on May 23 tweeted a separate video also taking a jab at Pelosi. \"PELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE,\" Trump tweeted, along with a video from Fox Business which showed a compilation of instances in which Pelosi repeated, rephrased or stumbled over some words. Commentators in the video questioned \"what\u2019s going on\" with Pelosi.\nPelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, on Twitter called the second video, the one in Trump\u2019s tweet, \"doctored\" and linked to the Washington Post\u2019s report of inaccurate videos about Pelosi growing on social media.\nThat second video is certainly edited to paint Pelosi in the worst light. But side by side footage of the video Trump shared with another version captured by journalists shows that Pelosi\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t manipulated. And, importantly, the video Trump shared on Twitter is not the same one that was posted by Politics WatchDog.\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook video giving the impression that Pelosi slurred her speech at a public event isn\u2019t an accurate account of how she spoke at the event.\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2019-05-24 15:10:11 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Video shows Nancy Pelosi slurring her speech at a public event.
