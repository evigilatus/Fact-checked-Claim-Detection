He said: \"The implications of the progress made in the eradication of crime have now been reflected by the decline of this administration from criminal law enforcement.\" \"Dead killings last year increased by 17 per cent in the 50 largest cities in America. This is the largest increase in 25 years.\" We'll give Trump credit for holding on to what we assume is his source. We identified an almost similar passage in an article published in January 2016 by the Wongblog Team in Washington Post: \"The number of murders in the country's top 50 cities has risen by almost 17% last year, the largest increase in deadly violence in a quarter century,\" the article began. The article cited the Wongberg accounts. However, Trump ignored some important cautionary remarks in that same story. The post article says that a closer look at the numbers suggests no single explanation for the increases and does not reveal a clear pattern among the cities that have experienced the most terrible violence. For example, the article indicated that other data showed a more modest increase. \"A preliminary FBI report last week showed that the total number of violent crimes increased only 1.7 per cent nationwide during the first half of the year while the number of property crimes decreased 4.2 per cent.\" The article also indicated that these increases are scattered. \"There was more killing in Nashville, but the total in Memphis fell by 1%,\" said Post. \"The number of murders increased by 25 percent in Houston, but decreased by 9 percent in San Antonio. The number of homicides in the past year was seven fewer than in 2014 in Fresno, Califf, a 15 per cent decrease. Meanwhile, on Highway 99 in Sacramento, there were 43 murders last year, an increase of 54 per cent.\" \"There is no national pattern,\" said Franklin Zimering, Crimeologist at the University of California at Berkeley, Post. Darryl Stevens, Executive Director of the Association of Mayors of Major Cities, agreed. \"Everything is basically a tale,\" he said to Boston. \"There is no clear national picture that you have been able to identify what might be contributing to the changes.\" James Allen Fox, interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University, told Poletti Fact that the most recent data was strongly driven by four large cities with disproportionate increases - Chicago, Houston, Washington, Baltimore. Fox and others urged Polyte Vac not to make much change in the data over a period of one year. It would be better to look at a set of years to see where the trends are going. \"There's a fluctuation in numbers like this,\" he said. Marco Rubio mentioned on January 27, 2021 in his remarks \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" This fell to less than 400 in each of the next two years before rising again to the highest 400 in 2015. \"In non-theoretically, some time when the numbers rise may be because there was an unusually low number in the previous year. A one-year change is not a reliable trend, \"Fox said. In the long run, violent crime rates have moved in the right direction. As we have noted before, the data of the Federal Bureau of Investigation show that violent crimes have been declining on a semi-continuous basis since the early 1990s. The data below show violent crime per 100,000 population from 1993 to 2014, the last full year for which data are available. \"Killer rates have steadily declined since 1993 through both republican and democratic presidents,\" said Raymond Patterson, from the University of Maryland of Criminology. As a result of this long-term decline, the crime rate was \"low for a long time so that the small increase would be a significant increase by a large percentage,\" said Alan Lisette, Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of Albany. Our Governor Trump said, \"Killing last year increased by 17 per cent in the 50 largest cities in America. This is the largest increase in 25 years.\" The statement comes from a reliable source - accounts by the Washington Post. However, in drawing a gloomy picture, the Cherry Trump captures the general results of the Post -- and makes mistakes that crime scientists warn of. The post article acknowledged that the FBI data had increased less in recent years, with contradictory results for many cities. Experts caution against placing many stocks in short-term changes, as data from year to year can be volatile for reasons that are difficult to distinguish. We have lost in Tramp's formulation that violent crime in general has been constantly collapsing for almost a quarter of a century. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores facts that give a different impression, so we evaluate his claim half correct. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/729f9ae-3336-4971-8c96-52b25f6b4e25", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04640"}
