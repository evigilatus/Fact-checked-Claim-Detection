Ken Paxton of McKinney claimed Barry Smitherman, an opponent in the race for Texas attorney general, \"doesn\u2019t have enough legal experience to apply for most of the jobs at the attorney general\u2019s office.\"\nSmitherman, who chairs the state Railroad Commission, \"has only 15 months of total legal experience,\" said Paxton, vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee and a former House member, who said he has 22 years\u2019 experience practicing law.\nThat 15-month figure didn\u2019t hold up, though Smitherman separately acknowledged that he has spent less than three years practicing law.\nThe others bidding for attorney general in the March 4, 2014, primary elections are also lawyers. Republican state Rep. Dan Branch of Dallas, who chairs the House Higher Education Committee, is a senior attorney and shareholder in corporate law firm Winstead PC; campaign spokesman Enrique Marquez told us by email Branch has practiced law for 30 years.\nThe lone Democrat is Sam Houston, a Houston lawyer unrelated to the historical figure of the same name, who is nearing 27 years of private legal practice, as we noted in a 2013 fact-check.\nTraditionally, the state attorney general has been a lawyer, though according to the Secretary of State\u2019s office, the Texas Constitution doesn\u2019t require a law license or legal experience for the job, which was created in 1845, when legal qualifications were less formal.\nThe attorney general does act as the state\u2019s lawyer, often filing lawsuits at the request of a department or branch of state government, as well as litigating cases, defending state laws and providing legal advice; another duty is approving public bond issues.\nAsked for his response to Paxton\u2019s claim, Smitherman told us by phone, \"Well, first of all, most of the jobs over there are non-judicial; they\u2019re non-lawyer jobs. So that\u2019s patently false.\"\nPaxton spokeswoman Ashley Sewell told us via email that Paxton\u2019s comment \"was obviously given in the context of legal qualifications and legal jobs which require a licensed attorney. \u2026 (T)he lack of Barry Smitherman\u2019s legal experience keeps him from being qualified for more than half of those jobs.\"\nSewell emailed us information on employees in the attorney general\u2019s office pulled from the Texas Tribune\u2019s online data portal. She said that of 718 \"legal personnel,\" 515 were classed as assistant attorney general employment grade IV or above. That, she said, meant the 515 positions required three or more years\u2019 legal experience; as backup, she sent two 2014 job postings -- one requiring three years for a level IV assistant attorney general opening and another requiring four years for a level V assistant attorney general job.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn behalf of the AG\u2019s office, spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us by email that the agency has 4,073 employees, of whom 734 are lawyers, with 717 of those being categorized as assistant attorney general classifications I through VII. She said that the agency requires three years or more experience for classes IV and up; those categories account for 509 lawyer positions.\nMost of the remaining \"lawyer\" jobs are director positions and the post of first assistant attorney general; these don\u2019t have a specific legal experience requirement attached. Rather, the job descriptions call for \"experience relevant to the assignment\" and possibly a law license in a specialty area.\nSo 509 AAG positions at the agency require three or more years\u2019 legal experience. That\u2019s 70 percent of the total \"lawyer\" jobs on staff and 13 percent of all the agency\u2019s jobs.\nSmitherman told us he practiced as a briefing attorney and municipal bond attorney from 1984 to 1985, earned a master\u2019s degree in public administration and spent 16 years in investment banking, then began a second career as a prosecutor in the Harris County district attorney\u2019s office and was there 15 months before Gov. Rick Perry appointed him to the Public Utilities Commission in 2004. He was promoted to PUC chairman in 2007, then appointed in 2011 to the Railroad Commission, which he has chaired since 2012.\n\"If you\u2019re going to do a just-math exercise on how long I was in a law firm and how long I was in the Harris County DA\u2019s office, that\u2019s about two years and three months,\" he said. But, he said, \"I think I probably could have come out of the Harris County DA\u2019s office as a baby prosecutor and gotten a job in the AG\u2019s office\" because the Harris County office is so large and so busy. A year there, where his typical morning could start with a hundred or more cases to plead out or pursue, is like \"dog years,\" Smitherman said.\nOur ruling\nPaxton said Smitherman \"doesn\u2019t have enough legal experience to apply for most of the jobs at the attorney general\u2019s office.\"\nMost of the jobs at the attorney general\u2019s office -- 87 percent -- don\u2019t require any legal experience at all. Of the 734 jobs that do, 70 percent have a minimum qualification of three years or more, which Smitherman would not meet.\nWe rate Paxton\u2019s statement, which could have used clarification that he was focusing on lawyer jobs, as Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08202"}
