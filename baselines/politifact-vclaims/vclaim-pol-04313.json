Earlier this week, it called out opponent Katie McGinty for the lack of debates in Central Pennsylvania and suggested she is avoiding the area out of fear.\nThe insinuation, the Toomey press release explained, had to do with a comment she made to theJewish Exponent: \"McGinty previously\u00a0told a local community newspaper\u00a0in her native Philadelphia that she \u2018has found an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the \u2018T\u2019 part of the state\u2019 outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\"\nNot exactly what you want to say for a part of the state that includes a few million people. But did McGinty really say that to the\u00a0Jewish Exponent?\nWe need to go back a few months to tackle this fact check. On March 30,\u00a0an article\u00a0about McGinty\u2019s candidacy ran in the\u00a0Exponent, headlined \"McGinty holds a strong \u2018Jewish\u2019 identity.\" The article mostly featured McGinty\u2019s beliefs about America\u2019s relationship with Israel and some memories of her growing up in Northeast Philly. Per the conservative-leaning\u00a0Washington Free Beacon, the article\u00a0first contained\u00a0a paraphrase of her thoughts on Central Pennsylvania voters in a quote about the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel: \"It\u2019s really so dangerous, so misdirected,\" said McGinty, who has found an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the T part of the state outside the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg Jewish strongholds. \"I am 100 percent opposed and shocked. It could not be more ill-conceived.\"\nBut on April 4 the article was corrected. Again according to the\u00a0Free Beacon, the segment of the article was changed to read, \"It\u2019s really so dangerous, so misdirected,\" said McGinty, who has found people in the \"T\" part of the state outside the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg Jewish strongholds are unaware of BDS\u2019 dangers. \"I am 100 percent opposed and shocked. It could not be more ill-conceived.\"\nIt was later corrected the same day to include only the quote and no paraphrase about people in Central Pennsylvania.\nJoshua Runyan, editor-in-chief of the\u00a0Exponent, said the McGinty campaign contacted the paper and claimed McGinty never said anything similar to what she was paraphrased as saying in the article. He said he listened the recording of the interview and concluded nothing in the conversation could justify what was paraphrased in the article and his reporter, Jon Marks, had made a mistake. \u00a0\u00a0\n\"Quite frankly,\" Runyan said, \"I\u2019m surprised that it\u2019s still an issue because she did not say it.\"\nThe correction wasn\u2019t made until after Republican Congressman Joe Pitts wrote McGinty a letter on April 4 condemning the comment. McGinty\u2019s campaign said it approached the\u00a0Exponent\u00a0once it became aware of the comment.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Corman\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays unproven voter fraud claims didn\u2019t play \u201cany role\u201d in the Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe timing rankled Toomey\u2019s campaign, which pointed out McGinty\u00a0shared the article\u00a0on Twitter on April 1, days before the correction was made. \u00a0\u00a0\n\"The easiest way to solve this problem is for McGinty to release the audio from her interview,\" said Ted Kwong, a spokesperson for Toomey\u2019s campaign. \"She has refused.\"\nMcGinty\u2019s campaign said it does not have a recording of the interview. But after this article was first published\u00a0Free Beacon\u00a0reporter Brent Scher shared an email exchange with a McGinty campaign aide saying she recorded the interview and had re-listened to the conversation between McGinty and the\u00a0Exponent\u00a0reporter.\nRunyan declined to share a recording of the interview saying the\u00a0Exponent\u00a0has a policy of not releasing audio of interviews to other organizations.\nOur Ruling\nPat Toomey\u2019s campaign circulated a press release earlier this week claiming Katie McGinty told theJewish Exponent\u00a0she found \"an alarming undercurrent of misinformed people in the T part of the state\u2019 outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\"\nBut the newspaper corrected the article to remove the paraphrase attributed to McGinty several months ago, after the McGinty campaign complained. The paper\u2019s editor, Joshua Runyan, said the recording revealed McGinty had made no such comment. Toomey\u2019s campaign wants the recording released and considers the timing of the correction fishy, given McGinty tweeted the article after it was first published and the\u00a0Exponent\u2019s correction wasn\u2019t made until after Republican politicians called out McGinty for the comment.\nThe tape of the interview, unfortunately, was not made available by the\u00a0Exponent, and the McGinty campaign said it doesn\u2019t have a recording. Because of the correction from the\u00a0Exponent\u00a0and the editor\u2019s claim McGinty said nothing to justify the original comment, there is no proof McGinty said anything about finding an alarming amount of misinformed people in Central Pennsylvania.\nWe rule the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04313"}
