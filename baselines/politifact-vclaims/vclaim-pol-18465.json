Trump beat Hillary Clinton in a similarly close battle for the state four years ago, and Biden\u2019s win will undoubtedly shape the outcome of the national race.\u00a0\nBut an influx of absentee ballots cast in Wisconsin because of the coronavirus pandemic meant results took longer than usual to come in \u2014 allowing rumors and false information to fill in the gaps.\u00a0\n\"Wisconsin took a break, and when they returned, Biden coincidentally came back ahead by 100k,\" stated a tweet posted early on Nov. 4, 2020.\u00a0\nThe tweet was cited in a viral Facebook post that claimed several key states with Democratic governors took a break from counting votes on election night.\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

That included an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots that workers could not start counting until Election Day, per state law.\u00a0\nBy the morning of the election, more than 1.9 million people had returned absentee ballots.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump enjoyed a lead of more than 100,000 votes in Wisconsin early in the night, but the picture quickly changed after the City of Milwaukee\u2019s central count finished processing mail-in votes around 3:30 a.m. Milwaukee and 38 other municipalities tally all of their absentee ballots at one location, instead of individual polling places.\nIt\u2019s perfectly legal, but has the practical effect of large numbers being added at the same time. Other municipalities in the state count absentee ballots at the precinct level, so they are tallied along with in-person votes.\u00a0\nThe late boost for Biden from Milwaukee was expected, especially because mail-in ballots tend to skew toward Democrats and Milwaukee is a Democratic stronghold.\u00a0\nAfter Milwaukee reported those returns, Biden jumped ahead of Trump by about 8,000 votes. His lead widened to around 20,000 after Green Bay reported in-person and absentee results and Kenosha finished its tally.\nSo, two things: Biden was never up by 100,000 votes, and he will certainly not win Wisconsin by that much. It\u2019s also ridiculous to suggest Wisconsin election officials \"took a break\" when they spent all night processing ballots. A delay in results does not mean the counting process stopped.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, people were permitted to observe the counting of absentee ballots in Wisconsin;\u00a0 and Green Bay and Milwaukee even live-streamed the process online.\u00a0\n\"I think that it\u2019s insulting for local election officials to say yesterday\u2019s election was anything but an incredible success that was the result of years of preparation and meticulously, carefully following the law,\" Meagan Wolfe, the commission\u2019s director, said in a news conference the morning after the election.\nThe Facebook poster did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook post cites a tweet that claimed, \"Wisconsin took a break, and when they returned, Biden coincidentally came back ahead by 100k.\"\nThe Democratic nominee never held that great of a lead in Wisconsin, even when the Associated Press called the race. And some of the state\u2019s election results arrived late due to an influx of mail-in ballots \u2014 not because officials \"took a break.\"\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18465"}
