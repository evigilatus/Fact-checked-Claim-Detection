In a speech in Iowa Og 20, Biden said: \"David Duke, President of Ko Klux Klan, former President of Klan. When that group came out of the woods, he said that the fields, which carry those torches, \"That's why we voted for Donald Trump.\" He said he'd get the country back. White patriot, Richard Spencer. He welcomed Trump. He said, \"This is the white nationalism we were looking for. ' Have you ever spoken the word \"convincing\"? Biden didn't answer his question, but he was clearly stating that Trump didn't condemn either of the racist leaders. Biden accurately quoted Duke's comments on Trump, and Spencer welcomed Trump. But Paiden exaggerates when he says Trump never convicted the Duke. Trump's condemnation of the Duke dates back decades, although Trump was sometimes stronger than other times. Trump also criticized the demonstrations in which Spencer participated. But Trump also said that there were \"very cool people on both sides\" in Charlottesville in \"V\" on the march. What Trump said about David Duke in 2016, we checked the fact that Trump refused to denounce KKK. We rated the statement mostly wrong. The announcement distorted Trump's record by choosing one cherry interview in which Jake Taber of CNN Trump asked about Duke in February 2016. Duke founded Louisiana's class from KKK in 1974, but left in 1980 because of his tendency to violence. Since then, Duke has been a remarkable white radical. Taber Trump asked if he wouldn't want white fanatics to vote. Trump answered: \"Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know which group you're talking about. You don't want me to convict a group I don't know about. I have to look. If you send me a list of groups, I'll do a search. And certainly, I would deny if I thought something was wrong.\" And then Trump blamed a bad earpiece, saying he could barely hear the questions. In the days that followed, Trump refused to support Duke in the interviews in the morning of America and in the morning of Good Joe, and he called him \"a bad person whom I denied on many occasions over the years.\" The Paiden campaign referred to that interview when we asked them to provide evidence in support of Baiden &apos; s claim. The campaign also referred us to cases where Trump denied knowing anything about the Duke or giving him denial. We found Trump convicted of Duke years before he met Taber. In 1991, Larry King asked CNN Trump about Duke's success with white voters in a failed bid for Louisiana Governor. Trump replied: \"I hate to see what he represents, but I think he just shows that there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a huge amount of hostility in the United States.\" In 2000, Trump refused to run a presidential bidding for the Reform Party, partly because the party attracted Duke's support. Trump also called Duke a fanatic, racist, trouble. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u25cf January 16, 2012, during the Trump bid in 2016, Duke denied, but it was not as strong as some of his earlier reprimands. In 2015, when Tramp was asked about Duke &apos; s near support, he replied that he did not want to support it. He asked me if he was gonna say no to Duke, and he said, \"Sure, I'll do it, if it makes you feel better. I don't know anything about him. Someone told me yesterday, whoever it was, he believed me. I actually don't think it was a endorsement. He said I was the best of all candidates.\" In 2016, when Trump was asked for Duke &apos; s support, he said he was not aware of that. He said, \"I didn't even know he supported me.\" David Duke believed me? Okay, okay. I'm banished, okay? Sometimes Trump seemed mad at the question. \"I totally banished Chloe Clox Klan,\" said in the debate. \"I totally reject David Duke. I've been doing this for two weeks now, maybe you're the 18th person who asked me the question.\" What Trump said about the events led by Spencer was not an example when Trump was asked to denounce Spencer by name. But Trump criticized the events in which Spencer, head of the White Identity Thinking Centre, played a key role. In November 2016, a reporter from The New York Times Trump asked about a recent conference in Washington, D.C., for those who had pledged allegiance to the Nazis. Trump said, \"Of course I do. I deny and condemn.\" At the conference, Spencer greeted the supporters of Hale Trump. Spencer was one of the leaders behind the United in Charlottesville, Fa, in August 2017, where an extremist white man threw a car at Brewster counter, killing her. The Trump statement of August 12, 2017 blamed \"many aspects,\" thus diminishing his comprehensive message of intolerance. \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this heinous display of hatred, intolerance and violence on the part of many parties, on the other hand.\" \"It's been happening for a long time in our country.\" In the following days, Trump condemned intolerance, neo-Nazis and white nationalists. But in the same breath he told journalists as well, \"You also had people who were very good, on both sides.\" In other cases, Trump condemned hate or racial groups without mentioning any racist leader. After the mass shooting in El Paso, Trump condemned the shooter, who said that he had published a statement \"using racial hatred.\" Our judgment said that Trump did not condemn Duke and Spencer. This is an exaggeration. Trump Duke was not convicted when he asked for it in an interview with Taber on CNN in 2016. But decades ago, he clearly condemned the former PKK leader -- and he did it after meeting Taber, too. Some of his denial was short. We cannot find an example of the conviction of Tramp Spencer by name or ask him to do so, but he criticized the gatherings in which Spencer, a white national, played a key role, including Charlottesville. But Trump has sometimes diminished his condemnation of racism. The most notable thing is that Trump said that there are \"very wonderful people on both sides\" on the Charlottesville march. In other times, his denunciations seemed to be hesitating. But he made them. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00231"}
