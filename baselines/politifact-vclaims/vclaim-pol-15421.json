But I didn't campaign on a public option. I think it is a good idea. But as I said in that speech on Sept. 9 (on health care), it is just one small element of a broader reform effort. And so we don't feel that the core elements to help the American people that I campaigned on and that we've been fighting for all year have been compromised in any significant way.\"\n\n\nWe got an e-mail from a reader pointing out Obama's statement that he \"did not campaign on a public option.\" How can that be, the reader asked, when the public option was clearly part of Obama's platform?\n\n\nWe agree that the public option was part of Obama's platform. It's\n\na promise we've listed\n\nin our database of Obama's campaign promises.\n\n\nIt says that through a new health care exchange, \"any American will have the opportunity to enroll in the new public plan or an approved private plan, and income-based sliding scale tax credits will be provided for people and families who need it.\"\n\n\nBut, we also have to say that the public option was not a very prominent part of Obama's platform. We added the promise in August after the public option became an intense part of the debate. We were able to find the proposal pretty quickly after looking in Obama's campaign literature, but he didn't discuss it very much during the campaign. That's true for both the general election and the Democratic primary.\n\n\nIf you look for mentions of the public option in Obama's speeches or comments to voters, you'll find very few. In fact, Obama gave a major address in Iowa on May 29, 2007, outlining his health care plan in considerable detail. There's not one mention of the public option in his speech.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Democratic primary's big health care battle was over whether there should be\n\nan individual mandate\n\nthat required people to buy health insurance. Candidates Hillary Clinton and John Edwards said there should be a mandate; Obama was opposed. Obama said that people don't buy insurance because they can't afford it, not because they don't want to, and it was wrong to force them.\n\n\nWhen negotiations began on health care legislation in 2009, however, Obama changed his position and supported the mandate. (We gave him a\n\nFull Flop on our Flip-O-Meter\n\n.)\n\n\nSo during the campaign, the public option was not mentioned much.\n\n\nBut since we track campaign promises, we believe candidates should be held accountable for all their promises, and that includes things they have in their campaign literature. It's up to voters to decide whether the public option --\n\nPromise No. 518\n\n-- is more or less important than Obama's other promises.\n\n\nObama's new claim is, \"I didn't campaign on a public option.\" We will stipulate that it was not a particularly prominent part of his overall platform for health care. But we find that the public option was part of Obama's campaign materials, and that counts. So we rate his statement Barely True.\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15421"}
