Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is among those opposed to the six-month deal, in which the United States agreed to lessen sanctions on Iran in exchange for certain limits placed on Iran\u2019s growing nuclear program. The deal was brokered by the P5+1, the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany.\nIn his press release, Rubio highlighted a notoriously rocky relationship between the two countries, calling Iran a \"rogue state.\" He went on to criticize the country\u2019s leadership.\n\"Just days ago, Iran's Supreme Leader (Ali) Khamenei, who will oversee implementation of this agreement, was calling Israel a 'rabid dog' and accusing the United States of war crimes,\" he said.\nWe wanted to see if Rubio\u2019s claim was right and what evidence it was based on.\nKhamenei\u2019s role\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from Rubio\u2019s office, but we found that Khamenei gave a speech on Nov. 20, prior to the public announcement of the agreement.\nKhamenei is Iran\u2019s appointed supreme leader and the country\u2019s head of state. He holds more power in Iran than even President Hassan Rouhani, who is widely considered a moderate. Many analysts credit Rouhani\u2019s election with making the recent agreement possible.\nAs we\u2019ll see, Khamenei\u2019s takes a more hard-line approach toward both the United States and Israel than Rouhani.\nKhamenei is in charge of all of Iran\u2019s foreign policy, including the nuclear agreement. But it\u2019s worth noting that since he\u2019s so high-ranking, he won\u2019t be heavily involved in day-to-day operations -- that\u2019s left to nuclear physicists and other lower-ranking officials.\n\"Rabid dog\"\nU.S. and Iranian news outlets reported that Khamenei said something about a \"rabid dog\" in a speech Nov. 20, less than a week before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced a deal with Iran.\nWe saw conflicting reports in the direct translation of the phrase from Farsi to English. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear to us whether Khamenei directed the comment toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, all Israeli people or all Jewish people.\nPolitiFact asked two Farsi-speaking Iranian political science experts for independent translations of the line in question. We showed the experts the Farsi speech transcript published on Khamenei\u2019s official website. We also consulted an English-language video translation from Press TV, a state-owned news outlet in Iran.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found small discrepancies in the exact translation:\n\n\n\"Israel is the rabid dog of the region,\" was the wording Syracuse University Iranian studies professor Mehrzad Boroujerdi put forward, which closely matches many news reports we\u2019ve seen.\n\n\n\"These Zionist financiers are really like wild beasts,\" was the wording Middle East Institute scholar Alex Vatanka gave us. He told us \"wild beasts\" and \"rabid dogs\" were not so far off from each other in Farsi. \"Zionist financiers,\" he said, is a clear reference to the Israeli government, especially Netanyahu.\n\n\n\"Israeli officials cannot be called humans. They are like animals, some of them.\" That\u2019s from the Press TV translator.\n\n\nExact wording aside, the sentiment is largely the same. Khamenei did in fact call either government officials or the country as a whole the animals of the Middle East.\nThat\u2019s consistent with Khamenei\u2019s overall stance, Vatanka said, adding that the leader previously referred to Israel as a \"cancerous tumor\" on the region. But Khamenei\u2019s comments don\u2019t necessarily reflect the way other Iranian officials or the public feels about Israel, Vatanka added.\n\"War crimes\"\nRubio also said that Khamenei recently accused the United States of carrying out war crimes. When we watched the speech, we found truth to that.\n\"They committed crimes in Iraq, in Pakistan with drones. Still they are committing crimes with drones,\" he said, according to the Press TV translation. \"In Afghanistan they bombard people and they continue to commit crimes. Anywhere in which they can serve their interests, they will commit crimes including torture, killings, the Guantanamo prison.\"\nThat\u2019s not an unusual statement for Khamenei.\n\"The man\u2019s position on the United States has always been that the United States is unjust in its policies, it\u2019s arrogant in its policies and it\u2019s not trustworthy,\" Vatanka said. But at the same time, Khamenei has always supported reaching out to the United States when he feels the timing is right, Vatanka added.\n\"(Iranian officials) would not have been sitting in Geneva negotiating with Kerry if they didn\u2019t have the green light from Khamenei.\"\nOur ruling\nRubio said, \"Just days ago, Iran's Supreme Leader (Ali) Khamenei, who will oversee implementation of this agreement, was calling Israel a 'rabid dog' and accusing the United States of war crimes.\" Based on expert translations, we confirmed that Khamenei referred to either Israel or the Israeli government as the animals of the Middle East. In the same speech, he criticized the United States, saying they \"continue to commit crimes\" in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay.\nWe rate Rubio\u2019s statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08555"}
