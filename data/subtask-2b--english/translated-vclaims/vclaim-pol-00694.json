No.", "text": "With the announcement of the bulk of Special Adviser Robert M\u00f8ller &apos; s report now, President Donald Trump seized his assets as evidence that he was a victim. On several occasions, Trump used the word \"coop\" to describe the efforts of law enforcement agencies to investigate Russia's influence in the 2016 elections. For example, in an interview with Sean Hannetti from Fox News on April 25, 2019, he said: \"This was a coup. This was an attempt to overthrow the U.S. government. .................................................................................... I think it's much bigger than Watergate. I think it's probably the biggest scandal in the political history of this country. Maybe more than politics. That was a coup. This wasn't stealing information from an office in Watergate Apartments. This was a coup attempt.\" We wondered whether Trump was justified by the fact that he was targeted in a coup d'\u00e9tat -- a shortcut to the term \"coup d'\u00e9tat,\" a French term that meant overthrowing the government. The experts told us that Trump's use of the term was wrong, both practical and legal. What does Trump refer to? The White House did not respond to a query about this article, but Philip Pump in the Washington Post described the origins of the talking point as part of the \"Classical Fawkes News Refuge.\" Trump seems to believe that the enemies in the law's sphere of application had reason to join him because of his contacts with Russia in his campaign. Among the names that often appear in this so-called conspiracy are Peter Struzok and Lisa Paige, officials involved in the FBI investigation of Trump, which was then identified. They were emotionally involved and exchanged text messages that Trump said were biased against. (Trap regularly attacks Struzk and Twitter page; in an interview with Haniti, he called them \"patient lovers.\") For those outside Fox News, communications \"may not make sense,\" Bump writes. \"But for the scenes of Hannity, and for Trump and Hannity in particular, it all makes perfect sense. It's a summary of a case about bias, personal flaws and injustice created by Fox News and Hanetti a year ago.\" The evolution of this \"nutrient ring\" can be seen in Trump tweeting. In the weeks leading up to the appearance of Hanetti, where Trump referred to a coup d'\u00e9tat, he repeated or quoted many allies on Twitter using the term. The first was the pro-Trump Dan Bongino commentator who said in Fox and Friends on February 18 that \"This was an illegal coup attempt against the President of the United States.\" Trump also tweeted or retweeted Tom Feyton from the provincial oversight group and Maria Barteromo from the Fox Business Network using the word \"coop\" before appearing on Haiti. How did the investigation actually begin, according to Muller's report, the stimulating event of the FBI opened the counter-intelligence investigation into the links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government came as a result of the April 2016 meeting between campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and a source who said that Russian government officials could present a \"fault\" to Clinton in the form of \"thousands of e-mails.\" The Muller report confirms previous reports on the sequence of events that moved the probe. In May 2016, a high-ranking Australian diplomat in a high-level bar in London said that Moscow had \"political dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of e-mails. In late July 2016, a few days after WikiLeaks dropped thousands of internal documents issued by the National Democratic Committee, which proved to be detrimental to Clinton, American law enforcement authorities realized the claim of Papadopolous. \"A week after the release (Wikileaks), a foreign government reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) its interaction in May 2016 with Papadopoulos and its statement that the Russian Government could assist the Trump campaign,\" said the Muller Report (p. 6, vol. 1). \"On July 31, 2016, based on the reports of the foreign government, the FBI opened an investigation into possible coordination between the Russian government and the individuals associated with the Trump campaign.\" This investigation became the investigation of Mueller &apos; s private lawyer after Trump fired FBI Director James Come. Deputy Attorney-General Rhode Rosenstein -- standing in the position of then Attorney-General Jeff hearings, who had stepped away from Russian matters -- was in the middle of the year. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman - January 11, 2012, it should be noted that Muller did not find any conspiracy with Russia; if Muller had been part of a coup, he could have directed the Ministry of Justice to the wind and accused Trump. What's a coup? The important point in this summary is that the investigation was carried out by law enforcement agencies and that it complied with the relevant laws. On the contrary, the specific element of the coup is that it is carried out outside the limits of legality. \"We define the coup as the sudden and irregular removal (i.e. illegal or illegal) of the executive branch of an independent government, or displacement thereof,\" wrote the Cobb Diet Project at the Klein Democracy Centre of the University of Illinois in 2013. Michael Clarman, professor at Harvard Law School, Poletti Fuckett said that the Russian investigation \"is not a coup, because the FBI has very good reasons to start an investigation in Trump. He is a beggar who believes that anyone in the FBI had the intention of undermining the duly elected President.\" Anthony Clarke Arnd, Professor of State and Foreign Service at Georgetown University, agreed. \"using the term \"coop,\" the President suggests that Mueller, and thus his Ministry of Justice, are acting outside the law,\" said Arend. However, Mueller \"was appointed and supervised by Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney-General of the President-designate.\" Of the 12 types of coups recognized by Klein, nine appear to have nothing to do with Tramp, including coups d &apos; \u00e9tat, rebel coups, popular uprisings, dissidents, coups d &apos; \u00e9tat, foreign coups, international mediation shifts, forced resignations and self-closures, in which the leader is arming other branches of the Government to consolidate power. There are two other types cited by the Centre: coup attempts (which try to fail) and coup conspiracies (which never reach the implementation stage). Any supposed coup against Trump would have represented an attempted coup, because he was still in office. But that doesn't mean that there was actually an attempted coup. \"As far as Russia's investigation began before Trump's election, and at a time when it was universally assumed that Hillary Clinton would be elected, it could not be an attempt to overthrow the American government,\" said Richard Paulette, historian of Columbia University. \"It was an attempt by the State to prevent the seizure of government by an intelligent or unknown Russian agent.\" The main author of the report of the Klein Center, the politician at the University of Illinois Peter F. Nardoli, agreed that the definition of Trump would not be appropriate. \"The large proportion of extrajudicial overthrow from the government involves violence,\" said Nardole. \"What happened with Trump was the mere emergence of a normal government procedure in accordance with the rule of law. It was a completely different kind of coup.\" Among the categories of Klein centre, Trump is supposed to refer to \"a hostile coup,\" defined as \"the elimination of a rapist by members of the former regime within a month of the initial coup.\" However, in the case of Trump, he did not take office through a coup d &apos; \u00e9tat (assessed duly by the Electoral Commission) and in fact started the supposed counter-choice before he actually won the presidency. So calling it a counter-retrovert is also a problem. \"I can't see in any way or in any way how this could be a coup d'\u00e9tat in any reasonable sense for the word,\" said Richard Neviu, Assistant Professor and Senior Researcher at Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs. \"We have a long historical legacy of holding our senior officials and representatives accountable for their conduct\" Our verdict, Trump, said Russia's investigation was a coup d'\u00e9tat. This was an attempt to overthrow the United States government.\" The Russian investigation resulted from an investigation into law enforcement in accordance with the rules. This is very different from the coup d &apos; \u00e9tat, the characteristic of which is that it occurs outside the legal system. It should also be noted that the original investigation began before Trump even took his oath, which means that he was not even qualified to overthrow him because of a coup d &apos; \u00e9tat.
