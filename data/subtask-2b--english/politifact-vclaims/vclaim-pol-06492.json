Richard Corcoran, who has been telling voters that the federal program is dangerous for its patients.\nSeveral PolitiFact Florida readers have sent in an email response from the Land O\u2019 Lakes Republican, who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and the Joint Legislative Budget Commission. In his reply, Corcoran decries the already high enrollment and expense of Medicaid, the joint state and federal health care program for the very poor, as a reason to not accept federal expansion money under the Affordable Care Act.\n\"Unfortunately, those Floridians belong to a troubled delivery system,\" Corcoran wrote. \"The largest national study, conducted by the University of Virginia, found that Medicaid patients were 97 percent more likely to die than those with private insurance. Expanding coverage through a health care program that delivers questionable care is not a public policy that Florida should embrace.\"\nSaying patients are twice as likely to die is an eye-opening statistic to cite when arguing against Medicaid, implying not only is the program delivering substandard care, it\u2019s actually bad for patients. We wondered if the federal plan was really to blame for such a high mortality rate.\nWhat we found is that if you\u2019re on Medicaid and you have surgery, the study Corcoran cited did say you are more likely to die -- but it\u2019s probably not because you\u2019re using Medicaid to pay for treatment.\nThe Virginia study\nThe University of Virginia study was published in 2010, and followed the patient outcomes of almost 900,000 major surgeries across the country. That\u2019s different than the Medicaid population as a whole. It also kept track of whether those patients had private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or no insurance at all. The eight researchers adjusted for patient health care and population variables like age, income, where they lived, the type of hospital they were in, what kind of operation they were having and more.\nThe results showed Medicaid patients were the most at-risk, and were 1.97 times more likely to die following a procedure than a patient with private insurance. That\u2019s where Corcoran got his percentage, although experts we talked to said it was misleading to use as a reference.\nMedicaid patients also were more likely to die after a procedure than Medicare patients (1.54 more than insured patients) and even the uninsured (1.74 times). Medicaid recipients also had the highest total costs and longest hospital stays, although mortality rates varied depending on a variety of factors.\nSo does that mean Medicaid is the culprit for the higher odds of patient deaths? Not at all, University of Virginia School of Medicine professor and cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Irving Kron (rhymes with \"phone\") told us. Kron was one of the researchers for the study.\nWhile it does adjust for socioeconomic factors, the study notes that if you\u2019re on Medicaid, you\u2019re probably suffering from a whole host of risk factors other categories of patients don\u2019t have, he said. Medicaid recipients are the poorest, least educated and sickest of all patients, and often don\u2019t seek medical help until conditions are at their worst.\nThose patients have the highest incidence of AIDS, depression, liver disease, neurologic disorders, psychoses and metastatic cancer, the study said.\n\"The reality is it\u2019s apples and oranges,\" Kron said. \"The problem with Medicaid is there\u2019s more emergencies, because they\u2019re sicker than most people. \u2026 They wait for care and unfortunately, emergent patients don\u2019t do as well as elective patients.\"\nKron said the study focused on whether socioeconomic status was a factor in medical treatment, which it clearly was, and not on the quality of the systems paying for health care. Corcoran insisted the study proved him right.\n\"My point was that Medicaid is a subpar health care delivery system,\" Corcoran said via email. \"The University of Virginia study supports that conclusion.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study does include a caveat that there is a possible \"system bias\" that gives privately insured people access to better hospitals and doctors. \"For many surgical patients, private insurance status often allows for referral to expert surgeons for their disease. Alternatively, Medicaid and uninsured patients may have been referred to less skilled and less specialized surgeons,\" the study said.\nBut Kron and health policy experts disagree with Corcoran\u2019s takeaway.\nLeighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research for the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, said Medicaid patients are a very broad category that is tough to compare to others, even the uninsured.\nEchoing Kron\u2019s concerns, he added that uninsured patients may elect to go without coverage and end up on Medicaid when they become sick, or that insured patients in the study may have reached lifetime policy limits and had to resort to Medicaid.\n\"As the researchers in the paper acknowledge, part of the reason that Medicaid is associated with higher mortality is that many people fall into Medicaid when they are very sick and impoverished,\" Ku said.\nOther reports\nCorcoran also directed us to a recent Oregon study that examined the difference between patients allowed to join expanded Medicaid rolls in a 2008 lottery versus others who did not get into the program.\nOver two years, the study found that while patients in the program initially reported feeling better, there was no real change in health indicators such as diabetes control, cholesterol or blood pressure. In essence, the research found Medicaid didn\u2019t really improve physiological health, although patients said they felt better.\nThat\u2019s probably because they didn\u2019t have to worry as much about getting treatment, Harvard health economist Ben Sommers said. People in the Oregon study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health. One thing it didn\u2019t say, which Corcoran originally argued with the Virginia study, was that Medicaid hurt its patients.\n\"In any accounting, there is no evidence of people being worse off for having gotten Medicaid. Getting Medicaid is a major improvement over being uninsured in these studies,\" Sommers said.\nSommers, who is a part-time adviser to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, helped research a report on the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine and New York. The team found patients in those states showed improved access to care, self-reported health and reduced mortality, compared to nearby states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid. Improvements were higher in minority and very low-income patients.\nHe added that there are other reports that compare different primary payer categories to each other, but there was no evidence of what Corcoran implied in his email -- that Medicaid itself was to blame for the higher mortality rate by providing substandard care.\n\"To my knowledge there are no studies that examine the impact of states\u2019 expanding Medicaid, or individuals going from uninsured to Medicaid, showing Medicaid to be harmful,\" Sommers said.\nOur ruling\nCorcoran said, \"Medicaid patients were 97 percent more likely to die than those with private insurance.\"\nCorcoran was citing a 2010 University of Virginia study that looked at Medicaid patients who underwent surgery, not all people in the program. Experts we spoke to --\u00a0including one of the study\u2019s authors --\u00a0said it\u2019s a misleading statistic to cite. While it\u2019s accurate to say Medicaid patients who undergo operations have\u00a0higher odds of dying\u00a0than those with private insurance, it\u2019s because they are sicker and tend to wait until the last minute for care, not because the program is inadequate. Other studies show using Medicaid improves access and quality of life for many patients, or at the very least doesn\u2019t hurt them.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06492"}
