Dr. John Gilliam explained in an interview with PolitiFact that \"minors can\u2019t consent to treatment, legally.\" Dr. Gilliam works in Oregon as a hospitalist, an in-patient physician who works exclusively in a hospital.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParental consent is still a requirement in New York hospitals, where the virus is spreading rapidly and the New York State Department of Health is introducing temporary new visitor policies. The University of Rochester Medical Center and the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital have both announced that recovering adults aren\u2019t allowed any visitors, but children are still allowed to have one guardian accompany them.\nIf your child does have COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC first recommends to not take them to the hospital unless they develop emergency warning signs, such as having trouble breathing or experiencing persistent pain or pressure in the chest. The CDC has published guidelines for treating healthy adults and children with COVID-19 symptoms at home. The CDC also doesn\u2019t consider children a high-risk group for COVID-19 and have found that children who have been confirmed to have the virus \"have generally presented with mild symptoms.\"\nIn the unlikely event that a child is hospitalized for complications from COVID-19, they will have a parent or another guardian by their side.
