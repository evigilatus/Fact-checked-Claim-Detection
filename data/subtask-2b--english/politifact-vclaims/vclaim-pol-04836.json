It is hundred of communities all over this country,\" he said. \"There are tens of thousands of homes right here in California where you turn on the faucet, but you can't drink the water.\"\n\"They have to bring in bottled water, and, by the way, at great expense,\" Sanders said. \"And if we do not act aggressively on fracking and other issues, this problem will only spread.\"\n(There was a moment of confusion during Sanders' comments when someone to Sanders' left injected a comment and, based on that, Sanders said it was tens of thousands just in that county. When we contacted that other person, environmental lawyer Gary Alan Patton, he told PolitiFact that he and Sanders misunderstood each other and the \"tens of thousands\" was not a county number.)\nFor this fact-check, we will look at whether Sanders correctly reported the scope of the problem in California as a whole.\nThe short answer: We couldn't find any clear data.\nThe federal Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 with a budget of over $9 billion \u2014 said it doesn't have a running tally of households or individuals in the United States or by state who can't drink their tap water.\nEPA referred us to California's EPA and its State Water Resources Control Board. They don't have a tally either.\nWhat the control board does have is an annual report covering 2014 with numbers that are only suggestive of the scope of the drinking water problem in California's 7,789 public water systems.\nIt focuses on the 167 water systems in the state that have had drinking water violations. The only time it counts people is in the sections that list water systems with arsenic, nitrate and nitrite contamination.\nBy our tally, in 2014, 168 water systems serving 158,354 residents were cited at least once for high arsenic concentration. An additional 124 systems serving 36,652 residents were cited for high concentrations of nitrate or nitrite, substances common in fertilizers.\nIn total, those water systems serve just over 195,000 people.\nWith an average household size of 2.58 people, that would be about 75,600 households, putting Sanders in the \"tens of thousands\" ballpark.\nThe problem is saying a water system has been cited for violations in 2014 doesn\u2019t mean those households don\u2019t have drinkable tap water.\nSome of those violations may have since been corrected.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of those water systems may have adjusted for the contamination.\nConsider contamination with arsenic, the legendary poison that, in small doses over a long period of time can cause diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The element usually comes from the erosion of natural deposits.\nWe contacted people in two of the largest systems cited for arsenic contamination.\nIn Arvin, Calif., the levels are so high, the 18,000 or so residents supplied by local water district are drinking bottled or filtered water provided by the city. The schools, parks and the library, for example, have their water filtered. The city is working on three new wells to try to correct the longstanding problem.\nYet a few miles northwest, in Lamont, which serves a population of 18,290, people are drinking the water in spite of one well with high arsenic levels. That well is shut down, so the tap water is drinkable. Water district officials are hoping a new well will have low levels so they can blend it with the now-offline well to dilute the arsenic. \"We never had a case where people had to purchase water because it was unsafe to drink,\" said Rolando Marquez, water system supervisor.\nPoint being, they shouldn't be included in any count to assess whether Sanders is correct.\nBut there's another factor that makes the state report even less reliable as a gauge of how many California residents have tap water that's not safe to drink.\nBetween 660,000 and 2 million people in the state rely on unregulated water from home wells that may also be polluted and don't have to be tested. People may be drinking it because the cost to homeowners to treat that water may be prohibitively high.\nThe only official estimate we could find for the state was a 2013 news release from the state water board reporting that, \"More than 95 percent of California\u2019s 38 million residents get their drinking water from a public water supply and, of that number, 98 percent are served safe drinking water, according to CDPH,\" the acronym for the California Department of Public Health.\nIf that means 2 percent are served unsafe drinking water, that works out to about 722,000 residents or roughly 280,000 households.\nThat's hundreds of thousands, not tens of thousands. If that estimate is correct, Sanders is low-balling the tap water pollution problem in The Golden State.\nWhen we contacted the Sanders campaign, they didn't have any hard numbers either, just media reports, including an Associated Press story about 2 million people living near groundwater containing uranium (but that's untreated water and the\u00a0number goes beyond California), another AP story reporting that 57 water systems in California had too much lead in their drinking water (but no indication on how many households they served) and a story from the Visalia Times Delta saying that nearly one fifth of groundwater used for public drinking supplies is polluted (again, that's before treatment).\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"There are tens of thousands of homes right here in California where you turn on the faucet, but you can't drink the water.\"\nBut surprisingly,\u00a0neither the federal nor state governments has a reliable tally for public water supplies, never mind private wells that are not regulated.\nClearly California has a lot of polluted water, but in many cases that water can be treated or mixed with unpolluted water to bring the contaminants down to safe levels. Thus, the number of households with undrinkable tap water remains uncertain.\nSanders is right about the problem but his assessment of its scope \u2014 tens of thousands of households \u2014 lacks good data.\nFor that reason, we rate it Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a0479acd-8a2a-47f7-9b7e-93ba460d5c1c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04836"}
