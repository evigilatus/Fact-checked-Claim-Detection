Few of his plans ever become law.\n\"(Ryan) has actually proposed three \u2014 total, three \u2014 bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999,\" David Canon was quoted as saying. \"Paul Ryan is not a detail kind of legislator in terms of putting bills together to pass, and he never has been.\n\"He is an ideas guy.\"\nWhen Ryan announced his endorsement of Trump, he wrote that the first step in setting policy agenda is \"putting it on paper and having a real debate.\"\nIn making his claim, Canon suggested Ryan doesn\u2019t follow his own advice \u2014 or hasn\u2019t had much success with it. Let\u2019s take a look.\nBills, bills, bills\nThe article listed three bills proposed by Ryan that became law:\n\"One named a post office in Wisconsin, a second changed taxes on arrows used by deer hunters, and the third, this year, established a $3 million presidential commission on \u2018evidence-based policy making.\u2019 \"\nA visit to Ryan\u2019s profile at Congress.gov shows \u2014 when filtered by \"Sponsored Legislation\" and \"Became Law\" \u2014 the same three bills referenced in the article.\nWhile Canon was quoted as saying Ryan proposed only three bills, he told us he was referring to bills \"sponsored\" by Ryan.\n\"Sponsoring a bill is very different than co-sponsoring a bill,\" Canon wrote in an email. \"Many bills that become law have a hundred or more cosponsors, so bill sponsorship is the meaningful indicator of the member of Congress who had primary influence on determining the content of a bill.\"\nAccording to Congress.gov, Ryan has sponsored 109 pieces of legislation and co-sponsored 1,067. Of those, 83 became law.\nNew York Times reporter Jackie Calmes said it was clear from their conversation that Canon was referencing sponsored bills, and the statement\u2019s context in the article reflects that.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ryan\u2019s camp challenged how Canon assessed Ryan\u2019s tenure.\n\"Any realistic look at (Ryan\u2019s) record will clearly show the claim that Paul has only passed three bills is objectively wrong,\" said spokesman Ian Martorana.\nHe references three particular items not included in the count, all of which Ryan helped write:\n\n\nMurray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013\n\n\nTrade Promotion Authority legislation in 2015\n\n\nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015, in which Ryan authored disability insurance reforms\n\n\nFor four years, Ryan also chaired the House Budget Committee, which wrote and passed a nonbinding resolution each year, Martorana said.\nJennifer Victor, a professor of political science at George Mason University and an expert on Congress, said while Ryan has only personally sponsored three bills that became law, bill passage is not necessarily a good indicator of effectiveness as a legislator.\n\"Some legislators may be very active in a policy area, but rarely see enactment,\" she wrote in an email. \"Think of someone who introduces many bills, perhaps symbolically, and they all die in committee or get voted down on the floor.\"\nWhile this legislator hasn\u2019t changed the law, he or she might have generated attention for a topic.\nMeasuring impact based only on the bills a lawmaker solely sponsors also introduces issues, Victor said. Early cosponsors can be heavily involved in the bill\u2019s content and committee chairs, while they don\u2019t necessarily write more bills, often serve as facilitators.\nA better indicator of effectiveness, Victor said, is a tool developed by two professors that measures a lawmaker relative to his or her peers.\nIt takes into account the content of a lawmaker\u2019s bills and how far the bills moved. Policy bills, for example, increase a lawmaker\u2019s score more than commemorative bills. But it only looks at solely sponsored bills, which does not necessarily give the full picture of a lawmaker\u2019s impact.\nBy this tool, Ryan comes off as more effective, though his effectiveness is below the benchmark expectation for all but one two-year period since 1999.\nThe expectation is calculated based on his party, tenure and specific committee and subcommittee positions he has held.\nOur rating\nCanon told the New York Times that Ryan \"has actually proposed three \u2014 total, three \u2014 bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999.\"\nCanon was referring to bills Ryan solely sponsored and is on target by that measure. But the claim suggests Ryan has been an unproductive lawmaker. Another tool out there provides a better view, but \u2014 like Canon \u2014 ignores legislation Ryan helped author but didn\u2019t solely sponsor.\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92a76b05-8d40-4be1-a98d-32bb0f903f19", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04503"}
