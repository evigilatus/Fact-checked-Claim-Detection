No, because the NRA came crashing down and said, \u2018Don\u2019t you dare do any restrictions on our guns around this country.\u2019\"\nA reader asked us to fact-check Gillibrand\u2019s statement. We found that Gillibrand\u2019s statement flagrantly disregarded the facts. Asked in the town hall about how to curb mass shootings, her answer was to attack \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 an instance in which Trump actually accomplished a goal that gun critics had sought, and where the administration directly disregarded the NRA, which had opposed an all-out ban.\nBump stocks are now illegal in the United States, and it\u2019s directly because of actions by the Trump administration. \"The senator is wrong,\" said Harold Corzine, a University of Central Florida sociologist who has studied gun policy.\nOnce the role of bump stocks in the Las Vegas shooting became clear, Trump said he\u2019d be open to banning the device. Just over two months after the Las Vegas shooting, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives began the formal regulatory process of reviewing whether bump stocks should be banned. Trump publicly reiterated his support on Feb. 20, 2018, signing a memorandum \"directing\" the attorney general to propose regulations to ban all such devices.\nThe final rule was published on Dec. 18, 2018, with acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker announcing that bump stocks \"fall within the definition of \u2018machine gun\u2019 under federal law, as such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.\"\nThe NRA issued a statement after the final rule saying that it opposed an outright ban and had asked for an amnesty period in the rule. Neither request became part of the regulation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Firearms Policy Coalition and individual pro-gun critics (but not the NRA) challenged the new rule in court, but the critics of the ban lost at the U.S. District Court level in February 2019. The following month, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, allowing the ban to go into effect.\nThe penalty for owning a bump stock is now up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine per violation.\nThe ATF has a web page on how to destroy bump stocks in a way that satisfies the new rules, and one major seller of bump stocks, RW Arms, turned over its remaining inventory to the ATF to be shredded on March 26, 2019.\n\nA shooting instructor demonstrates the grip on an AR-15 rifle fitted with a \"bump stock\" at a gun club in North Carolina in 2017. (AP)\nGroups that favor stronger gun laws applauded the move, though some criticized how long it took and the fact that the ban was done through the regulatory process rather than by a law passed by Congress.\nGillibrand\u2019s national press secretary Evan Lukaske said the senator was referring to the NRA\u2019s opposition to \u2014 and seeming ability to block \u2014 congressional legislation on bump stocks, and the 10-month lag between Trump\u2019s expression of openness until the final rule was published.\n\"Sen. Gillibrand acknowledges that five months after the Las Vegas shooting, President Trump issued a ban that was enacted in December 2018, much to the NRA's chagrin,\" Lukaske said. \"Her statement supports the larger point, that the NRA uses money and influence to control members of the Republican Party, and prevent common sense gun reforms that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support.\"\nSuch concerns, however, do not get at the point of her town hall remark. She left the strong impression that bump stocks are still legal, and that Trump went back on his word. Both assertions are flatly incorrect.\nOur ruling\nGillibrand said, \"Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, (President Donald Trump) said, \u2018Yeah, yeah, we\u2019re going to ban the bump stocks.\u2019 Did he ban the bump stocks? No.\"\nGillibrand\u2019s effort to turn Trump into a villain on bump stocks flies in the face of the facts. In reality, bump stocks were a rare area in which Trump accomplished a goal sought by gun critics, and his administration\u2019s rule was more forceful than what the NRA had sought. Thanks to the efforts of Trump and his administration, owning bump stocks is now a felony. We rate Gillibrand\u2019s statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00561"}
