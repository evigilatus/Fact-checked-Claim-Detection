The legislation also says it is not authorizing the use of \"armed forces in enduring offensive ground operations.\"\nIn something of an odd-bedfellows pairing, some hawkish Republicans prefer giving the president even wider leeway to go after the Islamic State, sometimes called ISIS or ISIL.\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., is among those who say Congress should ease restrictions from the proposal, known as an authorization for the use of military force.\n\"This would be the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief,\" Kinzinger said on the Feb. 15, 2015, edition of ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos. \"We don't own his limited strategy. The president has to make that decision, which is why I think he needs the broad power to do what the commander-in-chief does.\"\nRepublicans wanting to give Obama more power? That caught us by surprise. So we took a closer look at Kinzinger\u2019s statement.\nCongress, the presidency and war: A brief history\nMilitary historians we spoke with took umbrage with Kinzinger\u2019s statement, noting a longstanding tension between the legislative and the executive branches over military powers. In fact, the conflict goes back as far as the Founding Fathers.\nIn the Constitution, Congress was granted the power to declare war and raise and maintain an army and a navy. At the same time, the president was deemed commander-in-chief. Those two roles have competed for centuries.\nThe issue prompted a 1800 Supreme Court case, Bas vs. Tingy, in which the court distinguished between a declared war \u2014 a status that the court ruled grants sweeping powers to the president \u2014 and military action authorized by other legislative methods.\nEssentially, the decision said that \"in a declared war, the president's actions are unrestricted, except as restricted by the laws of war,\" said Anthony Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. By contrast, \"in a war declared by other statutory means, Congress can set limits.\"\nThe last time Congress declared war was World War II. Since then, military operations have been conducted through authorizations for the use of military force (and, in some instances, without congressional approval). Congress used those opportunities to impose limits on how the president could use force.\nFor example, the 1983 resolution that provided authority for President Ronald Reagan to send American troops to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon set a time limit of 18 months.\nThen, in 1991, Congress authorized the use military force to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait. But the agreement stipulated that President George H.W. Bush first had to show congressional leaders that he had used \"all appropriate diplomatic and other peaceful means to obtain compliance by Iraq with the United Nations Security Council.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd congressional intervention into the president\u2019s powers as commander-in-chief doesn\u2019t begin or end with authorizations. Other types of legislation have played a role as well.\nIn the 1930s, the Neutrality Acts limited President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s ability to aid allied nations fighting in World War II. In 1973, Congress passed a law to block any future military operations Southeast Asia unless Congress approved them, essentially ending the United States\u2019 engagement in the Vietnam War. Later, Congress rebuked President Gerald Ford\u2019s request for military aid to Vietnam.\nThe most significant and lasting Vietnam-era congressional response came in 1973, when Congress overrode President Richard Nixon\u2019s veto of the War Powers Resolution. The act required presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of sending troops into harm's way and mandated authorization from Congress if military force is to be used beyond 60 days.\nThe Supreme Court has never weighed in on the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution, but every president since it passed \"has taken the position that it is an unconstitutional infringement by Congress on the president\u2019s authority as commander in chief,\" the Congressional Research Service has written. Despite this, presidents have tended to abide by key aspects of the law for pragmatic reasons, hoping to appease Congress and present a united front before utilizing military force.\nFinally, Congress can use (and has used) the power of the purse to restrict the president\u2019s use of military force. For example, in 1993, Congress prohibited funding for a continuous presence of U.S. forces in Somalia.\nKinzinger\u2019s response\nWhen we took this to Kinzinger\u2019s office, spokeswoman Catherine Gatewood said the congressman \"was talking in the context of fighting terrorism and radical jihadism. In the current war, Congress has never taken a position to limit the president\u2019s ability to fight terrorism, so to do so in his fight against ISIS would be a change in policy.\"\nThe far more general nature of the statement suggests to us that this is an after-the-fact reinterpretation of his words. But even if we take it at face value, it\u2019s not clear to us that Kinzinger is accurate.\nHe has a point that the 2001 joint resolution that authorized the use of force against al-Qaida was quite broad. In fact, it didn\u2019t even name al-Qaida as the target, but rather gave the president the power to use force against \"nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.\" That\u2019s pretty open-ended.\nStill, even that resolution restricted the efforts to terrorist groups or countries directly or tangentially involved in the planning and execution of the 9/11 attacks. This limitation has at least forced debates on whether Obama needs authorization to continue military action in Syria against the Islamic State.\n\"It is a bit of a stretch to say (the 2001 authorization) covered ISIS, but you could make a case for that,\" said Richard Stoll, an expert on international conflict at Rice University. \"It is better if we\u2019re going to use military force to say, \u2018I, as president, may have the power to do this, but it is better if Congress approves it, because it tells the world we stand together.\u2019 \"\nAnd it is not as though Congress has been absent from the debate on anti-terrorism strategy. For example, President George W. Bush in 2006 signed legislation passed by Congress to outlaw use of torture against terrorism suspects who were sent to Guantanamo Bay.\n\"A lot of the action, when you think about congressional checks on war powers, happens behind closed doors,\" said William Howell, an American politics professor at the University of Chicago and author of While Dangers Gather: Congressional Checks on Presidential War Powers. \"There are things Obama and Bush might very well like to do that neither of them followed up on, assuming Congress would intervene and make life difficult for them. When you think about Congress as a player on debates on war, it\u2019s not just resolutions and legislation; a lot of this stuff is anticipatory.\"\nOur ruling\nKinzinger said that the authorization for use of military force now pending in Congress would represent \"the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief.\"\nA plain reading of that statement finds it problematic. Time and time again, Congress has intervened to rein in presidents from taking certain types of actions or continuing combat longer than lawmakers want. To do this, Congress simply has to use the power it is granted in the Constitution, authority that has been affirmed and reaffirmed by courts for centuries.\nEven the narrower interpretation of the statement that Kinzinger\u2019s office stands by \u2014 that it only refers to the war on terrorism \u00a0\u2014 doesn\u2019t hold up. We rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06713"}
