But Chicago has more guns on the streets, Mayor Rahm Emanuel told CNN.\nThat was his answer when CNN host Jake Tapper asked on April 2, 2013: With some of the nation\u2019s strictest gun laws, why are your homicide rates still so high?\nWithout uniform gun policies \u2014 say, in neighboring Indiana and Wisconsin \u2014 weapons still flow, Emanuel said.\n\"We take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.,\" he said.\nEmanuel, who formerly was President Barack Obama's\u00a0 White House chief of staff, is part of a group of mayors that\u2019s fighting for stricter national gun laws.\nWe were curious: Does America\u2019s No. 3 most populous city take No. 1 in gun seizures?\nChicago\u2019s guns\nWe talked with Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman in Emanuel\u2019s office. He said the city uses the comparison with New York and Los Angeles to demonstrate that Chicago\u2019s strict gun control rules won\u2019t work by themselves.\n(Opponents of gun control measures argue the city offers evidence that such laws don\u2019t work, period.)\nNew York and California both have stricter gun control laws than Illinois. Guns cross into Chicago not just from Indiana and Wisconsin, but from areas right outside the city.\n\"Chicago is not an island,\" McCaffrey said.\nIn the first six months of last year, the city \u2014 not counting gun buybacks or turn-ins \u2014 seized 3,912 guns. That\u2019s as many as New York and Los Angeles combined, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab, which got numbers from the cities\u2019 police departments.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Chicago, police picked up illegal weapons at crime scenes and traffic stops, found them with search warrants and investigations, or heard about them when people called 911 to report a \"man with a gun\" or \"shots fired.\"\nIn the same months that Chicago recovered 3,912 guns, Los Angeles got 2,296 and New York 1,385.\nThat wasn\u2019t an anomaly, according to Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has testified before Congress in favor of strengthening federal measures to reduce gun trafficking.\nFor several years under the Clinton administration, an effort to fight youth crime collected gun-tracing data for major U.S. cities.\n\"I can tell you that Chicago consistently recovered more guns than any of the other cities, N.Y.C. and L.A. included,\" Webster said.\nWe pulled those reports from 1998, 1999 and 2000. Chicago recovered and traced more guns than either New York or Los Angeles in all three years. In 1998, it picked up 16,222 weapons \u2014 more than the two larger cities together.\nWhy?\nWebster points out that the city has a lot of gangs, and gangs and guns go together. Its police department cracks down on illegal gun possession, making arrests more likely. And Illinois gun control laws aren\u2019t nearly as strong as those in New York and California in deterring gun trafficking into the city, he said.\nWebster told House Democrats in March that studies show state gun laws are undermined by gaps in federal law \u2014 people buy guns in states with the weakest laws to sell in states with the toughest laws.\nThe same idea works for counties and cities.\nIn Chicago, all it takes is a drive outside the city limits, the New York Times reported, such as to Chuck\u2019s Gun Shop in Riverdale, Ill., the source of more than 1,300 weapons seized in Chicago since 2008.\nThe same store was identified as a key source of crime guns in a New York Times piece in 1999.\nOur ruling\nEmanuel, arguing for stronger federal laws to help Chicago tamp down on gun crime, said, \"we take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.\" Gun seizure data gathered by the University of Chicago Crime Lab and a federal youth crime initiative show just that.
