If a person returned multiple ballots, the system would flag it as a duplicate vote and only one would be counted.\nAllegheny County erroneously sent some residents multiple mail-in ballots ahead of the state\u2019s primary election on June 2, according to news reports. The incident was included in a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, which claims that election officials in Pennsylvania have implemented a fraudulent mail voting system that will undermine the results of the general election on Nov. 3.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

But the labels were actually still printing, so when the system rebooted, some printed twice, the release said.\nThe county said it was going to start printing labels in smaller batches to prevent the error from occurring again, and that affected residents should destroy any duplicate ballots.\n\"Even if a person receives multiple ballots, only one return ballot can be counted. This is because the barcode on the label that is being used for tracking is exactly the same,\" the release noted.\u00a0\n\"When voted ballots are returned to the office, they are scanned. If another ballot was returned from that same voter, it would show as a duplicate vote when scanned and would be rejected by the system. Staff would mark the ballot as rejected. Those ballots are kept but are not sent to the warehouse to be counted or opened.\"\nOur ruling\nAn image appears to show two mail-in ballots addressed to one Pennsylvania resident, suggesting this means they could vote twice.\nIt\u2019s accurate that a group of residents in Allegheny County, Pa., received duplicate mail ballots due to a computer glitch ahead of the state\u2019s primary election in June, and the photo in the post appears to show an example of the error.\nBut it\u2019s wrong to suggest that this means they can cast multiple votes. The system uses one barcode for each voter. If a duplicate is scanned, election officials would mark the ballot as rejected.\nWe rate this Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17202"}
