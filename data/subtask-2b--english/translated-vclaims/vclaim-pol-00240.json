This is what one Facebook post claims. The entire article says: \"Thank Obama, it is perfectly legal for the media to deliberately lie to the American people. Law HR 4310 was quietly signed in 2012, which allows the use of propaganda against citizens of the United States of America by its Government, essentially repealing the Smith-Mandt Act of 1948, which prohibits the use of local propaganda.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, Obama didn't make it legal for publicity to run a choir in the newsrooms in the United States and to be presented as a fact in programs and reports to the American public. However, a bill was passed as part of H.R. The Smith-Mondt Modernization Act 2012 instead reflected restrictions on news programmes funded by the United States Government. Let's break this. First, Obama did not sign \"quietly\" on H.R. 4310, also known as the National Defence Licensing Act, becomes a law as proposed by the Mimi. He issued a statement on his passage and on some provisions which he did not agree to, although he did not include the Smith-Mondt update bill as part of his objections. So what did the legislation actually do? (HR) The Smith-Mondt Modernization Act 2012 H.R. 4310, also known as the National Defence Authorization Act, the Pentagon authorized funding up to fiscal year 2013. As part of H.R. The Smith-Mondt Modernization Act 2012 also approved and removed restrictions on programmes produced by the United States World Media Agency, formerly known as the Governor &apos; s Broadcasting Council, and the United States Government broadcast arm. Some of these programmes include Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Radio Middle East. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" For example, \"the voice of America\" says that it broadcasts \"precise, balanced and comprehensive reports, programmes, content on the Internet and social media of a global audience, especially those who are denied access to open and free media,\" and sets out the standards laid down by the VOA Press Code. The site states: \"The fundamental guarantee of the journalistic credibility of the sound of America is the firewall embodied in the 1994 United States International Broadcasting Act.\" \"The firewall prevents interference by any United States government official in the objective, independent news reports, thereby protecting our journalists' ability to develop content that reflects the highest professional standards of the press, free from political interference.\" Before the adoption of the law, programmes could only be seen or heard through the quality of broadcasting in foreign countries. The draft law removed restrictions on local distribution. In a recent foreign policy report, a news organization covering world affairs, I explained in detail what the bill had done, along with why government officials said it had been approved: \"A former government source in the United States, with the Board of Governors knowing that the organization is not a ravisher, but that it promotes the interests of the United States in more subtle ways. In Somalia, for example, the Somali People &apos; s Army (SPA) acts as counter-programming against outlets that sell anti-United States or anti-jihadist sentiment. According to the source, \"Somalis has three news options,\" \"oral word, youth, or VOA Somalia.\" This partly explains why BBG is allowed to broadcast on local radio stations in the United States. The Agency wishes to reach out to diaspora communities, such as St. Paul, an important Somali external community in Minnesota. The source said: \"These people have access to young people, they have access to Russia today, but they have not been able to access tax-funded news sources such as VOA Somalia.\" Lynne added that reform was also beneficial in terms of transparency. She said: \"Now Americans will be able to learn more about what they pay in their tax dollars - greater transparency is a gain for all concerned.\" The restrictions on United States funding have been removed and broadcast content generated in the country. In the context, it is important to note that the article may appear to have changed the country &apos; s defamation laws. But that's not true either. Defamation laws vary from state to state, and there is no federal defamation law. Our Facebook article claims that Obama made it legal for the media to \"deliberately lie to the American people\" when he signed H.R. 4310 became law in 2012, \"the use of propaganda against citizens of the United States of America is permitted by its Government, and essentially repeals the Smith Mundt Act of 1948, which prohibits the use of local propaganda.\" Obama signed H.R. 4310 became law, as well as the enactment of the Smith-Mondt Modernization Act 2012. However, the draft law did not make it lawful for independent media in the private sector to present to the public completely false information. Instead, government-sponsored news such as the American voice was allowed to broadcast in the United States. The restrictions on United States news have been removed from its presentation to the American public. The claim is not accurate. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00240"}
