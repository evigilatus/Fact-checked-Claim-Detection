Other residents complained that the man\u2019s open carrying made them feel \"uncomfortable\" and \"unsafe.\"\nThe story declared \"tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil\" and that \"a citizen\u2019s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.\"\nSounds alarming. But it\u2019s not accurate.\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found that the headline was wrong and that the story failed to explain that police obtained a warrant from a judge after the 31-year-old man failed to turn over his gun and appear at a hearing, as ordered by the court.\n\u2018Red Flag\u2019 laws in Washington and other states\nIn 2016, Washington state voters overwhelmingly approved Initiative 1491 to allow courts, upon petition by police or a family or household member, to issue an extreme risk protection order. The order prevents an individual from accessing firearms for a specified time period if the court determines the person poses a significant danger.\nA handful of other states, including California, have similar \"red flag\" laws, and many other states are considering passing them. Following the Parkland shooting, Florida passed such a law to allow law enforcement to seek a risk protection order.\nWhile the NRA argues the laws violate a person\u2019s rights by taking away a gun when no crime has been committed, law enforcement argues it is a tool they can use to take away a gun before a catastrophe occurs.\nDetails about the Seattle police seizing a man\u2019s handgun\nPolitiFact interviewed Sgt. Eric Pisconski, who heads up the unit that oversees extreme risk protection orders, as well as Seattle police spokesman Det. Patrick Michaud.\nPolice did not released the suspect\u2019s name. PolitiFact submitted records requests to the King County prosecutor and obtained the criminal complaint that explains the charge against Alexander Sinclair McKenzie, an Army veteran with post traumatic stress disorder.\nPolice said they had received multiple calls about McKenzie\u2019s escalating behavior in the past year.\nMcKenzie voluntarily surrendered a gun in 2017 after he was served with an anti-harassment order, even though he wasn\u2019t required to do so. He acknowledged he was experiencing \"stress\" and did not want the gun around, Michaud said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonths later, McKenzie, who lives above a restaurant, had several interactions with the restaurant staff. In one instance, he stood in front of the restaurant and yelled obscenities and accused people of talking to him through the floor.\n\"No crimes were committed at that time, but his behavior was erratic and unnerving to all; resulting in contact\" by police, Michaud said.\nMcKenzie declined services, but shortly thereafter he called police again to report \"taunting and voices\" coming from the restaurant below through the floor.\nHe also told police that he was armed with a gun and wanted a female employee \"arrested or shot\" by police, Michaud said.\nMcKenzie was ultimately taken to a medical facility.\nOn Feb. 13, police petitioned the court to get an extreme risk protection order to take away McKenzie\u2019s gun. A King County Superior Court Judge approved the order and police served it to McKenzie in person at a medical facility.\nHe agreed to call police when he was discharged to hand over the firearm. After he left the medical facility on Feb. 23, police attempted to contact McKenzie multiple times to obtain his firearm.\nAfter McKenzie didn\u2019t show up for his Feb. 27 court date about the order to turn over his gun, the judge granted a search warrant based on probable cause to arrest. McKenzie was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a person prohibited by extreme risk protection order, a gross misdemeanor.\nOn March 1, police went to McKenzie\u2019s apartment and took his gun. He was placed into custody and booked at the King County jail. The case remains pending.\nPisconski said that since the law went into effect in 2017, Seattle police have received 16 extreme risk protection orders that resulted in collecting about 26 guns. This was the only case in which the suspect didn\u2019t voluntarily surrender a gun.\nOne of the websites that wrote that police took the gun without a \"warrant\" added an editor\u2019s note about errors in its original article. The SHFTplan website, which has the tagline \"when it hits the fan, don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you,\" updated the article to state that law enforcement did have a warrant.\nOur ruling\nLiberty Headlines said, \"Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges.\"\nThe headline and the story make it appear that Seattle police arbitrarily took away a man\u2019s gun, and that\u2019s not the case.\nInterviews with police officials showed that after police received numerous reports about a man\u2019s troubling behavior, so they sought an extreme risk protection order from the court to remove the man\u2019s gun. Police tracked down the man to inform him about the order.\nWhen the man failed to appear in court as ordered and didn\u2019t turn over his gun, the judge signed off on the order that allowed police to arrest McKenzie.\nWe rate this claim False.\n'\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4e3adffd-1406-487d-98b7-294529c1674a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02310"}
