One point of contention is that the budget he proposed will reduce the army to its smallest size since 1940.\nOn CBS\u2019 Face the Nation on Sunday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told host Bob Schieffer that he\u2019s not responsible for those cuts.\n\"It isn\u2019t me cutting the budget,\" he said. \"It\u2019s the Congress\u2019 decision on sequestration. So it isn\u2019t the secretary of defense or the president doing this, and I think we should clear that up a little bit here, too.\"\nAt first glance, Hagel attributing defense cuts to Congress contradicts Obama\u2019s proposed budget, which itself cuts Department of Defense funding levels. PolitiFact wanted to review how the cuts came to be, and how that affects the defense budget.\nHow the sequester came to be\nCongress passed the Budget Control Act in August 2011 to resolve the debt ceiling crisis. Republicans and some Democrats insisted that the Obama administration offset an increase in the debt ceiling, the amount of money the treasury can borrow, with a plan to reduce the nation\u2019s debt. Had Congress not passed this law, the United States could\u2019ve defaulted on payments like Social Security and Medicare for the first time in history.\nThe Budget Control Act included $1.2 trillion in cuts and formed a joint House and Senate super-committee to find another $1.2 trillion by Nov. 23, 2011.\nSince the super-committee failed to do this, the law called for sequestration, or across-the-board spending cuts, to go into effect in 2013. Each year, budget cuts are split evenly between non-war defense spending and discretionary domestic spending.\nLawmakers in both chambers passed this act with bipartisan support, and then Obama signed it into law.\nWe\u2019ve reported before that the Obama administration originally proposed the sequester as a tactic to get Congress to come up with more targeted spending cuts. Since both Democrats and Republicans stood to lose funding for things they supported, it was widely thought that they would work out a deficit reduction and stop the sequester before 2013. Essentially, Congress and Obama both approved a measure they\u2019re now unhappy with and forced to work around.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s always entertaining to me to see everyone trying to run away from (the sequester),\" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget studies senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. \"Everyone agreed to it except for the Pentagon.\"\nHow Obama pushed back against the sequester\nThe White House and Congress jointly established the sequester in 2011. But as Harrison noted, there\u2019s a contradiction here. Recently, both groups have taken some action to exceed the sequester\u2019s cap on defense spending.\nThe budget caps for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 were set in December with a bipartisan budget agreement from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that rolled back the sequester in favor of more specific cuts. The 2015 defense spending cap was set at $496 billion, about $7 billion more than the sequester would have allocated. The Ryan-Murray deal left it up to Congress and the Department of Defense to determine how the cuts would be distributed.\nAgain, this bill had support on both sides of the aisle. Obama signed it into law Dec. 26.\nObama\u2019s 2015 main defense budget proposal doesn\u2019t exceed the $496 billion approved defense spending cuts he and Congress set up. However, he also proposed giving the Pentagon an extra $26.4 billion as part of a separate budget package, a $56 billion, paid-for investment fund called the Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative. He proposed giving the Department of Defense funds for weapon systems modernization, readiness restoration and facilities improvement.\nIn fiscal year 2014, the Department of Defense effectively didn\u2019t see any cuts because funding above the cap was moved to the war budget, a separate fund for Afghanistan, Harrison said. The White House hasn\u2019t yet proposed a 2015 war budget, because that\u2019s dependent on how many troops will stay overseas.\nObama\u2019s 2014 and 2015 proposals show that his ideal figure for defense spending is higher than what the sequester caps allow for. That said, since 2011, Obama\u2019s defense proposal figures have come down slightly, while the Budget Control Act\u2019s have come up. So although the Obama administration wants defense spending to exceed the caps, he\u2019s not necessarily advocating for pre-sequester level spending.\nOur ruling\nHagel said it wasn\u2019t he or Obama that made defense cuts, it was Congress in passing the sequester. Hagel himself wasn\u2019t working in government at the time, so he has no tie to the cuts.\nObama literally signed Congress\u2019 defense cuts into law in both 2011 and 2013. At the same time, his budgets have proposed funding defense spending at a level above what the caps call for, showing that he doesn\u2019t fully support the very agreements he signed.\nHagel\u2019s claim omits two instances where Obama supported defense spending cuts on record.
