Translated to English, the post is titled: \"Aninha is very much in need of your help.\" It goes on to say that the girl, Aninha, was diagnosed with leukemia and undergoing chemotherapy in Curitiba, the capital of the Brazilian state Paran\u00e1. It asks people to donate blood at a hospital there to help her. It doesn\u2019t ask for money.\u00a0\nThis Facebook post isn\u2019t the first to claim that sharing a photo of an ailing child will result in a cash flow. In December, we rated Pants on Fire a claim that Facebook would donate a dollar every time someone shared a photograph of a sick boy.\u00a0\nThis Facebook post gets the same rating.
