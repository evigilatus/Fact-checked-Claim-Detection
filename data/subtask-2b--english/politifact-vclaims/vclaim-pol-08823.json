If that happened, he said, some of the state\u2019s signature landscapes, such as Providence\u2019s Waterplace Park and North Kingstown\u2019s Wickford Village could be very different -- and smaller -- \u00a0by 2100.\n\"The upper end of that range is now looking like, more like, six feet,\" Fugate said. \"Waterplace Park would essentially be gone \u2026 you look at places like Wickford, so the historic district in Wickford, a lot of that would be lost.\"\nWaterplace Pond instead of Waterplace Park? Wickford swamped? Was that a deep thought or shallow reasoning? We decided to wade in.\nFriday\u2019s report from the climate panel is just the latest of numerous reports and studies of the effect of climate change on sea levels.\nIn December 2012, \u00a0the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Department of Defense\u2019s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and the Army Corps of Engineers prepared a report called \"Global Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States National Climate Assessment.\" \u00a0\nThe report said that an increasing number of studies have shown satellite measurements indicating polar ice, mostly from Greenland in the north and western Antarctica in the south, has been melting more rapidly than was previously thought, in turn making sea levels rise faster and higher than past projections. \u00a0\nThe NOAA report warned the melting would increase sea levels, but the range it gave was higher than that described in Friday\u2019s IPCC report.\n\"We have a very high confidence (a better than nine in ten chance) that global mean sea level will rise at least 0.2 meters (8 inches) and no more than 2 meters (6.6 feet) by 2100,\" \u00a0the 2012 multi-agency assessment said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFugate said it was that \"upper end\" -- up to 6.6 feet -- that he was referencing.\nThe University of Rhode Island\u2019s Graduate School of Oceanography\u2019s Sea Grant program has been interested in rising sea levels too. The program works with the state\u2019s coastal municipalities to anticipate where sea levels may rise and how to cope with it.\nJon Reiner, town planner in North Kingstown, said the Sea Grant staffers have analyzed what would happen in his community with the kind of sea-level rises Fugate cited. He said their analyses confirmed Fugate\u2019s warning.\nA 6-foot sea level increase, Reiner said, would inundate more than 150 parcels of land in the Wickford area, as much as 5 percent of the town. Teresa Crean, a planner with the URI Sea Grant program, said the value of that lost land was about $80 million.\nIn Providence, the effects of rising sea levels can be seen on a website of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that shows the foot-by-foot effects of rising sea levels. The interactive map doesn\u2019t include storm surges or runoff, only what increases in sea level would do.\nAccording to NOAA, \u00a0a 6-foot rise in sea level would submerge the walkway around the Waterplace Park pool and enough water would flow through the tunnel under Memorial Boulevard to put the Capital Grille and Bar Louie on their own waterfront.\nBut according to the NOAA, Waterplace Park might be the least of the city\u2019s worries. Even more vulnerable are the wharfs off Allens Avenue in the area between Sassafras Point and Henderson Street. Parts of the newly cleared Route 195 redevelopment area would flood, as well as the neighborhood around the Providence District Court Building.\nOur ruling\nGrover Fugate said Providence\u2019s Waterplace Park and Wickford village would be flooded if sea levels rose six feet, \"the upper end\" of some climate change estimates.\nWhile Fugate\u2019s high-end figure is double the estimate of the Intergovernmental Climate Change Committee, he was accurately quoting a figure that has been cited by four U.S. \u00a0agencies that deal with oceans and climate.\nAnd federal, state and local planners and agencies agree that a six-foot rise would swamp significant locations in Providence, Wickford and elsewhere in coastal Rhode Island, as Fugate said it would.\nWe find his statement True", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08823"}
