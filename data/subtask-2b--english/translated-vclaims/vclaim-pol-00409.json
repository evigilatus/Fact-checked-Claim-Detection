Trump used the line in a gathering in North Carolina and repeated it in the event of July 19 to mark the first time a man walked on the moon. On July 23, at the Washington meeting of conservative high school students, he dropped it again. \"Our country and our people have called garbage,\" said Trump July 23. The White House employees Hogan Gedley and Stephen Miller stood by the line in interviews on Fox News, as Fox News did the host of Jeanine Biraud and Sean Hannetti. This mangals is what Okasio Cortez said. This is the full context of her 9 March 2019, a conversation in the south by the southwest festival where she used the word \"waste.\" It was asked why candidates would take a period of time to pay for the minimum wage of $15 and to achieve objectives such as the new green agreement. Okasio Cortez responded with a story about a conversation with Trump's voter in her area. \"I'll never forget this big woman who came to me and said, \"You know, I've always voted for Democrats because my dad told me that Democrats are fighting for the working man and we stopped. And what I think we've seen is that both sides have expressly waived their responsibility. \"No one was fighting for the working people who were struggling and, as a result, almost created this opportunity. And you can take all this anger and turn it to a negative and devastating end that allows a small group of people to benefit from a large amount. \"Or you have to take a really bold stand to make it the other way and direct it to the possibility of what we can achieve together. On January 13, 2021, General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use Marines for security, saying, \"We don't work for you.\" By Samantha Butterman on January 17, 2021 \"I think the hard thing for people to see sometimes is that when we're on this road of slow erosion and slow movement away from what we've always been, we'll be hundreds of miles away -- you won't even realize that you've drifted hundreds of miles. So when someone talks about our son, it's like, \"Oh, that's radical.\" \"But that's not radical. That's what we've always been. \"The thing is that we are now far away from what really made us strong, just, good, equitable and productive. So I think all of these things seem radical compared to what we are, but where we are isn't a good thing. And the idea of 10% better than garbage shouldn't be what we're settling on.\" The host of Sunday Fox News Chris Wallace went back and forth with Miller on the full context of the quote. \"She talks about politics,\" said Wallace. \"She says her starting point.\" Miller interferes. \"She's not talking about the country and the people,\" Wallace's followers. \"Is garbage a terrible word?\" \"She says that America now thinks it's garbage,\" said Miller. Wallace pointed out that Trump himself had used a similar turn of words to criticize President Barack Obama. In 2014, Trump tweeted: \"The U.S., led by President Obama, really became \"the gang that couldn't shoot directly.\" Our rule, Trump, has confirmed that Okasio Cortez called the country and its people \"waste.\" In this context, she was talking about defending working men and women, specifically the voters in Trump. At no time did the United States or the United States call them \"waste.\" The word was used to describe a situation that left the workers behind. The Trump line turns its words upside down.
