He\u2019s spent ALMOST NONE of it. 6%. How about spending the money you have first?\u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 23, 2018\n\nHowever, the 6 percent figure isn\u2019t the only way to look at this question \u2014 nor is it necessarily the best one, experts say.\nThe accuracy of Murphy\u2019s statement boils down to how to measure federal outlays.\nWhen Congress passes spending bills, it gives that money to a federal agency. The agency, in turn, does the preparatory work to get a particular project accomplished.\nSo do you count it only when a check is cut to a vendor? Or do you measure it when the money is obligated for a specific use -- by signing a contract, for instance?\nAs it turns out, the choice of measurement makes a big difference.\nWhere the figure came from\nThe 6 percent figure first emerged from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee. (Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker awarded his statement Three Pinocchios.)\nLeahy\u2019s minority staff issued a news release Dec. 10 that said in part, \"Over the last two years, Congress has provided nearly $1.7 billion to build or replace fencing on the southern border, but the administration has hardly spent any of that money, and the projects it has undertaken have ballooned in cost. So far, only 6 percent of those funds have been spent. Six.\" (For emphasis, the news release put \"Six\" in bold type.)\nAccording to the committee, Customs and Border Protection reported in late November that the total enacted funds for this purpose in 2017 and 2018 were $1,716,066,065. Of that, $1,602,675,723 was obligated, and $108,695,342 was formally spent.\nSo, expenditures did amount to about 6 percent of the funds that Congress enacted, as Leahy\u2019s news release said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you use the other data point, about 93 percent of those funds were obligated. Consider this analogy: You go to the dry cleaners and bring in a couple of suits. By handing over the suits to the cleaner, you\u2019ve committed to paying the cost, even if you haven\u2019t forked over the money yet.\nSteve Ellis, a veteran federal budget expert with the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact that obligations are a better measurement with construction funds.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you should run with the 93 percent number, either.\nA U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman told PolitiFact that 60 percent of the funds have gone so far as to reach the \"contract award\" stage. This means that \"a vendor begins work on the border wall, beginning with design and followed by construction,\" said spokesman Andrew Meehan. Expenditures happen at a later stage, when a contractor bills the government after the work has been completed, he said.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the projects, according to the agency:\n\u2022 The fiscal year 2017 enacted appropriations provided $341 million to construct 40 miles of replacement primary pedestrian wall and vehicle barriers in multiple locations across the southwest border. So far, the Army Corps of Engineers has placed nearly $300 million on contracts, and as of Dec. 21, 2018, had completed work on 35 of those 40 miles.\n\u2022 The fiscal year 2018 enacted appropriations provided $1.375 billion to construct about 82 miles of new and replacement border barriers in multiple locations across the southwest border.\nBetween March and July 2018, approximately $1.2 billion had been obligated to the Army Corps of Engineers for construction, real estate acquisition, and program management. And by Dec. 31, 2018, the Corps had a little less than $700 million under contract for construction of new and replacement wall system in the Rio Grande Valley, Tucson, Yuma, El Centro and San Diego sectors. An additional $300 million or so is ready to award when the government reopens.\nLeahy\u2019s office stood by its initial 6 percent calculation, telling PolitiFact, \"The fact is that as of the end of November, only 6 percent of the funds appropriated by Congress for physical barriers along the southern border over the last two years has actually been spent.\"\nMurphy\u2019s office also stood by Leahy\u2019s calculation.\nOur ruling\nMurphy tweeted, \"The 2017/2018 budgets gave (President Donald) Trump billions for border upgrades. He\u2019s spent ALMOST NONE of it. 6%.\"\nThis is a misleading talking point that makes it sound as if Trump\u2019s administration is dawdling on the border wall at the center of the government funding dispute.\nThe 6 percent figure refers to actual checks that have been cut. But at this early stage of a multi-year construction project, the more relevant figure is how much money has been committed under contract. That\u2019s about 60 percent \u2014 10 times the figure that Murphy and other Democrats have used.\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01160"}
