Scott Walker - During an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio on 29 September 2014. Two and a half minutes later, Burke Walker was torn apart because of the number of jobs he created in the three and a half years in which he took office. She then put a new course on what was the main theme of her campaign. Honestly, things didn't get better. Burke told the host Joey Cardin. \"The longer he takes office, the worse things go.\" She went on to say: \"In 2013, job creation was worse than in 2012, which is worse than in 2011. And 2014 is forming into the worst year ever, with the loss of 4,300 jobs in August alone.\" This allegation was repeated by Burke, most recently on 6 October 2014, in an interview in Postcrist.com. In January 2014, we assessed a very similar false allegation by the State Republic of Brett Holsey (D-Madison), who failed to apply for the nomination of the Democratic Governor. But that was months ago and the numbers are subject to change. Is Burke's claim better than that? In one word: no. When Burke asked for support, Burke Joe Zepke's spokesperson basically reiterated the candidate's claim: \"The longer he takes office, the worse it will be, 2013 will be worse than 2011 and 2012. 2014 is at a pace to be the worst year of job creation so far.\" But he didn't repeat it exactly. Burke said that every year was less than last year, like walking down the stairs. Only Zepici said that 2013 was worse than 2011 and 2012. As a support, Zepici reported figures for only two years: 33,872 in 2012 and 29,723 in 2013. It's okay, we've done this account before, and here's what I've shown in terms of the jobs added each year: on January 9, 2021, Sarah Goodlowski said on Twitter: \"Not all women lost jobs (in the December job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women have gained employment.\" This is not a series of steps down, but a step up and a step down. The figures are derived from the calculation of the quarterly jobs of the United States Labour Statistics Office. It is derived from surveys of almost all employers in the State and is considered to be the most accurate method of counting jobs. The Burke observation that 2014 is about to be the worst of all is based on monthly figures for BLS jobs, which are subject to a much broader probability. To date, as of August 2014, these figures show that the State added 8,800 jobs in 2014. That doesn't sound very good. However, the eight-month limit was not always the same as the annual total. In 2011, eight months later, the State added a total of 900 jobs for the year, according to monthly estimates. The final total for the year, based on more accurate census figures, was 29,800. In 2012, there was a similar pattern -- minus 500 jobs after eight months, but at the end of the year the total was 33,872. In 2013, growth was lower. There were an estimated 26,210 posts after eight months, with a total of 29,723 at the end of the year. We followed Walker &apos; s promise in 2010 to create 250,000 jobs in the private sector during his four-year term in Walk-O-Meter. Based on the underdeveloped numbers and the waning time, we evaluated the broken promise. You can see a monthly update to track job performance in the state since Walker took office here. Our assessment says Burke that job creation gets worse every year that Scott Walker was a ruler. According to the data, this is not the case - it was up and down performance. Employers continued to add jobs, although not at a strong pace. We're assessing the allegation wrong.
