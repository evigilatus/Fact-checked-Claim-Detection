The New York Times reported that a second intelligence agency review found Top Secret material in emails Clinton received on her personal account.\nThe majority view on Fox News\u2019 The Five was that this proved that Clinton played fast and loose with very classified information and broke the Obama administration\u2019s rules. The lone dissenting voice was Juan Williams, who argued that Clinton had the right to exercise her own judgment about how sensitive the material was.\n\"When it comes to 'classified' at the State Department, she\u2019s the decider,\" Williams said.\nThis drew a chorus of you are so wrongs from the rest of the panel. We thought we\u2019d try to sort out whether the secretary of state is the \"decider,\" as Williams put it.\nWilliams\u2019 assertion is not as out-of-bounds as his fellow panelists on The Five let on.\nClinton, as the head of the State Department, has the authority to classify information. The power is spelled out in President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order on national security information. It reads:\nThe authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by:\n(1) \u00a0the President and the Vice President;\n(2) \u00a0agency heads and officials designated by the President; and\n(3) \u00a0United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.\nThe executive order goes on to say that an agency head, such as Clinton, can designate a deputy to oversee the classification process. The State Department\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual spells things out a little further, saying that \"those occupying various positions in the Department and at posts abroad have the authority to classify information originally as Top Secret. The positions include the Secretary, the Deputy Secretaries, the Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, and some Executive Level IV officials and their deputies; Chiefs of Mission, Charges d\u2019affaires, and U.S. Representatives to various international organizations.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong story short, Clinton formally had a role in the classification process.\nBut practically, the responsibility to classify information was not, or ever, solely Clinton\u2019s.\nDaniel Metcalfe is professor of law at American University and former director of the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Information Policy.\n\"As a practical matter, 99 percent of the time, things that came to her would have been reviewed for classification and acted on by someone lower down,\" Metcalfe said. \"That doesn\u2019t preclude her from saying \u2018Oh my goodness, this should be classified,\u2019 because she is the ultimate authority within the State Department. But it wasn\u2019t her role.\"\nNate Jones, an archivist at the National Security Archives based at George Washington University, drew attention to an additional complexity. Clinton might be the final word at the State Department, but only for material that her agency first produced. If another agency, such as the CIA, was the original author, then it had the right to slap a security label on it that the State Department would need to respect.\n\"While I believe the other agencies' claims may very likely be dubious -- like claiming that the fact that the United States kills people in Pakistan with drones is classified -- they are allowed to bureaucratically make them despite Clinton being the agency head,\" Jones told PunditFact.\nAccording to the New York Times article, some of the emails in question contained Top Secret material that originated from intelligence agencies. Clinton has said that emails on her private server contained no information that was marked classified.\nWilliams did not respond to a request for comment.\nOur ruling\nWilliams said that at the State Department, Clinton was \"the decider\" over what was and wasn\u2019t classified material.\nFormally speaking, there is some truth to the claim. But practically, it\u2019s a stretch.\nThe responsibility is shared among many people, and while Clinton could play a role, it wouldn\u2019t typically be her primary or even secondary concern. Additionally, the secretary of state isn\u2019t the arbiter of information that originated from another agency.\nWilliams\u2019 claim is partially accurate.
