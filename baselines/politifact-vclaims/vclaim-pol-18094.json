Only his highly paid consultants, who are laughing all the way to the bank, still support him...And by the way, he did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBloomberg made his leadership skills a significant part of his argument for why voters should have considered him for the White House, so we wondered about the president\u2019s criticism. Even though Bloomberg has dropped out of the presidential contest, he has said he will spend money to defeat Trump, and Trump has continued to feud with him on Twitter.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe checked with the Trump campaign, and Deputy Communications Director Zach Parkinson sent us several examples of times when Bloomberg\u2019s approval rating suffered\u00a0in times of crisis. We also looked for examples.\nThey include:\n\n2005: Forty-five percent of New Yorkers approved, and 44 percent disapproved of Bloomberg\u2019s handling of a transit strike, according to a WNBC/Marist poll.\u00a0\n\n2009: During a nationwide economic crisis, Bloomberg\u2019s approval ratings dipped, according to a Marist Poll. The poll also found that 46 city voters disapproved\u00a0and 43 percent approved of his handling of the crisis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n2011: Fifty-one percent of city voters disapproved of the way Bloomberg handled Occupy Wall Street protestors, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.\u00a0\n\n\n2011: Bloomberg\u2019s approval rating dropped\u00a0after he was widely criticized for his handling of a snowstorm, and 71 percent of voters disapproved of his response to the storm, according to a Marist/NY1 poll.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe polls, however, were not all bad for Bloomberg in the aftermath of trying times:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2002: Fifty-seven percent of voters approved of the way he handled the recovery efforts after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to a New York Times poll published one year later.\u00a0\n\n2003: Fifty-nine percent of voters approved of the way Bloomberg handled a blackout, though in the same New York Times/CBS poll, only 32 percent of voters approved of his overall job as mayor.\u00a0\n\n\n2011: Bloomberg\u2019s approval ratings rose 11 points following his handling of Hurricane Irene, and 86 percent of voters approved of his handling of Irene readiness, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.\u00a0\n\n\n2012: In the last year as mayor, 75 percent of New York City voters\u00a0said Bloomberg had done an excellent or good job in responding to Hurricane Sandy, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.\u00a0\n\n\n\nElected after crisis\nIt should be noted how Bloomberg came into the mayor\u2019s office. As a candidate, Bloomberg seemed like a longshot on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, the day in which the city was to hold its primary election. But during the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, his popularity rose, and he narrowly won the general election.\nThe 2001 mayor\u2019s race could have hinged on many factors, not least of which that Bloomberg vastly outspent his rival, Democrat Mark Green.\u00a0\nThe Bloomberg campaign did not respond to emails about this fact-check. Bloomberg, however,\u00a0 laid out his case for his experience handling crises as mayor in a television ad filmed in late February. The ad highlighted his experience dealing with the aftermath of Sept. 11, the blackout of 2003, West Nile virus, and Hurricane Sandy.\u00a0\u00a0\nBloomberg has also expressed his ambivalence about polls in the past, telling The Atlantic magazine in 2012, \"If I finish my term in office \u2026 and have high approval ratings, then I wasted my last years in office. That high approval rating means you don\u2019t upset anybody.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nTrump tweeted that Bloomberg \"did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!\"\u00a0\nSometimes Bloomberg\u2019s approval ratings fell when the city faced tough times, sometimes they didn't. Voters disapproved of his handling of\u00a0a big snowstorm, Occupy Wall Street protestors and a\u00a0financial crisis. Voters, however, approved of how he handled recovery efforts after Sept. 11, managed\u00a0the city during a blackout\u00a0and responded\u00a0to some major storms.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18094"}
