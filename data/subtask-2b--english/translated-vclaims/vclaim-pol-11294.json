Chen, director of Romney &apos; s policy, wrote that our analysis runs counter to another ruling written by our partners in Polyte Fact Georgia. We also criticized Chen for citing the views of two economists with ties to the Obama administration. We considered the complaint and interviewed four other economists, none of whom were linked to any official or financial campaigns. Our additional report found no reason to change our judgment, which is often still wrong. Here is our examination of the facts, with an addition at the bottom reflecting our research and our new reports. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. \u2022 15 January 2021, Met Romney's campaign wants to know that the same president who calls for contraceptive coverage and points out that Congress, which has more female members, will achieve greater achievements, may also lead to disproportionate job losses among women. On April 6, 2012, Andrea Sol, Minister of Information of Romney, \"FACT: Women account for 92.3 per cent of the lost jobs under @BarakObama, a claim also filed on the Romney website. A few hours later, I followed up with this: \"@BarakObama tuts policies for women and 92.3% lost jobs under which r were women. He's more ignorant than we thought.\" When we requested support for the claim, the campaign mentioned national employment figures over four years. We found that despite the accuracy of the numbers, their reading was not correct. The Romney campaign referred to employment figures at the United States Labour Statistics Office from January 2009, when Obama took office, and March 2012, for all employees and female employees. * Total non-agricultural posts: January 2009: 133,561,000 March 2012: 132,821,000 net losses: 740,000. * Total non-agricultural posts as at January 2009: 66,122,000 March 2012: 65,439,000 net losses: 683,000. They then divided the net loss among women into the total net loss and reached 92.3 per cent. The first problem we find in Saul's tweet is that it begins to calculate job losses in the first month of Obama's tenure. We have taken points from previous claims to blame staff members for situations that existed at the beginning of their administrations, before they had time to implement their policies. One can reasonably claim that the employment figures in January 2009 are more the result of President George W. Bush &apos; s policies, at least to the extent that any president can be blamed or convicted for his employment in the private sector. We've reached out to Gary Steinberg, PLS spokesman. The loss of women &apos; s employment was high in that time period because millions of men had already lost their jobs. Women are next. Between January 2009 and March 2012, 57,000 jobs were lost by men, while 683,000 were lost by women. This is the opposite of the recession period from December 2007 to June 2009 (with six months overlapping) in which men lost 5,355,000 jobs and women lost 2,124,000 jobs), \"Steinberg said in an e-mail. So the timing was important. If all those jobs lost since 2007 are calculated, women account for only 39.7 per cent of the total. Gary Portless, a labour market expert at the Brookings Institution, explained the gender disparity. \"I believe that males have been disproportionately affected by the loss of employment in manufacturing, especially construction, which is particularly male-dominated. Many job losses in those industries had already occurred before Obama took office.\" \"Industry in which women are more likely to work - education, health and government - has been better in terms of job loss. Indeed, employment in health and education continued to grow during the recession and in the post-recovery period. It was only after the private economy (and private employment) started to grow again that government employment began to decline.\" Portless contributed $750 to the Obama campaign in 2011. In 2008, however, he provided advice on aspects of labour policy to the presidential campaign launched by Mr. John McCain, from R-Aries, and served as a government economist and worked in federal advisory groups under the auspices of the Presidents of the two parties). Betsy Stevenson, Professor of Business and Public Policy at Wharton College, University of Pennsylvania, and Professor of Visiting Economics at Princeton University, who previously served as Senior Economist of the Secretary of Labor of Obama, also noted that \"in every economic recession, men lose their jobs first and foremost, where men's unemployment rates are more cyclical than those of women.\" Many women &apos; s job losses had been government jobs - teachers and civil servants - which had been slower to return because they required greater government spending. So were Obama's policies particularly bad for women? Stevenson said: \"I don't think you can point to one indication that the pattern of job loss: men first and then women, is due to the President's policies. It is a historical pattern that has persisted in previous recessions.\" The Governor Romney website said that women accounted for 92.3% of lost jobs under Obama. By comparing the employment figures for January 2009 and March 2012 and balancing them with the figures for jobs held by women from the same periods, Saul achieved 92.3 per cent. The numbers are accurate, but they're completely misleading. First, Obama cannot be held fully responsible for the recruitment picture on the day he took office, just as he could not be credited if times were to flourish. Second, by selecting figures from January 2009, months after the recession, the statement ignored the millions of jobs that had been lost before, when most job losses fell on men. In every recession, men are the first to take the strike, followed by women. It's a historical pattern, told us by Stevenson, not the influence of Obama's policies. There is a small amount of truth to the prosecution, but it ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong. We've looked into Romney's campaign complaints, but we don't see any evidence to justify changing our judgment. The other economists agreed that the statement was misleading, and they often said that it was wrong to blame Obama for his broad trends, which were part of a long, deep recession. :: Bruce Bartlett, former official of the Departments of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush said that much of the decline for women was in the public sector. \"To the extent that there have been excessive job losses among women, much of this has to do with the fact that there has been a dramatic decline in government and local government employment,\" Bartlett said. \"The landing... was particularly evident in this recession rather than in other recessions.\" This graph from the Institute for Economic Policy, a labour-supported group, proves this. In previous periods of recession, public sector jobs began to increase again as the economy stabilized. After the recent recession, these countries continued to disappear. Again, these jobs are heavily occupied by women. Bartlett added that many of these government functions had been abolished in the states controlled by Republican conservatives and legislatures. This story in the Atlantic was cited by a study by the Liberal Roosevelt Institute that found that the 11 states that became Republican in 2010 accounted for 40.5 per cent of all job losses in the states and local governments. Jeff Hayes is a senior research analyst with the Women &apos; s Policy Research Institute, an organization affiliated with the George Washington University Graduate Programme for Public Policy, which receives contributions from groups including the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Hayes added that \"there is a delay before tax revenues are lost and government jobs are lost. \"If you broke 683,000 jobs, women lost between January 2009 and March 2012, 64% were in government and only 36% in the private sector.\" This brings us to a point raised by Ellen Applebaum with the left-hand centre for economic and political research. Following the first wave of funds in the President's stimulus bill, Obama had requested another $23 billion in \"emergency assistance\" for state and local governments. The funds were requested to avoid the demobilization of up to 300,000 public school teachers, but the leaders of the Republican House of Representatives stripped him of his clothes. \"You can barely blame Obama for it,\" said Appelbaum. With regard to the comparison of the item Poletti Fact Georgia, these direct comparisons are difficult. In this case, Georgia &apos; s judgment on the simpler issue of job creation was under President Ronald Reagan, while Romney &apos; s claim was to delete the critical details of job losses for men before Obama took office. Other organizations examined the Romney allegation and reached similar conclusions. Associated Press said that using 92.3 per cent as a measure of Obama's record of women was \"at best disturbing.\" The first reading, a political blog for NBC News, says, \"Does anyone, in a straight face, believe that 9 out of 10 jobs lost over the past three years have been female workers?\" The New York Times challenged the assertion of job losses under Obama. \"The chairpersons receive a great deal of appreciation or blame for the changes in the working cycle. Contrary to what appears to be a common view, Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama did not have the capacity or the ability unilaterally to direct the country towards good or bad labour markets. Also, President Romney, writer of the Times Economic magazine Catherine Rambelle, wrote in the Economix blog. We will conclude on this point: the experts agree that economic recovery has not helped women as much as men. Howard Wall, Professor of Economics at the University of Lindenwood, said it was fair to blame Obama for that. But he objected to the time frame for the rumney campaign -- starting in January 2009 while the recession was still going on. \"I think you have to sort of split the schedule. He called it \"Casad Bush\" and \"Obama Recovery,\" as Wall said. \"I don't give them credit (the Obama administration) for stopping the fall or causing the fall. They have nothing to do with this. But they have healing.\" Does all this mean that Obama's policies have brought hard times on women? Bartlett, Governor, said: \"There is no reason to believe that.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11294"}
