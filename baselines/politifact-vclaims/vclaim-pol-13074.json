And I made a simple mistake.\"\n\n-- Interview on Fox News Channel\u2019s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, May 17, 2011\n\n***\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., made a splash when he officially entered the 2012 presidential race in mid May. But it wasn\u2019t exactly the splash he was looking for.\n\nIn addition to a testy exchange with an Iowa voter that was caught on video, a glitter attack by a gay-rights protester, revelations that he had owed a six-figure amount to the luxury retailer Tiffany\u2019s and a series of articles questioning the accuracy of his facts, Gingrich also took heat from conservatives for an alleged flip-flop on whether he supported the budget plan written by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and passed by the GOP-controlled House.\n\nRyan\u2019s budget includes aggressive spending cuts that have energized conservatives, and changes to Medicare that have outraged liberals. Support for Ryan\u2019s plan has become something of a litmus test for Republicans, especially those running for the GOP presidential nomination. So Gingrich\u2019s stance on the plan was bound to become an issue.\n\nGingrich\u2019s views on Ryan\u2019s proposal have indeed varied over time -- and they\u2019ve also been somewhat more nuanced than the popular reaction would indicate.\n\nIn a Facebook post on March 17, 2010, Gingrich wrote favorably of Ryan\u2019s previous plan, known as the \"Roadmap.\" The \"Roadmap\" is broadly similar to the budget resolution passed earlier this year by the House, including in its approach to Medicare.\n\nGingrich\u2019s post called Ryan\u2019s proposal \"a comprehensive, bold solution to America\u2019s serious problem of rapidly rising debt. CBO scores the Roadmap reforms as achieving full solvency for Social Security and Medicare and eliminating all long term federal deficits, balancing the federal budget for the long haul. \u2026 I know Congressman Ryan remains committed to improving the quality of life for all Americans, both now and in the future, and this Roadmap represents a comprehensive way to achieve that.\"\n\nMore than a year later, Gingrich told Time magazine reporter Jay Newton Small that he would have voted for Ryan\u2019s latest plan if he\u2019d been serving in the House.\n\nPressed on whether it would \"actually save the health care system,\" Gingrich responded, \"No, I think it\u2019s the first step. You need an entirely new set of solutions.\"\n\nIn other words, Gingrich indicated that the plan was worth voting for but added that it was not a silver bullet.\n\nA few days after that, in comments at the Brookings Institution on April 23, 2011, Gingrich once again praised Ryan\u2019s big-picture thinking but added that \"there are details (of the plan) I disagree with.\" According to an account in the Daily Caller, one of his reservations involved \"cutting investment in science and research.\"\n\nReductions in science funding envisioned under Ryan\u2019s plan are \"essentially like saying I want to save money on your car, we\u2019re not going to change the oil. And for about a year I can get away with it. And then the engine will freeze up, and we\u2019ll have to replace your engine. But if I have a CBO that scores oil but doesn\u2019t score engines, I can annually replace the engine for free, because it won\u2019t count as a budget cost.\"\n\nThis seems to reinforce a view that Gingrich supported the proposal, but not without qualifications.\n\nThen came the Meet the Press interview on May 15, 2011.\n\nHost David Gregory asked Gingrich, \"Do you think that Republicans ought to buck the public opposition and really move forward to completely change Medicare, turn it into a voucher program where you give seniors \u2026 some premium support and -- so that they can go out and buy private insurance?\"\n\nGingrich responded, \"I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering. I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate.\"\n\nAfter explaining his desire to instead cut waste and abuse, Gingrich insisted that \"there are things you can do to improve Medicare.\"\n\n\"But not what Paul Ryan is suggesting, which is completely changing Medicare?\" Gregory suggested.\n\nGingrich said, \"I, I think that, I think, I think that that is too big a jump. I think what you want to have is a system where people voluntarily migrate to better outcomes, better solutions, better options, not one where you suddenly impose upon the -- I don't want to -- I'm against Obamacare, which is imposing radical change, and I would be against a conservative imposing radical change.\"\n\nWhile Gingrich didn\u2019t explicitly tell Gregory, \"I wouldn\u2019t have voted for the Ryan proposal,\" his stance seems pretty clear to us -- that he did not favor the Ryan Medicare overhaul. So we think it\u2019s fair to say that, after the Meet the Press interview, Gingrich had at the very least done a half-flip on the question of whether to implement the Ryan proposal.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the end of it.\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page the day after the Meet the Press appearance, Gingrich backtracked somewhat. He said he had \"probably used too strong language\" on the show, though he added, \"I have thought about this for a long time and I am very, very worried. \u2026 I think it would be politically catastrophic to pass the bill in its current form,\" at a moment when conservatives have an opportunity \"to break the left for the first time since 1932.\"\n\nSo Gingrich indicated to the Wall Street Journal that he\u2019d overstated his view, but still thought that it would be \"politically catastrophic to pass the bill in its current form.\"\n\nYet there was more to come.\n\nAs a wave of criticism built, mostly from conservatives outraged at his failure to fully back Ryan\u2019s proposal, Gingrich went on Fox News Channel\u2019s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren on May 17, 2011, to extend and clarify his remarks.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I made a mistake,\" Gingrich said. \"And I called Paul Ryan today, who's a very close personal friend and I said that. The fact is that I have supported what Ryan has tried to do on the budget. The fact is that my newsletter strongly praised the budget when he brought it out. And the budget vote is one that I'm happy to say I would have voted for. I will defend and I will be glad to answer any Democrat who attempts to distort what I said. And I made a simple mistake. ...\n\n\"So, let me say on the record: Any ad which quotes what I said Sunday is a falsehood and because I have said publicly, those words were inaccurate and unfortunate. And I'm prepared to stand up -- when I make a mistake, and I'm going to on occasion, I want to stand up and share with the American people, that was a mistake, because that way, we can have an honest conversation.\"\n\nIn other words, Gingrich used the appearance with Van Susteren to back away from any suggestion that he would have voted against the Ryan plan.\n\nAs we indicated, a close reading of the Meet the Press transcript shows that Gingrich never precisely said that he would have voted against the Ryan plan. But he certainly made clear that he thought a key provision of the plan -- the changes to Medicare -- were \"too big a jump\" for him to support. And by saying on Van Susteren\u2019s show that he \"made a mistake\" in his Meet the Press comments -- a big enough mistake that he felt a need to call Ryan and smooth things over -- it seems like a tacit admission of a flip-flop.\n\nWe do think that, taken as a whole, there has been more nuance to Gingrich\u2019s stance than some of the coverage has indicated. But his philosophical travels -- from the full-throated Facebook endorsement in 2010, to qualified endorsements in the Time interview and at the Brookings conference, to the downbeat assessment on Meet the Press, to the hasty re-endorsement on Van Susteren\u2019s show -- indicate that Gingrich\u2019s support for the Ryan proposal has ebbed and flowed over time.\n\nGingrich seems to have gone full circle in his views on the proposal, and it qualifies in our book as a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13074"}
