Yournewswire.com is a fake news website.\nIn this case, the article is not entirely fictional because it was based on a threat by an ISIS supporter. However, there is no evidence that Trump responded with her own threat against former President Barack Obama.\nYournewswire.com cites an article in the Washington Free Beacon, which stated that pro-ISIS internet channels called for the assassination of the son of Melania and President Donald Trump. The Free Beacon attributed the information to the Middle East Media Research Institute, an organization that tracks jihadist propaganda. The institute found the information about the threat against Barron on Telegram, a social media network.\nHere\u2019s what the group reported:\nOn November 21, 2017, a supporter of the Islamic State (ISIS) on Telegram called for the assassination of Barron Trump, and shared the name of the school that Barron attends along with a Google map pinpointing its location. Using the hashtag \"handle the son of the mule of America,\" the supporter, who uses the name \"Dak Al-Munafiqeen,\" Arabic for \"striking the hypocrites,\" wrote: \"Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington.\" The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump. To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post.\nThe report drew scant mainstream media attention. While Telegram is used by a lot of people worldwide, it is particularly popular with jihadis and ISIS supporters, said Steven Stalinsky, MEMRI executive director.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the main vehicle for ISIS and their supporters to use to communicate and put out propaganda,\" he said.\nThe threat against Barron on Telegram from a supporter is not the equivalent of an official communique by ISIS, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact.\n\"The fact that someone on an ISIS channel said it online doesn\u2019t make it a significant threat,\" he said. \"Anything said by some extremist on Telegram is not exactly breaking news that most outlets pick up in any way.\"\nWhere the YourNewsWire.com story really goes into fake territory is the idea that Melania Trump responded to the threat by saying \"if ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I\u2019ll scratch Obama\u2019s eyes out.\" We could not find any evidence that she responded at all.\nWe contacted YourNewsWire.com and received a reply from the editor in chief, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, who said PolitiFact is \"policing the internet as part of a a faux moral crusade on behalf of the Clinton regime.\"\nOur ruling\nYourNewsWire.com stated that Melania Trump said, \"If ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I\u2019ll scratch Obama\u2019s eyes out.\"\nWe found no evidence that Melania Trump responded to an online threat against Barron at all \u2014 much less that she said she would enact revenge on Obama.\nWe rate this headline Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2017-11-28 15:57:39 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Melania Trump: 'If ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I\u2019ll scratch Obama\u2019s eyes out.' \"    Internet Rumors Bloggers https://yournewswire.com/melania-trump-isis-barron-obama/   In a blog post Thursday, November 23, 2017 2017-11-23    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02650"}
