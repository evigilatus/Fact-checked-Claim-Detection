0001	WOODRUFF	Good evening, and thank you.
0002	WOODRUFF	We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate.
0003	WOODRUFF	We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook, who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided.
0004	WOODRUFF	And tonight you're going to hear some of their questions for the candidates.
0005	WOODRUFF	And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook.
0006	WOODRUFF	We also want to thank our hosts, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, on whose campus we meet, here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall.
0007	IFILL	We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television, as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight.
0008	IFILL	This is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face.
0009	IFILL	Each time, we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be.
0010	IFILL	You know you're watching  whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or neither  because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you.
0011	IFILL	And we believe that, too.
0012	IFILL	With that, let's welcome the candidates to the stage.
0013	IFILL	Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
0014	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0015	WOODRUFF	Welcome, Senator, great to see you.
0016	WOODRUFF	And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
0017	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0018	WOODRUFF	Very good to be here with you.
0019	CLINTON	Thank you.
0020	IFILL	Welcome to you both.
0021	WOODRUFF	Now, a word about format.
0022	WOODRUFF	There will be two short breaks, and the rules are simple 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond.
0023	IFILL	With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us, we are now broadening the conversation to America's heartland and beyond, including here in Wisconsin.
0024	IFILL	Now let's turn to the candidates for their opening statements.
0025	IFILL	The order was decided by coin toss.
0026	IFILL	And, Senator Sanders, you go first.
0027	SANDERS	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0028	SANDERS	And, PBS, thank you.
0029	SANDERS	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0030	SANDERS	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0031	SANDERS	A lot has happened in nine months.
0032	SANDERS	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0033	SANDERS	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0034	SANDERS	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0035	SANDERS	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0036	SANDERS	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0037	SANDERS	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0038	SANDERS	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0039	SANDERS	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0040	SANDERS	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0041	SANDERS	No criminal records for them.
0042	SANDERS	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0043	SANDERS	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0044	SANDERS	Thank you.
0045	IFILL	Thank you, Senator Sanders.
0046	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0047	IFILL	Thank you, Senator Sanders.
0048	IFILL	Secretary Clinton.
0049	CLINTON	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0050	CLINTON	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0051	CLINTON	And for good cause.
0052	CLINTON	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0053	CLINTON	There aren't enough goodpaying jobs, especially for young people.
0054	CLINTON	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0055	CLINTON	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0056	CLINTON	But I want to go further.
0057	CLINTON	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0058	CLINTON	AfricanAmericans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0059	CLINTON	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0060	CLINTON	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0061	CLINTON	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0062	CLINTON	That will be my mission as president.
0063	CLINTON	And I think together we will make progress.
0064	WOODRUFF	Thank you both.
0065	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0066	WOODRUFF	Thank you both.
0067	WOODRUFF	And we'll be right back after a short break to begin questions.
0068	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0069	WOODRUFF	And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee.
0070	WOODRUFF	Let's get right to the questions.
0071	WOODRUFF	Senator Sanders, to you first.
0072	WOODRUFF	Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and they're asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government?
0073	WOODRUFF	It's already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy.
0074	WOODRUFF	How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency?
0075	SANDERS	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top onetenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0076	SANDERS	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going  getting poorer.
0077	SANDERS	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0078	SANDERS	Our Medicare for all singlepayer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0079	SANDERS	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0080	SANDERS	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0081	SANDERS	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0082	SANDERS	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0083	WOODRUFF	But, my question is how big would government be?
0084	WOODRUFF	Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...
0085	SANDERS	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0086	SANDERS	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0087	CLINTON	Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans  let's take healthcare for example.
0088	CLINTON	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0089	CLINTON	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0090	CLINTON	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0091	SANDERS	Well, let us level with the American people.
0092	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0093	SANDERS	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0094	SANDERS	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0095	SANDERS	But, here is the truth.
0096	SANDERS	Twentynine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0097	SANDERS	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0098	SANDERS	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0099	SANDERS	Millions of people have high deductibles and copayments.
0100	SANDERS	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle  the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0101	SANDERS	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0102	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0103	CLINTON	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0104	CLINTON	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0105	CLINTON	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0106	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0107	CLINTON	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment  namely the Affordable Care Act  is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0108	CLINTON	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0109	CLINTON	We have to get the remaining 10.
0110	CLINTON	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0111	CLINTON	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0112	CLINTON	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0113	CLINTON	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0114	CLINTON	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0115	CLINTON	So if you're having Medicare for all, singlepayer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0116	CLINTON	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0117	IFILL	Final thought, Senator.
0118	SANDERS	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0119	SANDERS	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0120	SANDERS	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0121	SANDERS	There is one major country  the United States  which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0122	SANDERS	Please do not tell me that in this country, if  and here's the if  we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0123	CLINTON	Well, let me just  let me just say, once again...
0124	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0125	CLINTON	...that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0126	CLINTON	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0127	CLINTON	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0128	CLINTON	And we are not England.
0129	CLINTON	We are not France.
0130	CLINTON	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0131	CLINTON	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0132	CLINTON	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0133	CLINTON	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0134	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0135	IFILL	I'd like to move along.
0136	IFILL	I'd like to move along.
0137	IFILL	Secretary Clinton, you might  you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government.
0138	IFILL	You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said "The era of big government is over."
0139	IFILL	You may remember that.
0140	IFILL	When asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied.
0141	IFILL	Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you?
0142	CLINTON	No.
0143	CLINTON	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0144	CLINTON	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debtfree tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0145	CLINTON	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0146	CLINTON	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0147	CLINTON	I'm aware of that.
0148	CLINTON	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0149	CLINTON	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0150	IFILL	But I haven't heard either of you put a price tag on your  you say...
0151	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0152	CLINTON	I will put a price tag.
0153	CLINTON	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0154	CLINTON	And again, paid for.
0155	CLINTON	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0156	CLINTON	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0157	CLINTON	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0158	CLINTON	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0159	IFILL	Senator?
0160	SANDERS	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0161	SANDERS	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0162	SANDERS	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0163	SANDERS	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0164	SANDERS	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working parttime is close to 10 percent?
0165	SANDERS	Who denies that AfricanAmerican youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0166	SANDERS	We need to create jobs.
0167	SANDERS	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0168	SANDERS	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0169	SANDERS	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0170	SANDERS	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession  Great Depression.
0171	SANDERS	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuitionfree.
0172	SANDERS	We bailed them out.
0173	SANDERS	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0174	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0175	CLINTON	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0176	CLINTON	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debtfree tuition.
0177	CLINTON	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0178	CLINTON	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0179	CLINTON	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0180	CLINTON	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0181	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0182	WOODRUFF	Next, we're going to...
0183	SANDERS	A brief response.
0184	WOODRUFF	Very brief, thank you.
0185	SANDERS	Here is where we are with public education.
0186	SANDERS	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0187	SANDERS	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0188	SANDERS	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0189	SANDERS	The world has changed.
0190	SANDERS	This is 2016.
0191	SANDERS	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0192	SANDERS	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0193	SANDERS	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0194	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0195	WOODRUFF	Secretary Clinton, your campaign  you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters.
0196	WOODRUFF	You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president.
0197	WOODRUFF	But in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders.
0198	WOODRUFF	What are women missing about you?
0199	CLINTON	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0200	CLINTON	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0201	CLINTON	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0202	CLINTON	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0203	CLINTON	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0204	CLINTON	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0205	CLINTON	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0206	CLINTON	That's what I'm working towards.
0207	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0208	WOODRUFF	As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that there's a special place in Hell for women who don't support other women.
0209	WOODRUFF	Do you agree with what she said?
0210	CLINTON	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0211	CLINTON	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0212	CLINTON	That's what I've always stood for.
0213	CLINTON	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0214	CLINTON	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0215	CLINTON	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0216	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0217	WOODRUFF	Senator Sanders, you're in the minority, but we still want to hear from you.
0218	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0219	SANDERS	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, AfricanAmericans, Latinos, AsianAmericans.
0220	SANDERS	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0221	SANDERS	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct  I think I am  that I have a lifetime  and I've been in Congress a few years  a lifetime 100 percent prochoice voting record.
0222	SANDERS	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0223	SANDERS	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0224	SANDERS	And we will join the rest of the other  the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0225	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0226	IFILL	Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?
0227	SANDERS	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0228	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0229	CLINTON	You know, I have said  I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0230	CLINTON	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commanderinchief.
0231	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0232	CLINTON	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0233	CLINTON	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0234	CLINTON	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0235	CLINTON	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0236	CLINTON	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hardfought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0237	CLINTON	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0238	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0239	WOODRUFF	Final comment.
0240	SANDERS	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0241	SANDERS	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0242	SANDERS	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0243	SANDERS	Just a little bit.
0244	SANDERS	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0245	SANDERS	Government is the enemy.
0246	SANDERS	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0247	SANDERS	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0248	SANDERS	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0249	SANDERS	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0250	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0251	IFILL	Thank you both.
0252	IFILL	We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook.
0253	IFILL	They were selected from a curated group of people we've been following of undecided voters.
0254	IFILL	The first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54yearold woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin.
0255	IFILL	And she writes "Wisconsin is number one in AfricanAmerican male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study.
0256	IFILL	They found that Wisconsin's incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country's rate.
0257	IFILL	What can we do across the nation to address this?"
0258	IFILL	Senator Sanders.
0259	SANDERS	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0260	SANDERS	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0261	SANDERS	It has to be dealt with.
0262	SANDERS	Today a male AfricanAmerican baby born today stands a oneinfour chance of ending up in jail.
0263	SANDERS	That is beyond unspeakable.
0264	SANDERS	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0265	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0266	SANDERS	What we have to do is end overpolicing in AfricanAmerican neighborhoods.
0267	SANDERS	The reality is that both the AfricanAmerican community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0268	SANDERS	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0269	SANDERS	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0270	SANDERS	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0271	SANDERS	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0272	SANDERS	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often AfricanAmericans, shot by police officers.
0273	SANDERS	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0274	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0275	CLINTON	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0276	CLINTON	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0277	CLINTON	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for AfricanAmericans in our nation, twice the national average.
0278	CLINTON	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0279	CLINTON	His family certainly believes that.
0280	CLINTON	And so do I.
0281	CLINTON	So we have work to do.
0282	CLINTON	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0283	CLINTON	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0284	CLINTON	I have fully endorsed those.
0285	CLINTON	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0286	CLINTON	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0287	CLINTON	But, I would also add this.
0288	CLINTON	There are other racial discrepancies.
0289	CLINTON	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0290	CLINTON	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0291	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0292	SANDERS	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0293	SANDERS	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0294	SANDERS	It takes away discretion from judges.
0295	SANDERS	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0296	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0297	SANDERS	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0298	SANDERS	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0299	SANDERS	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up  we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0300	SANDERS	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0301	SANDERS	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0302	SANDERS	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0303	SANDERS	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0304	SANDERS	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0305	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0306	WOODRUFF	Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example.
0307	WOODRUFF	Hardly anyone believes that they have.
0308	WOODRUFF	Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency?
0309	WOODRUFF	What would you do that the nation's first African American has not been able to?
0310	CLINTON	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0311	CLINTON	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0312	CLINTON	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0313	CLINTON	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0314	CLINTON	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0315	CLINTON	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0316	CLINTON	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0317	CLINTON	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0318	CLINTON	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0319	CLINTON	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0320	CLINTON	But, we can't rest.
0321	CLINTON	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0322	CLINTON	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0323	CLINTON	Nobody can deny them.
0324	CLINTON	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0325	CLINTON	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0326	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0327	WOODRUFF	Senator Sanders?
0328	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0329	SANDERS	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0330	SANDERS	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0331	SANDERS	Turns out that the AfricanAmerican community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0332	SANDERS	As I understand it, the AfricanAmerican community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0333	SANDERS	So when you have childhood AfricanAmerican poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration  which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother  clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0334	SANDERS	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0335	SANDERS	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are AfricanAmerican.
0336	WOODRUFF	So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than they've been?
0337	SANDERS	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for lowincome kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0338	SANDERS	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0339	SANDERS	And I think when you give lowincome kids  AfricanAmerican, white, Latino kids  the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0340	SANDERS	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0341	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0342	IFILL	Let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about AfricanAmericans, people of color.
0343	IFILL	I want to talk about white people, OK?
0344	SANDERS	White people?
0345	IFILL	I know.
0346	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0347	IFILL	So many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country.
0348	IFILL	By the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite.
0349	IFILL	Our public schools are already there.
0350	IFILL	If workingclass, white Americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, don't they have a reason to be resentful, Senator  Secretary Clinton?
0351	CLINTON	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0352	CLINTON	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0353	CLINTON	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0354	CLINTON	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0355	CLINTON	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0356	CLINTON	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0357	CLINTON	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0358	CLINTON	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has  the 102030 proposal  to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0359	CLINTON	And you know what?
0360	CLINTON	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0361	CLINTON	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans  particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have  you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0362	CLINTON	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0363	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0364	IFILL	Senator  Senator, I want you to respond to that, but I also want you to  am I wrong?
0365	IFILL	Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race?
0366	SANDERS	Yeah, you can, because AfricanAmericans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0367	SANDERS	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0368	SANDERS	But it is a general economic issue.
0369	SANDERS	And here's what the economic issue is.
0370	SANDERS	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0371	SANDERS	Why is that?
0372	SANDERS	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0373	SANDERS	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0374	SANDERS	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0375	SANDERS	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0376	SANDERS	You once had a pension.
0377	SANDERS	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0378	SANDERS	They're off to China.
0379	SANDERS	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0380	SANDERS	What have you got now?
0381	SANDERS	You are working at McDonald's?
0382	SANDERS	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0383	SANDERS	People have worked their entire lives.
0384	SANDERS	They're making a half, twothirds what they used to make.
0385	SANDERS	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0386	SANDERS	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0387	SANDERS	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0388	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0389	WOODRUFF	Thank you.
0390	WOODRUFF	Senator Sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants.
0391	WOODRUFF	President Obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits.
0392	WOODRUFF	Would you go further than that?
0393	WOODRUFF	And if so, how specifically would you do it?
0394	WOODRUFF	Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in Nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency?
0395	SANDERS	The answer is yes.
0396	SANDERS	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0397	SANDERS	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0398	SANDERS	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0399	SANDERS	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0400	SANDERS	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0401	SANDERS	And in fact I would go further.
0402	SANDERS	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0403	SANDERS	And let me say this also.
0404	SANDERS	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0405	SANDERS	And I would not support those.
0406	SANDERS	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0407	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0408	CLINTON	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0409	CLINTON	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0410	CLINTON	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0411	CLINTON	I am against the raids.
0412	CLINTON	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0413	CLINTON	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0414	CLINTON	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0415	CLINTON	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0416	CLINTON	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0417	CLINTON	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0418	CLINTON	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0419	CLINTON	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0420	CLINTON	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0421	CLINTON	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0422	CLINTON	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0423	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0424	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0425	SANDERS	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0426	SANDERS	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0427	SANDERS	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0428	SANDERS	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guestworker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0429	SANDERS	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0430	SANDERS	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0431	SANDERS	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0432	SANDERS	It was the AFLCIO.
0433	SANDERS	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0434	SANDERS	But we are where we are right now.
0435	SANDERS	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0436	SANDERS	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0437	CLINTON	Two quick responses.
0438	CLINTON	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0439	CLINTON	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privatelyrun detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0440	CLINTON	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0441	CLINTON	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0442	CLINTON	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0443	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0444	WOODRUFF	I'd like...
0445	SANDERS	Well, let me just respond.
0446	SANDERS	I worked with Ted Kennedy.
0447	SANDERS	He was the chairman of my committee.
0448	SANDERS	And I loved Ted Kennedy.
0449	SANDERS	But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFLCIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don't apologize for that vote.
0450	SANDERS	But in terms of the children, I don't know to whom you're sending a message.
0451	SANDERS	Who are you sending a message to?
0452	SANDERS	These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake.
0453	SANDERS	That was the fact.
0454	SANDERS	I don't think we use them to send a message.
0455	SANDERS	I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together.
0456	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0457	CLINTON	Well, that just wasn't  that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0458	CLINTON	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0459	CLINTON	So we have a disagreement on this.
0460	CLINTON	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0461	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0462	IFILL	If you would allow me now to move on, we've been talking about children.
0463	IFILL	I want to talk about seniors.
0464	IFILL	That takes us to our second Facebook question from Farheen Hakeem, who writes, "My father"  she's a 40yearold woman who works for a nonprofit here in Milwaukee.
0465	IFILL	And she writes, "My father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaid's family community program in Milwaukee County for lowincome seniors.
0466	IFILL	How will you as president work to ensure lowincome seniors get their basic needs met?"
0467	IFILL	Start with you, Senator Sanders.
0468	SANDERS	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0469	SANDERS	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0470	SANDERS	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0471	SANDERS	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors  and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country  who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0472	SANDERS	And you know what?
0473	SANDERS	You do the arithmetic.
0474	SANDERS	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0475	SANDERS	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0476	SANDERS	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0477	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0478	SANDERS	And when we  and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0479	SANDERS	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0480	SANDERS	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0481	SANDERS	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0482	SANDERS	That is not what America should be about.
0483	SANDERS	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0484	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0485	CLINTON	I think  I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0486	CLINTON	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0487	CLINTON	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0488	CLINTON	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0489	CLINTON	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of lowincome seniors who worked at lowwage jobs.
0490	CLINTON	I want to take care of women.
0491	CLINTON	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0492	CLINTON	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0493	CLINTON	They do not get any credit for their caretaking responsibilities.
0494	CLINTON	And the people who are often the most hardhit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to onehalf of their Social Security monthly payment.
0495	CLINTON	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0496	CLINTON	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0497	SANDERS	In all due respect...
0498	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0499	SANDERS	...In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0500	SANDERS	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0501	SANDERS	And what is that proposal?
0502	SANDERS	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0503	SANDERS	You opposed him then.
0504	SANDERS	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0505	SANDERS	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0506	SANDERS	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0507	CLINTON	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0508	CLINTON	We both want to get more revenue in.
0509	CLINTON	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the  raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0510	CLINTON	That has not been...
0511	SANDERS	That's my bill.
0512	SANDERS	Check it out.
0513	CLINTON	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0514	CLINTON	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0515	CLINTON	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0516	CLINTON	We're going to end up in the same place.
0517	CLINTON	We're going to get more revenue.
0518	CLINTON	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0519	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0520	WOODRUFF	We're going to move on.
0521	WOODRUFF	Secretary Clinton, your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of Senator Sanders for attending Democratic Party fundraisers from which you say he benefited.
0522	WOODRUFF	But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, George Soros and Donald Sussman, for a total of about $10 million.
0523	WOODRUFF	You have said that there's no quid pro quo involved.
0524	WOODRUFF	Is that also true of the donations that wealthy Republicans give to Republican candidates, contributors including the Koch Brothers?
0525	CLINTON	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0526	CLINTON	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0527	CLINTON	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0528	CLINTON	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0529	CLINTON	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0530	CLINTON	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0531	CLINTON	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0532	CLINTON	I think that is the real key here.
0533	CLINTON	We both have a lot of small donors.
0534	CLINTON	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0535	CLINTON	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0536	CLINTON	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0537	CLINTON	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0538	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0539	WOODRUFF	I'm asking if Democratic donors are different than Republican donors.
0540	SANDERS	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0541	SANDERS	We have to be honest about it.
0542	SANDERS	It is undermining American democracy.
0543	SANDERS	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0544	SANDERS	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0545	SANDERS	And, we said no.
0546	SANDERS	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0547	SANDERS	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0548	SANDERS	And, it turns out that up until  and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0549	SANDERS	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0550	SANDERS	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0551	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0552	IFILL	Senator Sanders, are you saying...
0553	CLINTON	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0554	CLINTON	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0555	CLINTON	I'm very proud.
0556	CLINTON	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0557	CLINTON	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0558	CLINTON	It's not my PAC.
0559	CLINTON	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0560	CLINTON	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0561	CLINTON	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0562	CLINTON	He pushed through, and he passed the DoddFrank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0563	CLINTON	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0564	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0565	SANDERS	The people aren't dumb.
0566	SANDERS	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0567	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0568	SANDERS	But let's not  but let's not  let's not insult  let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0569	SANDERS	People aren't dumb.
0570	SANDERS	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0571	SANDERS	I guess just for the fun of it they want to throw money around.
0572	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0573	SANDERS	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0574	SANDERS	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0575	SANDERS	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay  spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0576	SANDERS	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0577	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0578	SANDERS	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0579	SANDERS	I voted for DoddFrank, got an important amendment in it.
0580	SANDERS	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0581	SANDERS	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0582	SANDERS	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0583	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0584	CLINTON	Well, let's just  let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of DoddFrank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0585	CLINTON	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0586	CLINTON	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0587	CLINTON	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0588	CLINTON	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0589	CLINTON	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0590	CLINTON	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0591	CLINTON	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0592	CLINTON	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0593	CLINTON	It goes in the right direction.
0594	CLINTON	We have DoddFrank.
0595	CLINTON	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0596	CLINTON	But let's not kid ourselves.
0597	CLINTON	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0598	CLINTON	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...[
0599	CLINTON	crosstalk ]
0600	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0601	WOODRUFF	We have to go to a break.
0602	WOODRUFF	We...
0603	SANDERS	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0604	SANDERS	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing twothirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trustbuster would have said break them up.
0605	SANDERS	I think he would have been right.
0606	SANDERS	I think he would have said bring back a 21stcentury GlassSteagall legislation.
0607	SANDERS	I think that would have been right, as well.
0608	SANDERS	That's my view.
0609	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0610	WOODRUFF	All right.
0611	WOODRUFF	Thank you both.
0612	WOODRUFF	It is time for a break.
0613	WOODRUFF	And when we come back, we're going to turn to some new topics, including how these candidates will keep America safe.
0614	IFILL	There's a lot more to come in just a few minutes.
0615	IFILL	Stay with us for more of the PBS NewsHour Democratic Debate.
0616	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0617	WOODRUFF	Welcome back to the Democratic presidential debate.
0618	WOODRUFF	Before we return to our questions, we have a followup question from our Facebook group.
0619	WOODRUFF	And it is to Senator Sanders.
0620	WOODRUFF	Senator, it comes from Bill Corfield.
0621	WOODRUFF	He is a 55yearold musician from Troy, Ohio.
0622	WOODRUFF	And he asks "Are there any areas of government you would like to reduce?"
0623	SANDERS	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0624	SANDERS	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0625	IFILL	How about you, Senator Clinton  Secretary Clinton?
0626	CLINTON	Absolutely.
0627	CLINTON	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0628	CLINTON	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0629	CLINTON	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0630	CLINTON	And that's what I intend to do.
0631	SANDERS	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0632	SANDERS	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0633	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0634	IFILL	We spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity.
0635	IFILL	The second part, we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities.
0636	IFILL	And we want to start with a question for you, Secretary Clinton, about America's role in the world.
0637	IFILL	Americans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home, that they already are, in fact, here.
0638	IFILL	According to exit polls from last week, from earlier this week, more than twothirds of Democrats in New Hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they can't win.
0639	IFILL	They fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready.
0640	IFILL	Are we?
0641	CLINTON	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0642	CLINTON	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 911, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0643	CLINTON	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0644	CLINTON	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS  that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0645	CLINTON	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0646	CLINTON	That is principally an Americanled air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0647	CLINTON	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0648	CLINTON	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0649	CLINTON	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0650	CLINTON	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0651	CLINTON	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0652	CLINTON	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0653	CLINTON	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a realtime fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0654	CLINTON	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0655	CLINTON	You know, after 911, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0656	CLINTON	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0657	CLINTON	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0658	CLINTON	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0659	CLINTON	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0660	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0661	CLINTON	...stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0662	CLINTON	It's not only offensive it's dangerous.
0663	CLINTON	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0664	CLINTON	I know how to do that.
0665	CLINTON	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0666	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0667	CLINTON	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0668	CLINTON	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0669	IFILL	Senator Sanders...
0670	SANDERS	Let me  let me just say this.
0671	SANDERS	What a President of the United States has got to do and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility is to, a, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values, that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0672	SANDERS	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0673	SANDERS	And if you go to my Web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0674	SANDERS	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0675	SANDERS	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0676	SANDERS	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0677	SANDERS	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0678	SANDERS	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0679	SANDERS	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0680	SANDERS	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0681	SANDERS	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0682	SANDERS	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0683	SANDERS	But this is nothing new.
0684	SANDERS	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0685	SANDERS	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0686	SANDERS	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democraticallyelected prime minister of Iran.
0687	SANDERS	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0688	SANDERS	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0689	SANDERS	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0690	SANDERS	Unintended consequences.
0691	SANDERS	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0692	SANDERS	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0693	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0694	CLINTON	If I could just respond.
0695	CLINTON	Two points.
0696	CLINTON	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0697	CLINTON	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0698	CLINTON	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0699	CLINTON	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0700	CLINTON	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commanderinchief.
0701	CLINTON	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0702	CLINTON	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0703	CLINTON	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0704	CLINTON	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0705	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0706	SANDERS	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0707	SANDERS	Secretary of state for four years.
0708	SANDERS	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0709	SANDERS	But judgment matters as well.
0710	SANDERS	Judgment matters as well.
0711	SANDERS	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0712	SANDERS	I lead the opposition against it.
0713	SANDERS	She voted for it.
0714	SANDERS	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0715	SANDERS	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0716	SANDERS	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0717	CLINTON	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0718	CLINTON	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0719	CLINTON	I looked at the evidence.
0720	CLINTON	I looked at the intelligence.
0721	CLINTON	I got the briefings.
0722	CLINTON	I recommended that the president go forward.
0723	CLINTON	It was a hard choice.
0724	CLINTON	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0725	CLINTON	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0726	CLINTON	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0727	CLINTON	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0728	CLINTON	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0729	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0730	SANDERS	Judy, one area very briefly...
0731	WOODRUFF	Just a final word.
0732	SANDERS	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate  and I believe in her book  very good book, by the way  in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0733	SANDERS	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0734	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0735	SANDERS	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0736	SANDERS	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0737	SANDERS	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0738	SANDERS	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0739	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0740	IFILL	Secretary Clinton?
0741	CLINTON	Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.
0742	SANDERS	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0743	SANDERS	That's for sure.
0744	CLINTON	That's fine.
0745	CLINTON	That's fine.
0746	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0747	CLINTON	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0748	CLINTON	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0749	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0750	CLINTON	So if we want to pick and choose  and I certainly do  people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0751	SANDERS	It is.
0752	CLINTON	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0753	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0754	SANDERS	I find  I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0755	SANDERS	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0756	SANDERS	Not everybody remembers that.
0757	SANDERS	You do.
0758	SANDERS	I do.
0759	SANDERS	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0760	SANDERS	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0761	SANDERS	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0762	SANDERS	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0763	SANDERS	Not my kind of guy.
0764	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0765	WOODRUFF	Senator, let me  let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship, Senator Sanders, and that's Russia.
0766	WOODRUFF	On the one hand, we're aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with.
0767	WOODRUFF	Just tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead  that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all  have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad, has not gone after ISIS.
0768	WOODRUFF	So my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with Russia, are you prepared  how hard are you prepared to be?
0769	WOODRUFF	Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions?
0770	WOODRUFF	Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe?
0771	WOODRUFF	It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States.
0772	SANDERS	Well, this is what I would say.
0773	SANDERS	It is a complicated relationship.
0774	SANDERS	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0775	SANDERS	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed  men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country  their own country  it is unspeakable.
0776	SANDERS	It is a real horror.
0777	SANDERS	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0778	SANDERS	But let's be clear Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO  correctly, I believe  are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0779	SANDERS	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0780	SANDERS	But bottom line is The president is right.
0781	SANDERS	We have to put more money.
0782	SANDERS	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0783	CLINTON	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0784	CLINTON	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0785	CLINTON	The agreement on a ceasefire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0786	CLINTON	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0787	CLINTON	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual ceasefire?
0788	CLINTON	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that ceasefire up as quickly as possible.
0789	CLINTON	But I would add this.
0790	CLINTON	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0791	CLINTON	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a ceasefire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0792	CLINTON	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0793	CLINTON	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0794	CLINTON	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0795	CLINTON	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0796	CLINTON	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0797	CLINTON	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the ceasefire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0798	CLINTON	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0799	CLINTON	So as we get a ceasefire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0800	CLINTON	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0801	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0802	SANDERS	Let me just  just say this.
0803	SANDERS	For a start, the secretary and I disagree  and I think the president does not agree with her  in terms of the concept of a nofly zone in Syria.
0804	SANDERS	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0805	SANDERS	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0806	SANDERS	Let's hope that it holds.
0807	SANDERS	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0808	SANDERS	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0809	SANDERS	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0810	SANDERS	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0811	SANDERS	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0812	SANDERS	That's how you make peace in the world.
0813	SANDERS	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0814	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0815	CLINTON	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0816	CLINTON	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0817	CLINTON	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0818	CLINTON	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0819	CLINTON	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0820	CLINTON	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0821	CLINTON	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0822	CLINTON	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0823	CLINTON	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0824	CLINTON	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0825	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0826	SANDERS	We have a lot of work to do.
0827	SANDERS	We have a lot of work to do.
0828	SANDERS	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against thenSenator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0829	SANDERS	I have no illusion.
0830	SANDERS	Of course you are right.
0831	SANDERS	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0832	SANDERS	Everybody knows that.
0833	SANDERS	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0834	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0835	CLINTON	...
0836	CLINTON	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0837	CLINTON	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0838	CLINTON	I said no.
0839	CLINTON	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0840	CLINTON	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0841	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0842	SANDERS	No, I think the idea was that president  thenSenator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0843	SANDERS	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0844	SANDERS	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0845	SANDERS	I think we should do both.
0846	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0847	IFILL	Let me move on.
0848	IFILL	You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya.
0849	IFILL	More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015.
0850	IFILL	Another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day.
0851	IFILL	Nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the Mediterranean.
0852	IFILL	And there are reports that 10,000 children are missing.
0853	IFILL	If we are leaders in this world, where should the U.S. be on this?
0854	IFILL	What should the United States be doing, Secretary Clinton?
0855	CLINTON	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0856	CLINTON	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0857	CLINTON	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0858	CLINTON	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0859	CLINTON	in particular.
0860	CLINTON	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0861	CLINTON	There is no other description of it.
0862	CLINTON	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0863	CLINTON	We have to stand with them.
0864	CLINTON	We have to provide financial support to them.
0865	CLINTON	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0866	CLINTON	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0867	SANDERS	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0868	SANDERS	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0869	SANDERS	And what a sad sight that was Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0870	SANDERS	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0871	SANDERS	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0872	SANDERS	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0873	SANDERS	So I believe that working with Europe  and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0874	SANDERS	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0875	SANDERS	They have a responsibility, as well.
0876	SANDERS	But I think this is a worldwide  that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0877	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0878	WOODRUFF	And we have a final question from our Facebook family.
0879	WOODRUFF	And it goes to Senator Sanders.
0880	WOODRUFF	It comes from Robert Andrews.
0881	WOODRUFF	He's a 40yearold stayathome dad in Dover, Massachusetts.
0882	WOODRUFF	He says, "The world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history.
0883	WOODRUFF	Can you name two leaders  one American and one foreign  who would influence your foreign policy decisions?
0884	WOODRUFF	And why do you see them as  why are they influential?"
0885	SANDERS	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0886	SANDERS	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0887	SANDERS	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0888	SANDERS	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0889	SANDERS	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0890	SANDERS	So what if children are going hungry?
0891	SANDERS	That's not the role of the government.
0892	SANDERS	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0893	SANDERS	And kind of  that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0894	SANDERS	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0895	SANDERS	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0896	SANDERS	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuitionfree.
0897	SANDERS	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0898	SANDERS	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0899	SANDERS	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0900	SANDERS	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0901	SANDERS	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0902	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0903	CLINTON	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0904	CLINTON	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0905	CLINTON	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0906	CLINTON	But I want to  I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0907	CLINTON	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0908	CLINTON	In the past he has called him weak.
0909	CLINTON	He has called him a disappointment.
0910	CLINTON	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0911	CLINTON	And I just couldn't agree  disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0912	CLINTON	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...[
0913	CLINTON	applause ]...who got us out of that...
0914	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0915	CLINTON	...put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0916	CLINTON	And it is a  the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0917	CLINTON	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0918	SANDERS	That is...
0919	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0920	SANDERS	...Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0921	SANDERS	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0922	SANDERS	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0923	SANDERS	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0924	SANDERS	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0925	SANDERS	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0926	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0927	SANDERS	But you know what?
0928	SANDERS	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0929	SANDERS	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0930	SANDERS	So I have voiced criticisms.
0931	SANDERS	You're right.
0932	SANDERS	Maybe you haven't.
0933	SANDERS	I have.
0934	SANDERS	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0935	SANDERS	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0936	SANDERS	That's what I said.
0937	SANDERS	That is what I believe.
0938	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0939	SANDERS	President Obama and I are friends.
0940	SANDERS	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0941	SANDERS	I have worked for his reelection.
0942	SANDERS	His first election and his reelection.
0943	SANDERS	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0944	SANDERS	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0945	SANDERS	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0946	SANDERS	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0947	SANDERS	I suspect you may have.
0948	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0949	CLINTON	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for reelection in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0950	CLINTON	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0951	CLINTON	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0952	CLINTON	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0953	IFILL	Senator, if you would like respond to  you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that.
0954	SANDERS	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0955	SANDERS	I was not that candidate.
0956	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0957	SANDERS	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0958	SANDERS	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0959	SANDERS	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0960	SANDERS	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0961	SANDERS	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0962	SANDERS	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0963	SANDERS	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0964	SANDERS	It ain't going to happen.
0965	SANDERS	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0966	SANDERS	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0967	SANDERS	Thank you all very much.
0968	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0969	WOODRUFF	Secretary Clinton?
0970	CLINTON	You know, we  we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0971	CLINTON	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0972	CLINTON	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0973	CLINTON	I am not a singleissue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a singleissue country.
0974	CLINTON	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0975	CLINTON	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0976	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0977	CLINTON	...the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0978	CLINTON	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0979	CLINTON	You're right.
0980	CLINTON	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0981	CLINTON	We would still have racism holding people back.
0982	CLINTON	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0983	CLINTON	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0984	CLINTON	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0985	CLINTON	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0986	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0987	IFILL	Thank you.
0988	IFILL	Thank you Senator Clinton.
0989	IFILL	Thank you, Senator Sanders.
