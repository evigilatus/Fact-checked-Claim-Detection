Paiden responded to a manager &apos; s question about his failure to obtain an extensive background check bill passed after the mass shooting of Sandy Hawk School in 2012. The recent polls we found showed that the majority of Americans supported the offensive arms embargo, but with a much smaller margin than Paiden mentioned. The 1994 Act prohibits the \"manufacture, transfer and possession\" of approximately 118 firearms models and all magazines carrying more than 10 rounds. The ban ended in 2004. Efforts to renew the embargo have not been successful, but Biden has pledged to advocate the embargo. The recent polls showed the majority support for the offensive arms embargo. We looked at the results of five surveys conducted after the mass shooting in early August in El Paso, Texas, Dayton, Ohio. We have limited our search to that period of time because the question posed by the moderator, David Muir, referred to the shooting of El Paso.

The survey found 90 per cent support for background checks of all arms buyers, including in private offers and sales. NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist: 57 per cent said that Congress should ban the sale of semi-motor assault rifles such as AK-47 or AR-15. The survey found that 83 per cent of the votes supported the request for background checks on weapons purchases at arms fairs or other private sales in the Washington Post/ABPB. 89% support requires background checks on all potential arms buyers Huff Post/Yogov: 59% prefer to ban offensive weapons and 81% prefer to check their background. We asked Paden's campaign for evidence, and we didn't answer it immediately. We wondered whether Bayden referred to the percentage of Americans who supported the expansion of background checks, which were 90 per cent on the field in many opinion polls. \"More than 90% of the American people think we should get assault weapons from the street.\" We looked at five surveys following the shooting in El Paso and Dayton in early August. These ballots showed general support for the prohibition of offensive weapons ranging from 56 per cent to 70 per cent. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00168"}
