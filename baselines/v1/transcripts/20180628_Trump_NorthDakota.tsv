0001	Donald Trump	Wow.
0002	Donald Trump	Oh, hello, Fargo.
0003	Donald Trump	Hi, Fargo.
0004	Donald Trump	We love you, Fargo.
0005	Donald Trump	What a place.
0006	Donald Trump	What a place.
0007	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0008	Donald Trump	This is an honor.
0009	Donald Trump	You know, I wish we could have had this stage back about 100 yards.
0010	Donald Trump	You'd see how many people.
0011	Donald Trump	This place is packed.
0012	Donald Trump	This place is packed.
0013	Donald Trump	The only thing more packed is outside, trying to get in.
0014	Donald Trump	They're having a hard time.
0015	Donald Trump	They can't get in.
0016	Donald Trump	It's full.
0017	Donald Trump	You know, we had the chance for a 24,000seat arena.
0018	Donald Trump	And we should have taken it.
0019	Donald Trump	The problem is, if we had two empty seats, we didn't quite get there, which will always happen, they will say, "He didn't fill up the arena.
0020	Donald Trump	He didn't fill it up."
0021	Donald Trump	Right.
0022	Donald Trump	That's what they'll say.
0023	Donald Trump	He didn't fill that arena up.
0024	Donald Trump	Twentyfour thousand seats.
0025	Donald Trump	No, we would have filled it up very easily, in retrospect, but that's OK.
0026	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0027	Donald Trump	I am thrilled to be here in the great state of North Dakota with so many hardworking American patriots.
0028	Donald Trump	Right?
0029	Donald Trump	And I want to congratulate  right?
0030	Donald Trump	We want to do this.
0031	Donald Trump	You know what I'm going to say.
0032	Donald Trump	I want to congratulate the North Dakota State Bison.
0033	Donald Trump	I shouldn't tell you this.
0034	Donald Trump	I shouldn't tell you this, but when I was coming out, they were talking about Bison.
0035	Donald Trump	I said, "I thought there was an s." They said, "It is.
0036	Donald Trump	But it's pronounced Bizon."
0037	Donald Trump	So, we didn't want to get that wrong, right?
0038	Donald Trump	But that is some  that is some great national championship team.
0039	Donald Trump	That's a great group of winners.
0040	Donald Trump	Winners.
0041	Donald Trump	We're honored to be joined by many of your wonderful North Dakota leaders.
0042	Donald Trump	Your governor, and a great guy, Doug Burgum, and his wife, First Lady of North Dakota, Kathryn Burgum.
0043	Donald Trump	Where are you, Governor?
0044	Donald Trump	Where are you?
0045	Donald Trump	Thank you, Governor.
0046	Donald Trump	Your former governor, Ed Schafer.
0047	Donald Trump	Ed.
0048	Donald Trump	Nice guy.
0049	Donald Trump	A friend of mine, who employs a lot of people, a very successful guy.
0050	Donald Trump	He puts a straw in the ground and oil comes out.
0051	Donald Trump	These big companies, they go out, they spend billions looking for oil.
0052	Donald Trump	They don't find anything.
0053	Donald Trump	Harold Hamm.
0054	Donald Trump	Where's Harold?
0055	Donald Trump	Where is Harold?
0056	Donald Trump	If I ever want to find oil, I'm going to call Harold.
0057	Donald Trump	Here's a straw, Harold.
0058	Donald Trump	North Dakota Republican Party Chairman, great guy, really helpful, Rick Berg.
0059	Donald Trump	Thank you, Rick.
0060	Donald Trump	A man who is so incredibly helpful, to me and to you, and to everybody.
0061	Donald Trump	A special person who works so hard.
0062	Donald Trump	I call him allaction, notalk, that's  don't we like that?
0063	Donald Trump	Allaction...
0064	Donald Trump	Senator John Hoeven.
0065	Donald Trump	He is fantastic.
0066	Donald Trump	And I also want to thank Kelly Armstrong, who's running for Congress.
0067	Donald Trump	He's going to win.
0068	Donald Trump	And Kelly, thank you very much.
0069	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0070	Donald Trump	Good guy.
0071	Donald Trump	We also have a couple of big supporters.
0072	Donald Trump	Do you ever see this guy with the pillows on Fox?
0073	Donald Trump	John?
0074	Donald Trump	MyPillow guy.
0075	Donald Trump	Mike Liddell.
0076	Donald Trump	Where is Mike?
0077	Donald Trump	He is the greatest.
0078	Donald Trump	I have never seen so many ads for so long.
0079	Donald Trump	And you know what?
0080	Donald Trump	I think he gets them for, like, peanuts.
0081	Donald Trump	First of all, he does make a great product.
0082	Donald Trump	Great pillows.
0083	Donald Trump	I actually use them, believe it or not.
0084	Donald Trump	But he's been  he's been a supporter from day one.
0085	Donald Trump	And I said, "You know, I want you to be my ad buyer."
0086	Donald Trump	Because I guarantee you, he makes great deals.
0087	Donald Trump	So, I haven't asked him yet.
0088	Donald Trump	Will you be my ad buyer, please, Mike?
0089	Donald Trump	The MyPillow guy.
0090	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0091	Donald Trump	And he's been with us right from the beginning.
0092	Donald Trump	Along with a lot of other folks, actually.
0093	Donald Trump	We've had a great journey together, and we are making progress like nobody thought possible.
0094	Donald Trump	Finally, the person we are all here tonight to support, a special person, an incredible person, the next United States Senator from the great state of North Dakota, Kevin Cramer.
0095	Donald Trump	Kevin, come out.
0096	Donald Trump	Good guy.
0097	Kevin Cramer	Thank you.
0098	Kevin Cramer	Thank you.
0099	Kevin Cramer	Thank you, Mr. President.
0100	Kevin Cramer	All I can say is, Mr. President, on behalf of all of the thousands of people in this arena, and the tens of thousands outside of this arena, who live in flyover country, thank you for not forgetting us.
0101	Kevin Cramer	And for all the farmers, and the manufacturers, and the families, and the energy workers, thank you for rolling back all of those regulations so they can not only keep their jobs but create more jobs.
0102	Kevin Cramer	And, Mr. President, on behalf of the middleclass working families represented in this room and throughout the heartland, thank you for cutting their taxes, so they can keep more of their hardearned money right here.
0103	Kevin Cramer	And, Mr. President, on behalf of the most vulnerable forgotten people, the unborn babies, thank you for standing for life.
0104	Kevin Cramer	Thank you.
0105	Kevin Cramer	And on these very important North Dakota values, you'll never have to wonder where I'll be, because I'll always be with them and with you, 100 percent of the time.
0106	Kevin Cramer	Thank you.
0107	Kevin Cramer	God bless you.
0108	Kevin Cramer	Welcome to North Dakota.
0109	Audience	USA!
0110	Audience	USA!
0111	Audience	USA!
0112	Donald Trump	I have got to tell you, that's pretty good.
0113	Donald Trump	That's pretty good.
0114	Donald Trump	He did good.
0115	Donald Trump	He loves you.
0116	Donald Trump	I will tell you that.
0117	Donald Trump	He loves this state, loves the people.
0118	Donald Trump	And we need Kevin Cramer to replace liberal Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in the Senate.
0119	Donald Trump	Going to happen.
0120	Donald Trump	It's going to happen.
0121	Donald Trump	When Heidi ran for office, she promised to be an independent vote for the people of North Dakota.
0122	Donald Trump	Instead, she went to Washington and immediately joined Chuck.
0123	Donald Trump	You know who Chuck is.
0124	Donald Trump	And Nancy.
0125	Donald Trump	And now they have a new leader.
0126	Donald Trump	Who's the new leader?
0127	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0128	Donald Trump	Maxine Waters is their new leader.
0129	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0130	Donald Trump	Maxine Waters.
0131	Donald Trump	I think she's taking over.
0132	Donald Trump	You know, they say, took.
0133	Donald Trump	I never believed I was taking over the Republican Party.
0134	Donald Trump	They say that to cause problems.
0135	Donald Trump	But Maxine Waters is taking over the Democrat Party, so.
0136	Donald Trump	Heidi voted no on the Obamacare repeal.
0137	Donald Trump	And, by the way, it was done.
0138	Donald Trump	It was done.
0139	Donald Trump	Unfortunately, she wouldn't vote.
0140	Donald Trump	And another person didn't vote.
0141	Donald Trump	We had it done.
0142	Donald Trump	Another person campaigned for eight years.
0143	Donald Trump	Repeal and replace.
0144	Donald Trump	And we were a little surprised when the thumb went down.
0145	Donald Trump	But we're doing very well.
0146	Donald Trump	You see what's happening.
0147	Donald Trump	We're coming up with incredible plans.
0148	Donald Trump	We've gotten rid of the individual mandate, which is terrible.
0149	Donald Trump	It's been gutted.
0150	Donald Trump	But remember this.
0151	Donald Trump	Individual mandate, where you have the privilege of paying a lot of money for the second privilege of not having to pay for not getting health care.
0152	Donald Trump	What kind of a deal is that?
0153	Donald Trump	So, you pay in order to not to have to pay, because you don't want the health care because it was no good anyway.
0154	Donald Trump	So, we have, though our Secretary of Labor, Alex Acosta, we just came out with the association plan, which is phenomenal.
0155	Donald Trump	Millions and millions of people are signing up.
0156	Donald Trump	And we're coming out with another plan with Alex Azar.
0157	Donald Trump	We are coming out with that plan in two weeks.
0158	Donald Trump	We are coming out with so many health care plans.
0159	Donald Trump	It is so much better than anything you've ever seen before.
0160	Donald Trump	Competitive.
0161	Donald Trump	And Obamacare is essentially dead.
0162	Donald Trump	I would have been happier with a nice yes vote instead of a no vote, but that's OK. We're doing great.
0163	Donald Trump	And probably we wouldn't have come up with these two other plans.
0164	Donald Trump	And it's actually three, now, other plans if we didn't.
0165	Donald Trump	You know, sometimes you work under pressure, and you do better, right?
0166	Donald Trump	I think most of the people in this room, under pressure, you end up doing better.
0167	Donald Trump	There are those people.
0168	Donald Trump	We want to know those people.
0169	Donald Trump	Heidi voted no on our massive tax cuts for North Dakota families.
0170	Donald Trump	She voted "no."
0171	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0172	Donald Trump	Not one Democrat voted to cut your taxes.
0173	Donald Trump	And the other day Nancy Pelosi said we have to raise your taxes.
0174	Donald Trump	What's that all about?
0175	Donald Trump	She wants to raise your taxes.
0176	Donald Trump	Heidi voted no on legislation to stop late term abortions.
0177	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0178	Donald Trump	Heidi voted in favor of the deadly, very, very dangerous, horrible sanctuary cities.
0179	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0180	Donald Trump	You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota but votes like they're from North Dakota.
0181	Donald Trump	That's what you need.
0182	Donald Trump	And that is Kevin Cramer.
0183	Donald Trump	So, a vote for any Democrat is November is a vote for Schumer, Pelosi, and Maxine.
0184	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0185	Donald Trump	Maxine.
0186	Donald Trump	She's a beauty.
0187	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0188	Donald Trump	I mean, she practically was telling people the other day to assault.
0189	Donald Trump	Can you imagine if I said the things she said?
0190	Donald Trump	We demand that he immediately drop out of the race.
0191	Donald Trump	Can you imagine, seriously, if I said that, or somebody else said that?
0192	Donald Trump	Horrible, what she said.
0193	Donald Trump	Now they want to censure her.
0194	Donald Trump	Let's see where that goes, folks.
0195	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0196	Donald Trump	Her own party was talking about censure.
0197	Donald Trump	Let's see where that goes.
0198	Donald Trump	Heidi was also against us from the very beginning of the travel ban, a commonsense policy to improve our vetting and our national security.
0199	Donald Trump	And I'm proud to report that, just yesterday, the Supreme Court upheld the travel ban...... and our authority to keep America safe.
0200	Audience	USA!
0201	Audience	USA!
0202	Audience	USA!
0203	Donald Trump	And, by the way  by the way, a lot of media back here.
0204	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0205	Donald Trump	If crooked Hillary would have won this election, and if she came here, which is about a zero percent change, after the election,... she'd have 200 people in a conference room in a small hotel.
0206	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0207	Donald Trump	You know, the saddest thing, we, I, we're making them rich.
0208	Donald Trump	They never had ratings like this.
0209	Donald Trump	You know, when the NFL is down 20 percent, it's the flag.
0210	Donald Trump	But it's also the fact that everybody is watching us on the different cable networks.
0211	Donald Trump	Because, frankly, they find this more exciting than the NFL, and a hell of a lot more dangerous, right?
0212	Donald Trump	And is there any better place to be on a nice, beautiful evening in North Dakota than at a Trump rally, right?
0213	Donald Trump	We're having a good time.
0214	Donald Trump	And I wish those cameras would circle the room to see how many thousands of people are here, because, you know, on the screen I look  and all you see are those few beautiful, wonderful people  I don't know who the hell I  but you've got a nice group over there.
0215	Donald Trump	I know you have Mike and some others.
0216	Donald Trump	They're going to be so famous.
0217	Donald Trump	But you see, like, that little group.
0218	Donald Trump	That's all you see on camera.
0219	Donald Trump	Would you please circle the room for the few honest...
0220	Donald Trump	Please circle.
0221	Audience	Trump!
0222	Audience	Trump!
0223	Audience	Trump!
0224	Audience	USA!
0225	Audience	USA!
0226	Audience	USA!
0227	Donald Trump	No, I just looked at the screen, and I said to my people, "How many people are here?"
0228	Donald Trump	They said, "Six thousand in the arena, but we're going to be  have to, unfortunately, walk 15,000 or 18,000 people that couldn't get in."
0229	Donald Trump	I said, "You've got to be kidding, because on the screen it looks like there's exactly 30 people.
0230	Donald Trump	What the hell is this?
0231	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0232	Donald Trump	The late, great, Cecil B. DeMille would not have set it up this way, I will tell you.
0233	Donald Trump	The travel ban ruling underscores just how critical it is to confirm judges who will support our Constitution, our great, great Constitution.
0234	Donald Trump	Justice Anthony Kennedy, a very special guy, also just announced a little while ago his retirement from the United States Supreme Court.
0235	Donald Trump	Great man.
0236	Donald Trump	And I'm very honored that he chose to do it during my term in office, because he felt confident in me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy.
0237	Donald Trump	That's why he did it.
0238	Donald Trump	And I'd like to take a moment to show our great appreciation for Justice Kennedy's lifetime of distinguished service.
0239	Donald Trump	Terrific man.
0240	Donald Trump	Service to our nation, and to the cause of liberty.
0241	Donald Trump	We were thrilled to appoint one of Kennedy's former clerks to the Supreme Court.
0242	Donald Trump	Did you ever hear of Justice Neil Gorsuch?
0243	Donald Trump	He's doing great.
0244	Donald Trump	He's a star.
0245	Donald Trump	And Justice Kennedy is a star.
0246	Donald Trump	And we appreciate it.
0247	Donald Trump	We really have to take our hats off to Justice Kennedy.
0248	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0249	Donald Trump	And remember this.
0250	Donald Trump	So, we have a pick to come up.
0251	Donald Trump	We have to pick a great one.
0252	Donald Trump	We have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years.
0253	Audience	Yeah.
0254	Donald Trump	We need intellect.
0255	Donald Trump	We need so many things to go.
0256	Donald Trump	You know, there's so many elements go into the making of a great Justice of the Supreme Court.
0257	Donald Trump	You've got to hit every one of them.
0258	Donald Trump	Heidi will vote no to any pick we make for the Supreme Court.
0259	Donald Trump	She will be told to do so.
0260	Donald Trump	Now, maybe, because of this, she'll be forced to vote yes.
0261	Donald Trump	Who knows?
0262	Donald Trump	But I will tell you she'll vote no the day after the election on everything.
0263	Donald Trump	Justice Kennedy's retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time.
0264	Donald Trump	The most important thing we can do. Democrats want judges who will rewrite the Constitution any way they want to do it, and take away your Second Amendment, erase your borders...
0265	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0266	Donald Trump	... throw open the jailhouse doors and destroy your freedoms.
0267	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0268	Donald Trump	We must elect more Republicans.
0269	Donald Trump	We have to do that.
0270	Donald Trump	And the problem is, in the Senate, we have 51.
0271	Donald Trump	We don't have enough.
0272	Donald Trump	We lose one.
0273	Donald Trump	If somebody gets a bad cold, let's assume they come in for a cold, but let's assume it's worse than that.
0274	Donald Trump	It's a very tough situation.
0275	Donald Trump	We need more Republicans, especially in the Senate.
0276	Donald Trump	We have to hold the House, and maybe even increase it.
0277	Donald Trump	And I think we'll be able to do it.
0278	Donald Trump	They keep talking about this blue wave.
0279	Donald Trump	Their blue wave is really sputtering pretty badly.
0280	Donald Trump	The red wave is happening.
0281	Donald Trump	Just look what happened last night.
0282	Donald Trump	Famous people.
0283	Donald Trump	Oh, they're going to be so famous tomorrow.
0284	Donald Trump	You were in that little group of people behind the president.
0285	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0286	Donald Trump	They're going to be famous people, those people.
0287	Donald Trump	You have a better location, but they're going to be famous.
0288	Donald Trump	Republicans want strong borders and no crime.
0289	Donald Trump	Very simple.
0290	Donald Trump	Not complex.
0291	Donald Trump	Democrats want open borders and crime, crime, crime happens automatically when you have those open borders.
0292	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0293	Donald Trump	The Democrats want to let the country be overrun.
0294	Donald Trump	Just take a look at what's going on.
0295	Donald Trump	Everybody comes in, including the vile gang, MS13, which Nancy Pelosi has gone out and wants to protect, OK?
0296	Donald Trump	We don't want to protect them.
0297	Donald Trump	Do you remember two weeks ago, you remember that.
0298	Donald Trump	Republicans love our military.
0299	Donald Trump	They love our vets and our police.
0300	Donald Trump	The Democrats are always fighting against funding for the military, and funding for law enforcement.
0301	Donald Trump	Figure that one out.
0302	Donald Trump	Democrats are now launching vicious smears against our incredible ICE officers and our Border Patrol agents.
0303	Donald Trump	Every single day the men and women of ICE and the CBP work long hours in the most dangerous conditions you can imagine, to defend our families, and to defend our communities, and to defend our borders, and defend us.
0304	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what.
0305	Donald Trump	You know, far fewer people are coming through, as much as I complain, coming through our southern border.
0306	Donald Trump	And now it's getting worse because we have so much opportunity here.
0307	Donald Trump	We have done so well.
0308	Donald Trump	And we want people to come into our country.
0309	Donald Trump	But we want them to come into our country based on merit.
0310	Donald Trump	Merit.
0311	Donald Trump	Not picked out of a jar.
0312	Donald Trump	And we're sending MS13 out by the thousands.
0313	Donald Trump	By the thousands.
0314	Donald Trump	We're liberating towns in Long Island.
0315	Donald Trump	We are sending MS13 out.
0316	Donald Trump	You know, our ICE officers, they're tough.
0317	Donald Trump	I have got to say it.
0318	Donald Trump	It's not nice.
0319	Donald Trump	But they're mean.
0320	Donald Trump	But they have heart.
0321	Donald Trump	But they go into these towns, in Long Island.
0322	Donald Trump	I grew up in Long Island, right next to Long Island.
0323	Donald Trump	And these are towns that I know all my life.
0324	Donald Trump	They're being liberated, like a foreign power has taken over the towns.
0325	Donald Trump	Our ICE goes in there.
0326	Donald Trump	They grab 'em by the neck.
0327	Donald Trump	They throw 'em in the paddy wagon.
0328	Donald Trump	We get 'em the hell out of our country.
0329	Donald Trump	And the Democrats are constantly complaining that we're too rough on ICE.
0330	Donald Trump	Do you believe it?
0331	Donald Trump	Do you see what they do?
0332	Donald Trump	Bing, bing.
0333	Donald Trump	Right?
0334	Donald Trump	You see what they're doing?
0335	Donald Trump	No, but do you see what they're doing?
0336	Donald Trump	They don't need guns.
0337	Donald Trump	They like knives, because knives are much more painful.
0338	Donald Trump	They cut people up in small pieces.
0339	Donald Trump	Beautiful young women, walking home from school.
0340	Donald Trump	And the Democrats complain that we're treating them too rough.
0341	Donald Trump	We're getting them the hell out, as I said, by the thousands.
0342	Donald Trump	Right?
0343	Donald Trump	Just days ago, a brave border agent was shot multiple times while protecting our border.
0344	Donald Trump	Every day, border agents are keeping drugs, crime, and gangs from entering our country.
0345	Donald Trump	We're going to get that wall built.
0346	Donald Trump	We've already started it.
0347	Donald Trump	$1.6 billion.
0348	Donald Trump	We're getting the wall built.
0349	Audience	Build that wall!
0350	Audience	Build that wall!
0351	Audience	Build that wall!
0352	Donald Trump	It's already begun, and it's beautiful.
0353	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what, they may not want to talk about it in California, but those people in San Diego are very happy with Donald Trump.
0354	Donald Trump	I'm building that wall, and they are so happy.
0355	Donald Trump	They are so happy.
0356	Donald Trump	In recent days, we've heard of shameless attacks on these courageous law enforcement officers.
0357	Donald Trump	Extremist Democrat politicians have called for the complete elimination of ICE.
0358	Donald Trump	We don't want ICE anymore.
0359	Donald Trump	You know what would happen to parts of our country?
0360	Donald Trump	It would be overrun with the worst criminal elements you have ever seen.
0361	Donald Trump	Leftwing activists are trying to block ICE officers from doing their jobs, and publicly posting their home addresses, putting these incredible people and their families in harm's way.
0362	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0363	Donald Trump	These radical Democrat protesters, they really want anarchy.
0364	Donald Trump	But the only response they will find from our government is very strong law and order.
0365	Donald Trump	We will not tolerate attacks on our law enforcement.
0366	Donald Trump	We will protect our law enforcement, like they protect us.
0367	Donald Trump	We will always stand proudly with our brave heroes of ICE, the Border Patrol, the sheriffs, the police, yes, the firemen.
0368	Donald Trump	The foremen sometimes are under attack, if you can believe it.
0369	Donald Trump	The firemen.
0370	Donald Trump	These are great people.
0371	Donald Trump	And we have their backs.
0372	Donald Trump	Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning again, and America is being respected again all over the world.
0373	Donald Trump	We're respected again.
0374	Donald Trump	All over the world, we're respected again.
0375	Donald Trump	You know, all those red hats and the white hats, Make America Great Again.
0376	Donald Trump	Right?
0377	Donald Trump	Make America Great Again.
0378	Donald Trump	And that's what we're doing.
0379	Donald Trump	And what are we going  what are we going to say in two and a half years for the next campaign?
0380	Donald Trump	It's called Keep America Great, exclamation point.
0381	Donald Trump	Exclamation point.
0382	Donald Trump	Keep America Great!
0383	Donald Trump	We gained $7 trillion in value, trillion with a "t".
0384	Donald Trump	Trillion.
0385	Donald Trump	I have wealthy friends, like Harold Hamm.
0386	Donald Trump	They don't even know what a trillion represents.
0387	Donald Trump	I say, "Harold, how many billion are in a trillion?"
0388	Donald Trump	And I'm not sure that Harold could answer that.
0389	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what.
0390	Donald Trump	We've gained tremendous worth, economic worth, and other worth, more important worth.
0391	Donald Trump	We're respected again, we're putting America first, we're making great trade deals.
0392	Donald Trump	$7 trillion.
0393	Donald Trump	Think of what that it.
0394	Donald Trump	And people don't realize this.
0395	Donald Trump	And we're going to get along with China.
0396	Donald Trump	And we're going to get along with the European Union, which has barriers from our farmers and our people, selling product into the European Union.
0397	Donald Trump	Last year, with the European Union, and we love the European Union.
0398	Donald Trump	We love the countries of the European Union.
0399	Donald Trump	But the European Union, of course, was set up to take advantage of the United States, to attack our piggy bank, right?
0400	Donald Trump	And you know what, we can't let that happen.
0401	Donald Trump	Last year, with the European Union, we lost $151 billion on trade.
0402	Donald Trump	We had a trade deficit of $151 billion, because they send the Mercedes in.
0403	Donald Trump	They send the BMWs in.
0404	Donald Trump	They send their products in.
0405	Donald Trump	We send things to them, they say, "No, thank you.
0406	Donald Trump	We don't take your product."
0407	Donald Trump	That's not the way it works.
0408	Donald Trump	And for all those free traders out there, that's not free trade.
0409	Donald Trump	That's stupid trade.
0410	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0411	Donald Trump	That's stupid trade.
0412	Donald Trump	So  so, I said to them, as the great Harold Hamm would say, because to him it's a natural thing, to some of the people in here it's a nat  because I know some of the people.
0413	Donald Trump	They're great business people.
0414	Donald Trump	I said to the, very simply, "Look.
0415	Donald Trump	If you treat us that way, and if you don't take down your barriers"  they call them trade  you know what they call them.
0416	Donald Trump	Nonmonetary barriers.
0417	Donald Trump	They're barriers.
0418	Donald Trump	Just like charging a big tariff, they charge us many times tariff.
0419	Donald Trump	If we send them a car which they don't want, and they practically don't take, but on the assumption it got through, they charge us many, many times what we charge them.
0420	Donald Trump	And I said, "Look.
0421	Donald Trump	If you're not going to treat us fairly, if you're not going to treat our workers, our companies, our farmers fairly, if you're not going to take our farm products like we take your farm products, then we're going to tax all of those beautiful Mercedes Benzes that are coming in, and we're going to tax BMWs that are coming in..."
0422	Donald Trump	... and we're already taxing, through tariffs, their steel and their aluminum.
0423	Donald Trump	And, by the way, do you see what's happening with our steel industry in the last four months?
0424	Donald Trump	It's booming again, folks.
0425	Donald Trump	It's booming.
0426	Donald Trump	United States Steel is opening up six plants through expansion and new.
0427	Donald Trump	I was in South Carolina the other night where, by the way, a great candidate won very easily.
0428	Donald Trump	You know, our track record is extraordinarily good, right?
0429	Donald Trump	That's why I'm here, for Kevin, that's why.
0430	Donald Trump	That's why I'm here.
0431	Donald Trump	But they just announced the day I get there, they have a steel company called Georgetown.
0432	Donald Trump	It's been closed for four years.
0433	Donald Trump	They announced the day before I got to South Carolina that Georgetown Steel is reopening and hiring 600 people.
0434	Donald Trump	Not so complicated.
0435	Donald Trump	We put tariffs on solar panels because China was flooding the market and it wasn't good stuff.
0436	Donald Trump	We had 32 plants.
0437	Donald Trump	Two were open and they were barely breathing.
0438	Donald Trump	They were mouthtomouth resuscitation.
0439	Donald Trump	We put a 30 percent tax on solar panels coming into the United States.
0440	Donald Trump	Now, those two plants are doing great.
0441	Donald Trump	And they're talking about opening at least 10, 11, or 12, and they'll probably have them all open very soon.
0442	Donald Trump	And they're going to make high quality panels.
0443	Donald Trump	And a lot of jobs.
0444	Donald Trump	Same thing with washing machines.
0445	Donald Trump	Sounds sort of tacky.
0446	Donald Trump	Washing machines.
0447	Donald Trump	Big business.
0448	Donald Trump	They were dumping, different countries  I don't even want to tell you this country because I actually like this country, but, you know, they all  sometimes our worst enemies are our socalled friends or allies, right?
0449	Donald Trump	But they were dumping washing machines.
0450	Donald Trump	We put a big tariff on, 30 percent.
0451	Donald Trump	We're now making washing machines back in our country.
0452	Donald Trump	But what else are we doing?
0453	Donald Trump	Think of it.
0454	Donald Trump	Just think, because you never hear this from the fake news.
0455	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0456	Donald Trump	What else are we doing?
0457	Donald Trump	No, what else?
0458	Donald Trump	We're creating jobs, number one.
0459	Donald Trump	And we're taking in billions and billions of dollars into our coffers.
0460	Donald Trump	You know, there was a time  there was a time when we had tariffs, because you had presidents like President McKinley and Roosevelt and others.
0461	Donald Trump	Roosevelt, one, who liked the idea of foreign countries, when they come in and want to take our wealth, they have to pay for it.
0462	Donald Trump	They don't take it.
0463	Donald Trump	On top of everything else, so they take our wealth, and we even protect them with our military.
0464	Donald Trump	We protect everybody.
0465	Donald Trump	So, we get it every which way.
0466	Donald Trump	So, we want to just tell those people, number one, we created a lot of jobs.
0467	Donald Trump	Number two, what's happening is we're taking in billions and billions  look at the steel.
0468	Donald Trump	We have a 25 percent tariff.
0469	Donald Trump	We're taking in billions of dollars, creating jobs, and  and, you know what?
0470	Donald Trump	Even if it wasn't perfect, we need a steel industry.
0471	Donald Trump	We were going to have no steel plants.
0472	Donald Trump	If something ever happened  if something ever happened, you know what I'm talking about, and we needed steel to make that something, we wouldn't be able to make steel.
0473	Donald Trump	We need  you know, there are some industries, steel and aluminum, we have got to have it.
0474	Donald Trump	So, we have jobs, we have a vibrant industry, in a short  the head of United States Steel called me the other day.
0475	Donald Trump	And he said, "Mr. President, I'd like to thank you.
0476	Donald Trump	I have never seen anything like it.
0477	Donald Trump	We haven't opened up a new plant in 32 years.
0478	Donald Trump	And now we're opening up seven of them.
0479	Donald Trump	Six of them extensions.
0480	Donald Trump	We're going to build a new one."
0481	Donald Trump	And that's just one company.
0482	Donald Trump	The Heritage Foundation reported that in just the first 500 days of our presidency  not my presidency.
0483	Donald Trump	It's our presidency, let's face it.
0484	Donald Trump	It's not my presidency.
0485	Donald Trump	You're the one that did it.
0486	Donald Trump	You're the one that did it.
0487	Donald Trump	Although I've been a good student.
0488	Donald Trump	I told John, and I told the whole group.
0489	Donald Trump	We had a whole group of politicians before.
0490	Donald Trump	And, you know, some of them have been congressmen, like, for 25, 30 years.
0491	Donald Trump	And they're asking me questions about politics.
0492	Donald Trump	I said, "I've only been doing this for two and half years.
0493	Donald Trump	Don't ask me a question like that."
0494	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0495	Donald Trump	But we've been good students, haven't we, altogether?
0496	Donald Trump	Haven't we been good students?
0497	Donald Trump	But the Heritage Foundation came out with a report, and this was as of two months ago.
0498	Donald Trump	We've already implemented 64 percent of our top agenda items.
0499	Donald Trump	And that's at a much faster pace than even Ronald Reagan.
0500	Donald Trump	That's pretty good, right?
0501	Donald Trump	And you don't hear this from the fake news.
0502	Donald Trump	We've created 3.4 million new jobs since election day, 3.4.
0503	Donald Trump	Unemployment  think of this one.
0504	Donald Trump	Unemployment claims are at a 45year low, and it's going to 63, I believe, probably, next month.
0505	Donald Trump	AfricanAmerican unemployment is at its lowest level in the history of our country.
0506	Donald Trump	HispanicAmerican unemployment also is at the lowest point in the history of our country.
0507	Donald Trump	Unemployment among women, women... remember, we were going to do so poorly with women.
0508	Donald Trump	Look at all the women here tonight.
0509	Donald Trump	Women for Trump.
0510	Donald Trump	They never take those cameras off my face.
0511	Donald Trump	Look at all the women.
0512	Donald Trump	Remember we were going to do so poorly with women.
0513	Donald Trump	We did great with the women.
0514	Donald Trump	If  I wouldn't be standing...
0515	Donald Trump	My wife told me, she said, "You're going to do great with the women."
0516	Donald Trump	It's hard to believe it, though, with the kind of press we get.
0517	Donald Trump	Do you agree?
0518	Donald Trump	But, you know what?
0519	Donald Trump	They are so smart.
0520	Donald Trump	And when they hear those numbers, they're happy.
0521	Donald Trump	And when you hear the numbers  I used to go into arenas, and I'd read the horrible statistics on crime and education, and how badly people are being treated in Hispanic communities, in AfricanAmerican communities.
0522	Donald Trump	And you remember, I'd go and I'd say, "You've been voting for Democrats for 100 years.
0523	Donald Trump	You have these horrible" look at my friends, right there.
0524	Donald Trump	Great guys.
0525	Donald Trump	My friends.
0526	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0527	Donald Trump	You've had these horrible, horrible statistics for years on crime and the educational abuse, and all of the things.
0528	Donald Trump	And I went in, and I'm reading them, point after point, and I'm seeing, and I'm  I looked out at the audience.
0529	Donald Trump	For 100 years they were with Democrats.
0530	Donald Trump	The Democrats felt they had automatic votes.
0531	Donald Trump	And I said to them, "What the hell do you have to lose?
0532	Donald Trump	Vote for me.
0533	Donald Trump	What do you have to lose?
0534	Donald Trump	What do you have to lose?
0535	Donald Trump	And I came off the stage.
0536	Donald Trump	I'll never forget it.
0537	Donald Trump	The first time I just said it.
0538	Donald Trump	I just said it.
0539	Donald Trump	I didn't care.
0540	Donald Trump	I  honestly, I want to say what's right.
0541	Donald Trump	I don't care.
0542	Donald Trump	I came off the stage and my political people said, "Sir, that's a horrible thing."
0543	Donald Trump	What's a horrible thing?
0544	Donald Trump	When you say, 'what the hell do you have to lose?'
0545	Donald Trump	That's a horrible thing.
0546	Donald Trump	I said, "But it's true.
0547	Donald Trump	What the hell do you have to lose?"
0548	Donald Trump	And now, I just said AfricanAmerican unemployment is at the lowest level in history.
0549	Donald Trump	Very, very good. Thank you,
0550	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0551	Donald Trump	.
0552	Donald Trump	Thank you. Thank you,
0553	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0554	Donald Trump	.
0555	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0556	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0557	Donald Trump	So, we keep going, and we keep striving.
0558	Donald Trump	And when it's all over, nobody's done the job that we've all done.
0559	Donald Trump	Wages are rising.
0560	Donald Trump	You know, for those of you that were with the campaign, which I think was probably about 130 percent of you...
0561	Donald Trump	... you would hear me talking about wages.
0562	Donald Trump	Where a person would have a job 21 years ago, 19 years ago from two years, where we were doing the campaign.
0563	Donald Trump	And they made more money 19 years ago, relatively speaking, by far, than they made two years ago.
0564	Donald Trump	And, actually, one year ago.
0565	Donald Trump	Their wages were going along, and they had one job.
0566	Donald Trump	And now they'd have two and three jobs.
0567	Donald Trump	They'd be working much harder and making much less money.
0568	Donald Trump	And now, for the first time in 22 years, wages are rising again.
0569	Donald Trump	And even more importantly than that is, you have a choice of jobs.
0570	Donald Trump	It's like the V.A.
0571	Donald Trump	We approved choice.
0572	Donald Trump	They've been trying to do it for 45 years.
0573	Donald Trump	Choice.
0574	Donald Trump	You have choice in a job.
0575	Donald Trump	But the vets  and you have great vets in North Dakota.
0576	Donald Trump	Vets, vets, vets.
0577	Donald Trump	So, remember, I used to say about the vets  and I wasn't a great student of the vets, but I'd read where the vets would be online for 13 days, 18 days, three weeks, seven days.
0578	Donald Trump	And they'd start off, and they wouldn't be in bad shape.
0579	Donald Trump	And sometimes it would take so long before seeing a doctor that they would be terminally ill.
0580	Donald Trump	Things that could have been taken care of.
0581	Donald Trump	And I said, without knowing anything  I thought it was the most brilliant policy I've ever heard.
0582	Donald Trump	I said, "Why don't they just go to a doctor, local, that's looking for the business, that would be a very good doctor.
0583	Donald Trump	We'll specify certain great doctors.
0584	Donald Trump	Go to a doctor.
0585	Donald Trump	Be taken care of.
0586	Donald Trump	And we will pay the bill, and it will be much less expensive, and you'll be all set, right?"
0587	Donald Trump	Right?
0588	Donald Trump	And I thought that was so brilliant.
0589	Donald Trump	I said, "Oh, I am so smart.
0590	Donald Trump	I am the smartest person."
0591	Donald Trump	My uncle was a great professor at MIT for 40 years.
0592	Donald Trump	Can you believe?
0593	Donald Trump	Forty years.
0594	Donald Trump	I said, "But I'm smarter than him.
0595	Donald Trump	I'm smarter than anybody."
0596	Donald Trump	And you know what?
0597	Donald Trump	I'll tell you.
0598	Donald Trump	I came in, and I said that to a group of people that are professionals and have been working with the vets for a long time.
0599	Donald Trump	They said, "Yeah, we know about that.
0600	Donald Trump	We've been trying to get it for 30 years.
0601	Donald Trump	We couldn't get it approved."
0602	Donald Trump	So, I was so disappointed, because I thought it was my idea.
0603	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what I was good at.
0604	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0605	Donald Trump	I was good at getting it done.
0606	Donald Trump	We got it done.
0607	Donald Trump	I signed it.
0608	Donald Trump	That's what I was good at.
0609	Donald Trump	I got it done.
0610	Donald Trump	We got it done.
0611	Donald Trump	They'd been trying to get it done for 40 years.
0612	Donald Trump	I was so disappointed.
0613	Donald Trump	I thought it was my idea.
0614	Donald Trump	That's the only problem.
0615	Donald Trump	I thought it was my idea.
0616	Donald Trump	And, you know, we have another thing.
0617	Donald Trump	Accountability with the vets.
0618	Donald Trump	The V.A.
0619	Donald Trump	 there was no accountability.
0620	Donald Trump	You'd have people that were protected, whether it was civil service unions, who cares.
0621	Donald Trump	They were protected.
0622	Donald Trump	You couldn't fire them.
0623	Donald Trump	They could be sadists, and we had sadists.
0624	Donald Trump	Sick people.
0625	Donald Trump	We had people that would steal and rob.
0626	Donald Trump	We had a lot of bad people.
0627	Donald Trump	We had people that didn't work hard.
0628	Donald Trump	And there was no accountability.
0629	Donald Trump	For 40 years they tried to get the V.A.
0630	Donald Trump	Accountability Act passed.
0631	Donald Trump	I got it passed.
0632	Donald Trump	And now, you look at the guy that did it, and you say, "Jim Smith, you've done a hell of a lousy job.
0633	Donald Trump	You're late, and you don't treat our vets right.
0634	Donald Trump	Jim, I'm sorry, you're fired.
0635	Donald Trump	Get out of here."
0636	Donald Trump	Right?
0637	Donald Trump	Right?
0638	Donald Trump	Jim, you're fired.
0639	Audience	USA!
0640	Audience	USA!
0641	Audience	USA!
0642	Donald Trump	So, those two things for the  I just approved them.
0643	Donald Trump	The accountability was a couple of months ago.
0644	Donald Trump	And John helped so much.
0645	Donald Trump	I'll tell you.
0646	Donald Trump	John helped so much.
0647	Donald Trump	He was a leader.
0648	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0649	Donald Trump	He was a leader on both.
0650	Donald Trump	And everybody said you couldn't get accountability done.
0651	Donald Trump	I said, "Why?"
0652	Donald Trump	Too much power, too many unions, too many people that just don't want it done.
0653	Donald Trump	You had people in Arizona that robbed $300,000 and they could  they agreed.
0654	Donald Trump	Everybody agreed.
0655	Donald Trump	They robbed the money.
0656	Donald Trump	They couldn't fire the people.
0657	Donald Trump	So now you have  accountability is done.
0658	Donald Trump	And I think even more important  I'm not sure.
0659	Donald Trump	But even more important, V.A.
0660	Donald Trump	choice.
0661	Donald Trump	So now you go see a doctor when you have to wait on line.
0662	Donald Trump	OK?
0663	Donald Trump	Optimism among America's great manufacturers has hit 95 percent, the highest number by far in the history of the survey, which is a very old survey.
0664	Donald Trump	We have eliminated record numbers of jobkilling regulations.
0665	Donald Trump	I think maybe as important as the tax cuts are the regulations.
0666	Donald Trump	Our country was choking.
0667	Donald Trump	And let me tell you, if our opponent, our wonderful opponent...
0668	Audience	Lock her up!
0669	Donald Trump	... when is she going to get over it?
0670	Donald Trump	When does she get over it?
0671	Audience	Lock her up!
0672	Audience	Lock her up!
0673	Audience	Lock her up!
0674	Donald Trump	Oy, when do they get over it?
0675	Donald Trump	But, you know, it is pretty amazing.
0676	Donald Trump	Point after point, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.
0677	Donald Trump	Oh, she's OK.
0678	Donald Trump	And then they go after us for a Russian hoax.
0679	Donald Trump	It's a witch hunt hoax.
0680	Donald Trump	It's  isn't it incredible, when you talk about a double standard?
0681	Donald Trump	When you talk about a double standard.
0682	Donald Trump	And nobody even looks at her.
0683	Donald Trump	Nobody even looks, I don't think, unless we're going to be surprised some day.
0684	Donald Trump	Well, we'll see how that works out.
0685	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what.
0686	Donald Trump	What's happened is somewhat of a miracle because we weren't expected to win.
0687	Donald Trump	But every time I'd go out, we'd have crowds like this.
0688	Donald Trump	We went to Michigan.
0689	Donald Trump	We went to Wisconsin.
0690	Donald Trump	We went to places that haven't been done.
0691	Donald Trump	I think Wisconsin was 1952.
0692	Donald Trump	Dwight Eisenhower.
0693	Donald Trump	And we won Wisconsin.
0694	Donald Trump	And Wisconsin, I went there, and I said, "I think we're going to win this state."
0695	Donald Trump	And people said to me, "Oh, sir.
0696	Donald Trump	It won't happen."
0697	Donald Trump	I said, "Why?
0698	Donald Trump	Look at the crowds we're getting.
0699	Donald Trump	Look at the people.
0700	Donald Trump	Look at the signs outside of the house.
0701	Donald Trump	Look at the signs."
0702	Donald Trump	I heard, and maybe it's not so, that Bill Clinton, President Bill Clinton, went back, and he went through Michigan.
0703	Donald Trump	And he said, "You'd better get some people out to Michigan, because there's a TrumpPence sign on every house.
0704	Donald Trump	You'd better get people out."
0705	Donald Trump	And they said, "Oh, no.
0706	Donald Trump	Our statistics show that Michigan cannot be won by the Republicans."
0707	Donald Trump	Well, let me tell you what's happened.
0708	Donald Trump	Car plants are moving into Michigan.
0709	Donald Trump	Jobs are moving into Michigan.
0710	Donald Trump	Michigan's very happy with your president.
0711	Donald Trump	They should have listened to Bill Clinton.
0712	Donald Trump	They should have listened.
0713	Donald Trump	And we just had our highest poll numbers.
0714	Donald Trump	And I watch these fakers back there, and they'll be talking.
0715	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0716	Donald Trump	Well, you saw the polls that come out  I don't know if this is true.
0717	Donald Trump	You know, a year and a half ago, they said I was an interloper.
0718	Donald Trump	How bad is that?
0719	Donald Trump	An interloper.
0720	Donald Trump	And now they say, and you will admit, a thing comes out, a big poll, and a couple of polls.
0721	Donald Trump	A number of polls that, "He's the most powerful, most popular, Republican in the history of the party."
0722	Donald Trump	And a little while ago I was an interloper.
0723	Donald Trump	They came out "more popular than" a man I like, Ronald Reagan.
0724	Donald Trump	Well  but think of it.
0725	Donald Trump	You go from interloper  that's a horrible term, right?
0726	Donald Trump	I was just doing my thing.
0727	Donald Trump	I'm not an interloper.
0728	Donald Trump	But we have tremendous  look at the people.
0729	Donald Trump	We endorsed Dan Donovan.
0730	Donald Trump	He was behind.
0731	Donald Trump	We endorsed him.
0732	Donald Trump	He won by, like, 24 points or something last night, in Staten Island, New York, and New York generally.
0733	Donald Trump	Dan Donovan, Congressman.
0734	Donald Trump	Last night we had a great evening because we watched that television and we were winning left and right.
0735	Donald Trump	They didn't know what the hell happened. And one of my biggest critics, a slovenly man named Joe Crowley, got his ass kicked...
0736	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0737	Donald Trump	... by a young woman who had a lot of energy.
0738	Donald Trump	She had a lot of energy.
0739	Donald Trump	I guess he didn't see it.
0740	Donald Trump	They couldn't find him.
0741	Donald Trump	He spent a lot of money.
0742	Donald Trump	He actually had a lot of money left over.
0743	Donald Trump	Everyone is pouring a fortune because they figure  and he was going to take Nancy Pelosi's place.
0744	Donald Trump	And I was so disappointed, because I want to keep Nancy Pelosi right where she is, with Maxine Waters.
0745	Donald Trump	I want to keep Nancy Pelosi.
0746	Donald Trump	Please, I want to make a plea to my Democrat friends.
0747	Donald Trump	Please, please, please don't remove Nancy Pelosi.
0748	Donald Trump	She should be where she is.
0749	Donald Trump	And please keep Maxine Waters on the air, as your face and your mouthpiece for the Democrat Party.
0750	Donald Trump	Please.
0751	Donald Trump	Maxine and Nancy.
0752	Donald Trump	So, I was disappointed in a way when he got beaten, because he was going to take her place, I think.
0753	Donald Trump	Now, he's just looking at us and saying, "Darling, what happened?"
0754	Donald Trump	Politics is a mean game, isn't it?
0755	Donald Trump	It's a mean  it's a fleeting game.
0756	Donald Trump	Six months ago, Republicans passed the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history.
0757	Audience	Thank you.
0758	Donald Trump	Our plan doubled the child tax credit, thank you to Ivanka Trump.
0759	Donald Trump	She wanted that so badly.
0760	Donald Trump	She really got to be a pest.
0761	Donald Trump	Dad, you've got to get child tax credit.
0762	Donald Trump	I said, "Darling, nobody knows what it is."
0763	Donald Trump	She said, "The women know, Dad.
0764	Donald Trump	The women know."
0765	Donald Trump	My daughter and my wife, Melania, they love  they love the women.
0766	Donald Trump	And the women love them.
0767	Donald Trump	The women love them.
0768	Donald Trump	And the men love them.
0769	Donald Trump	Child tax credits.
0770	Donald Trump	People don't talk about it that much.
0771	Donald Trump	It's very substantial.
0772	Donald Trump	And you know we got it for you.
0773	Donald Trump	We slashed taxes for working families, most of them in half, and saved our family farms and our small businesses by eliminating the estate tax in almost all cases.
0774	Donald Trump	It's known as the death tax.
0775	Donald Trump	And now, when you leave your small business or your farm, you leave it to your children.
0776	Donald Trump	Your children don't go  have to back.
0777	Donald Trump	They don't go to the bank, borrow money, and end up losing the farm or losing the business.
0778	Donald Trump	Thank Kevin and John and the whole group, they helped us a lot.
0779	Donald Trump	And guess what.
0780	Donald Trump	Heidi voted against it.
0781	Donald Trump	OK?
0782	Donald Trump	She voted against it.
0783	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0784	Donald Trump	Heidi voted against it.
0785	Donald Trump	And she's always going to vote against it.
0786	Donald Trump	And by the way, she may give us a couple of quickie votes, you know, before the election.
0787	Donald Trump	She might, because she has no choice.
0788	Donald Trump	But the day after that election, she's voting party line, 100 percent.
0789	Donald Trump	More than 100 utility companies nationwide have slashed prices for customers, saving them and this country much more than $3 billion, which goes and reduces your electric and utility bill.
0790	Donald Trump	Heidi and every single Democrat voted against our tax cuts.
0791	Donald Trump	We're also fixing the disastrous trade deals that have plundered our wealth, gutted our communities, undermined our great farmers, taken our jobs.
0792	Donald Trump	We are going to make trade fair and reciprocal.
0793	Donald Trump	Reciprocal.
0794	Donald Trump	You know what that is.
0795	Donald Trump	They do it to us.
0796	Donald Trump	We do it to them.
0797	Donald Trump	And we are placing very big tariffs on some of these countries, because they have tariffs on us.
0798	Donald Trump	It's incredible.
0799	Donald Trump	I wonder where these people come from.
0800	Donald Trump	Even politicians.
0801	Donald Trump	So, we'll have a country.
0802	Donald Trump	It doesn't matter.
0803	Donald Trump	I can almost name any of them.
0804	Donald Trump	They have massive tariffs on our people, on our workers, on our farmers, on our country, on our companies.
0805	Donald Trump	So, we say we're going to put tariffs on them.
0806	Donald Trump	And I'll actually have politicians and other people come to me.
0807	Donald Trump	Oh, please.
0808	Donald Trump	We want free trade.
0809	Donald Trump	How is it free trade?
0810	Donald Trump	I'll give you an example.
0811	Donald Trump	China.
0812	Donald Trump	If we make a car and sell it into China, they charge us a 25 percent tax.
0813	Donald Trump	That's what it is.
0814	Donald Trump	Twentyfive percent.
0815	Donald Trump	When they make a car and sell it into the United States, and there are a lot of them, we charge them the grand total of 2.5 percent, and they don't pay that.
0816	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0817	Donald Trump	And then when I want to raise the game and play the game of poker, a game that we can't lose, I'll get even politicians, mostly Democrats, but even a couple of Republicans.
0818	Donald Trump	They'll say, "We want free trade."
0819	Donald Trump	That's not free trade.
0820	Donald Trump	That's not fair trade.
0821	Donald Trump	It is so ridiculous.
0822	Donald Trump	Just play the game for a little while.
0823	Donald Trump	It's a game we can't lose.
0824	Donald Trump	You know, I've said a couple of times, when we're $500 billion down, they say, "Trump is starting a trade war."
0825	Donald Trump	I say no.
0826	Donald Trump	The trade war ended a long time ago, and the United States lost because our leaders didn't take care of our people and our companies.
0827	Donald Trump	So, we're not starting a trade war, but we'll finish it.
0828	Donald Trump	And you know what?
0829	Donald Trump	In the end, you know what's going to happen.
0830	Donald Trump	And it's already happening.
0831	Donald Trump	Already happening.
0832	Donald Trump	They're going to come to us, and they're going to say, "Hey, let's work it out."
0833	Donald Trump	And we're going to work it out.
0834	Donald Trump	It's very simple.
0835	Donald Trump	But remember  it is.
0836	Donald Trump	It's the art of the deal, but anybody can do the deal.
0837	Donald Trump	There are a lot of people.
0838	Donald Trump	This one doesn't get much simple.
0839	Donald Trump	Remember, it's true.
0840	Donald Trump	When you're $500 billion down, you can't lose.
0841	Donald Trump	You already lost.
0842	Donald Trump	But now we're going to start winning.
0843	Donald Trump	Or at least we're going to make it fair.
0844	Donald Trump	It doesn't even have to  we've got to make it fair.
0845	Donald Trump	And the fact that we've had presidents and we've had leaders that worked for those presidents, negotiators, trade reps, who were missing in action.
0846	Donald Trump	They weren't doing their job.
0847	Donald Trump	You know, I was dealt a lot of bad hands.
0848	Donald Trump	I was given North Korea where, frankly, we were very close to going to war.
0849	Donald Trump	You could have lost 30 million people, 50 million people.
0850	Donald Trump	Seoul is 30 miles off the border.
0851	Donald Trump	They have what they call cannons, like howitzers.
0852	Donald Trump	They have cannons, thousands of them, pointed.
0853	Donald Trump	I had the meeting.
0854	Donald Trump	We had a great relationship.
0855	Donald Trump	We had a great chemistry together.
0856	Donald Trump	The fake news was so upset when I said we had a good relationship.
0857	Donald Trump	We had a good chemistry.
0858	Donald Trump	They said, "That's a horrible thing."
0859	Donald Trump	No, no.
0860	Donald Trump	It's a good thing.
0861	Donald Trump	Getting along with countries, getting along with China, getting along with Russia, getting along with these countries is a good thing.
0862	Donald Trump	It's not a bad thing.
0863	Donald Trump	Not a bad thing.
0864	Donald Trump	And so, we have things cooking now.
0865	Donald Trump	You're going to be so happy.
0866	Donald Trump	But when people rush it  you know, it's like rushing the turkey out of the stove.
0867	Donald Trump	It's not going to be as good.
0868	Donald Trump	The women can tell me, and some of the men.
0869	Donald Trump	See, today I have to be politically correct. See, in the old days...
0870	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0871	Donald Trump	... in the old days I would have never  I just would have said, "Oh, I don't want to.
0872	Donald Trump	It's too hokey."
0873	Donald Trump	But it's true.
0874	Donald Trump	Some of the men can tell me, too.
0875	Donald Trump	Right?
0876	Donald Trump	Some of the men.
0877	Donald Trump	But here's what we do.
0878	Donald Trump	The more they rush, the worse it's going to be.
0879	Donald Trump	The longer we take, the better.
0880	Donald Trump	Your farmers, your people are going to be great.
0881	Donald Trump	You know, John  I'll tell you, John and Kevin gave me something.
0882	Donald Trump	They just told me this.
0883	Donald Trump	Canadian wheat markets consistently discriminate against the United States' wheat by grading it as feed.
0884	Donald Trump	Do you know what that means?
0885	Donald Trump	They know what it means.
0886	Donald Trump	I don't know what the hell it means.
0887	Donald Trump	I just know it's a bad deal.
0888	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0889	Donald Trump	But it's true.
0890	Donald Trump	Canada charges us on dairy products a tariff of 275 percent, for you farmers in here.
0891	Donald Trump	Two hundred.
0892	Donald Trump	That's like saying, "We don't want your dairy products."
0893	Donald Trump	It's no good.
0894	Donald Trump	That's like saying, "We don't want North Dakota, Wisconsin, New York State.
0895	Donald Trump	We don't want you there."
0896	Donald Trump	Two hundred and seventyfive percent.
0897	Donald Trump	And I actually hear that's an old number.
0898	Donald Trump	They raised it a number of months ago to 300 percent.
0899	Donald Trump	How horrible is that?
0900	Donald Trump	And then Justin gets up.
0901	Donald Trump	He said, "We fought World War I, we fought World War II," all true, "together."
0902	Donald Trump	All true.
0903	Donald Trump	We love Canada.
0904	Donald Trump	But they're taking advantage of us.
0905	Donald Trump	We can't let that happen.
0906	Donald Trump	We can't let it happen.
0907	Donald Trump	The era of global freeloading and taking advantage of the United States is over.
0908	Donald Trump	It's just over.
0909	Donald Trump	We're also restoring American security by rebuilding our military.
0910	Donald Trump	We've secured a historic $700 billion.
0911	Donald Trump	Just got it approved.
0912	Donald Trump	$700 billion.
0913	Donald Trump	We're rebuilding our military.
0914	Donald Trump	And next year, already approved, $716 billion.
0915	Donald Trump	We're rebuilding our military.
0916	Donald Trump	It will be bigger and stronger than ever before.
0917	Donald Trump	And hopefully we will never have to use it, because when it's bigger and stronger, you tend not to have to use it, OK?
0918	Donald Trump	And in addition to that, we got $6 billion for drugs and fighting opioid abuse.
0919	Donald Trump	$6 billion.
0920	Donald Trump	We believe in peace.
0921	Donald Trump	But it's got to be peace through strength, not weakness.
0922	Donald Trump	Peace through strength.
0923	Donald Trump	And I've directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, called the Space Force.
0924	Donald Trump	The Space Force.
0925	Donald Trump	Space Force.
0926	Donald Trump	Because space is the new frontier.
0927	Donald Trump	And I'm not just talking about going to up to the moon and going to Mars.
0928	Donald Trump	And I want the rich guys  you know, we have rich guys.
0929	Donald Trump	They love these rockets.
0930	Donald Trump	I said, "Lease them the land.
0931	Donald Trump	Charge them a lot.
0932	Donald Trump	They'll..."  they just want to send rockets.
0933	Donald Trump	But I look at it, with Bezos, with Elon Musk, they all love rockets.
0934	Donald Trump	I said, "That's OK. Let's do it."
0935	Donald Trump	Let them send a rocket up to Mars.
0936	Donald Trump	Let's be the first.
0937	Donald Trump	I hope they go fast.
0938	Donald Trump	Let's help them.
0939	Donald Trump	Let's make it really good for them.
0940	Donald Trump	And if they do it, we're going to claim it on behalf of the United States, OK?
0941	Donald Trump	We'll give them no credit.
0942	Donald Trump	Let them spend the money.
0943	Donald Trump	I think it's great.
0944	Donald Trump	But I have a lot of military guys.
0945	Donald Trump	And space, from a military standpoint, is really the new frontier.
0946	Donald Trump	So, we're going to have a Space Force.
0947	Donald Trump	Every day we are keeping our promises.
0948	Donald Trump	But to keep this momentum going, we need Kevin Cramer in the Senate.
0949	Donald Trump	All of us tonight are united by the same tireless values.
0950	Donald Trump	We have pride in our history, respect for our great, beautiful, wonderful American flag, right?
0951	Donald Trump	We put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance.
0952	Donald Trump	And we proudly stand for our national anthem.
0953	Donald Trump	Right?
0954	Donald Trump	Proudly stand.
0955	Donald Trump	In everything we do, we are standing up for our citizens.
0956	Donald Trump	We are standing up for America, and we are standing up for North Dakota.
0957	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0958	Donald Trump	The forgotten men and women of our country are forgotten no more.
0959	Donald Trump	No more.
0960	Donald Trump	They don't know where they all came from.
0961	Donald Trump	And by the way, our people, they call it the base, they used to say it's 35.
0962	Donald Trump	Then they said it's 40.
0963	Donald Trump	Then they said it's 42.
0964	Donald Trump	Then they have these polls go  we're driving them crazy.
0965	Donald Trump	Now they say it's over 50 percent And then they said  some great people.
0966	Donald Trump	They said, "Any time Trump gets a poll, add 12 to it."
0967	Donald Trump	Really.
0968	Donald Trump	And did you ever notice  I hate it.
0969	Donald Trump	I meet these people.
0970	Donald Trump	They call them the elite.
0971	Donald Trump	These people.
0972	Donald Trump	I look at them.
0973	Donald Trump	I say, "That's elite?"
0974	Donald Trump	We got more money.
0975	Donald Trump	We got more brains.
0976	Donald Trump	We got better houses, apartments.
0977	Donald Trump	We got nicer boats.
0978	Donald Trump	We're smarter than they are.
0979	Donald Trump	And they say, "The elite."
0980	Donald Trump	We're the elite.
0981	Donald Trump	You're the elite.
0982	Donald Trump	We're the elite.
0983	Donald Trump	So, I said the other day, "Let's keep calling these people."
0984	Donald Trump	And look, let's face it.
0985	Donald Trump	They've been stone cold losers, the elite.
0986	Donald Trump	The elite.
0987	Donald Trump	So, let's let them keep calling themselves the elite.
0988	Donald Trump	But we're going to call ourselves  and remember, you are indeed.
0989	Donald Trump	You work harder, but you are indeed smarter than them.
0990	Donald Trump	Let's call ourselves from now on the superelite.
0991	Donald Trump	We're the superelite.
0992	Donald Trump	We are the superelite.
0993	Donald Trump	You are the people who farm the prairies, tame the badlands, and squeeze oil out of rock.
0994	Donald Trump	Ugh.
0995	Donald Trump	You celebrate your heritage, and you live life proudly under the big beautiful skies.
0996	Donald Trump	And you have the big beautiful skies out here.
0997	Donald Trump	Loyal citizens like you helped rebuild this country and together we are taking back our country, returning power to the everyday, smart, brilliant, wonderful, hardworking American people.
0998	Donald Trump	We are standing on the shoulders of the American patriots who settled the frontier, scaled the Rockies, and won the American west.
0999	Donald Trump	These are great, incredible, strong tough, tough people.
1000	Donald Trump	This state was forged by pioneer men and women who braved the cold and tamed the wilderness to build a home on the plains and a life for their families.
1001	Donald Trump	And it's been an incredible life.
1002	Donald Trump	These North Dakota pioneers were tough as hell and they were strong and they were smart.
1003	Donald Trump	And they all had one thing in common.
1004	Donald Trump	They loved their families.
1005	Donald Trump	They loved their countries, and they loved their God.
1006	Donald Trump	They never gave up and they never, ever, gave in.
1007	Donald Trump	And neither will we.
1008	Donald Trump	We will never stop fighting for our country, our families, and we will never, ever, stop fighting for our freedom.
1009	Donald Trump	As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never ever fail.
1010	Donald Trump	With your help, with your voice, with your vote, we will win, win, win.
1011	Donald Trump	Like we're doing.
1012	Donald Trump	Remember how I started.
1013	Donald Trump	This country, our country, our flag, we are respected again.
1014	Donald Trump	All over the world they're talking about us.
1015	Donald Trump	Leaders from all over the world, they call me, or they come to the Oval Office, and they say, "Congratulations, Mr. President, on the incredible job with the economy, the incredible job you're doing with your country.
1016	Donald Trump	The fact that your country is respected again, congratulations, Mr.
1017	Donald Trump	President."
1018	Donald Trump	Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.
1019	Donald Trump	We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
1020	Donald Trump	And together, we will make America wealthy again.
1021	Donald Trump	We will, and are, making America strong again.
1022	Donald Trump	We will make America safe again.
1023	Donald Trump	Look at our military.
1024	Donald Trump	We will make our great, great America stronger and more powerful than ever before.
1025	Donald Trump	We will make America loving again.
1026	Donald Trump	Love it.
1027	Donald Trump	Love it.
1028	Donald Trump	We're going to come together.
1029	Donald Trump	And we will make America great again.
1030	Donald Trump	Thank you.
1031	Donald Trump	Thank you, North Dakota.
1032	Donald Trump	Go out and get Kevin Cramer in the  thank you, Kevin.
1033	Donald Trump	Thank you, everybody.
1034	Donald Trump	Thank you, North Dakota.
1035	Donald Trump	It's a great honor.
1036	Donald Trump	Thank you.
