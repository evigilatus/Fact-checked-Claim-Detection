Do you remember that?\"\n\nWe actually didn\u2019t, and when a reader asked us to fact-check it, we did. (She repeated the claim later in the interview.)\n\nWe looked in the polling archive of RealClearPolitics.com\u00a0and found four relevant polls during the month of April 2009. The approval ratings raged from a low of 26 percent approval to a high of 38 percent approval, for an average of just under 32 percent. So neither the average for April nor any individual poll within that month reached 40 percent, making Pelosi\u2019s statement incorrect. (Still, 38 percent is close.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s on somewhat firmer ground if you expand the parameters.\n\nIf you look at the months of March, April and May 2009, you\u2019ll find two polls with 41 percent support. Still, all the other polls during that period were lower, and the average for the 13 polls is 35 percent -- still short of the 40 percent mark that Pelosi cited.\n\nThis compares to the most recent three polls asking this question, which showed congressional approval below 13 percent.\n\nWe should add that if Pelosi wants to tout the public\u2019s approval of Democratic stewardship of Congress, the period she chose was clearly the high point of her tenure. Things went downhill from there. Within six months, approval ratings plunged to the mid-to-low 20s. Within about a year, approval ratings were often sinking into the teens.\n\nOur ruling\n\nStrictly speaking, Pelosi\u2019s incorrect: Congressional approval didn\u2019t hit 40 percent during the month of April 2009. Polls taken that month averaged just under 32 percent. But the rating did exceed that benchmark twice within the 13 polls taken in March, April and May 2009.
