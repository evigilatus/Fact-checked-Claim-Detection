Ami Bera, D-Elk Grove, was sentenced to a year in prison this summer for making illegal contributions to his son\u2019s campaigns for Congress in 2010 and 2012.\nRep. Bera, during a debate this week in\u00a0Sacramento against Republican Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones, his opponent in the race for the 7th Congressional District, said federal investigators found he had no prior knowledge of his father\u2019s illegal activity.\n\"The U.S. Attorney was pretty clear. They did a thorough investigation. They were consistent that I was never the target of this investigation,\" Bera said. \"They were consistent that neither I nor my campaign had any idea what was going on. And that\u2019s why they closed this case.\"\n\nRep. Bera makes his claim at about the 6:20 minute mark in the video above.\nMoments later, Jones took issue with Bera\u2019s statement:\n\"I disagree with the statement that the U.S. Attorney said they didn\u2019t know anything about it. I think what they said was they couldn\u2019t find any evidence to suggest Congressman Bera or his staff knew about it. And that\u2019s a difference.\"\nHad Bera taken statements by federal investigators out of context?\nWe decided to check the facts, with a focus on the portion of Bera\u2019s statement that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said \"neither I nor my campaign had any idea what was going on. And that\u2019s why they closed this case.\"\nOur research\nTo back up the congressman\u2019s claim, the Bera campaign pointed to statements by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in May and September.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what acting U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert said in a May news conference in Sacramento after Bera\u2019s father pleaded guilty to election fraud:\n\"To date, there is no indication from what we\u2019ve learned in the investigation that either the congressman or his campaign staff knew of, or participated in,\" the crimes by Bera\u2019s father.\nIn September, Talbert\u2019s office released a prepared statement saying \"no other charges will be sought in this matter\" and that it had concluded its investigation into the illegal contributions. It did not elaborate further on why it closed the case. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to address that question this week.\nOur ruling\nRep. Bera\u2019s statement that federal investigators said he and his campaign \"had no idea what was going on\" mostly matches with Talbert\u2019s May comments.\nStill, it\u2019s not entirely clear why the case was closed.\nWe don\u2019t know for sure without an explanation from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, which declined to elaborate on the subject.\nWhat we do know is Bera was investigated and no charges were brought against him. Bera\u2019s statement is not far from the mark.\nIt would have been completely correct, however, if Bera had repeated what the U.S. attorney said that there was \"no indication\" he or his campaign had any connection to the crime. His statement could have benefited from this key clarification.\nWe rate it Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ae0f519-815a-4e09-9a7f-4bdf3b53a80b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04107"}
