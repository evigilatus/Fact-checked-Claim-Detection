There are no \"documents,\" or any other sort of evidence, that support the theory that Trump is behind the creation of the coronavirus, which had killed six people in the U.S. as of March 3, 2020.\nThe video, narrated in a male voice, says \"top secret documents\" predict that a flu-like pandemic would strike America and kill millions of people.
