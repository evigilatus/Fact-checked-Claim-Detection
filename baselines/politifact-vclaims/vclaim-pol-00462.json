(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That\u2019s because they\u2019re not substantiated with facts.\nBig League Politics\u2019 article, which fact-checking site Lead Stories debunked July 1, consists mostly of quotes from the anonymous health professional. The lead photo is a stock image that the CDC frequently uses in its tweets.\nPolitiFact asked Howley for more evidence to back up his article, but he did not provide any beyond the anonymous source. He pointed to an old article that claimed a 6-year-old girl had been \"raped by 30 men\" at the U.S.-Mexico border as the basis for the claims. We rated that story False in December.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact that it has no record of any outbreaks of an unknown disease that has led to the quarantine of migrants in El Paso. The agency has previously researched that claim and found no evidence to back it up.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDC spokesman Bert Kelly told PolitiFact that the agency does not have anyone quarantined and \"is not aware of any \u2018unknown disease\u2019 along the border.\"\nThe Big League Politics story piggybacks off a legitimate recent news story. CNN reported last month that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had placed 5,200 adult migrants in quarantine after they were exposed to mumps or chicken pox.\nBut false claims about migrants with diseases at the U.S. border are common.\u00a0\nIn an April fact check, we debunked a photo that has been repeatedly taken out of context to stoke fears about immigrants. \"Disease-Ridden Congolese Migrants Dumped in San Antonio,\" the Conservative Daily Post website claimed in a headline last month \u2014\u00a0a claim that Big League Politics\u2019 story reiterated. We rated that False.\u00a0\nBig League Politics\u2019 about page states that its \"only goal is to tell the truth\" and that its staffers \"do not belong to the Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Green, or even Bull Moose parties.\" The website has more than 12,000 followers on its Facebook page and more than 90,000 on Twitter. But the site has published false and misleading political content in the past.\nOur ruling\nBig League Politics claimed migrants were being quarantined at a private hospital in El Paso with an unknown disease.\u00a0\nThat article was based on quotes from one anonymous source. Both U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told PolitiFact that they have no record of quarantines for an unknown disease affecting migrants on the U.S. southern border.\u00a0\nWithout evidence, we rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00462"}
