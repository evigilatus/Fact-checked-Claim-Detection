Handed an EBT Loaded with $1000, + $200 per child paid every month until their court date 5-6 years later. The Governor @GovMLG has a crisis and it\u2019s costing Americans,\" Kolfage tweeted June 9.\n\"\ud83d\udea8 ALERT \ud83d\udea8 New Mexico and maybe other states illegals are issued emergency welfare EBT cards with $1k a month +$200 for each child, for at least 5+ years until they see a judge. Illegals are asking agents \u2018when do I get my money. SOURCE: border agents.,\" he tweeted June 10.\nOn June 11, he tweeted a video of people rushing from one side of a fence to another; he described it as an \"invasion underway\" and said about 1,000 people had crossed at that location, \"all getting free emergency welfare from New Mexico!\"\nIs New Mexico giving immigrants in the country illegally Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards loaded with $1,000, per month, for at least five years? Not so, according to Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokeswoman for the New Mexico Human Services Department.\n\"None of these tweets are accurate,\" Porter said. \"It\u2019s simply unconscionable for Mr. Kolfage to spread blatant lies. New Mexico is fully in compliance with federal regulations and only issues benefits to qualified recipients.\"\nKolfage says information comes from Border Patrol agents\nKolfage told PolitiFact that his claim is based on what Border Patrol agents on the ground have told him. \"The agents said it\u2019s called emergency welfare and they bypass all rules,\" Kolfage said. He said that immigrants get the benefits for five to six years \"because that\u2019s the immigration backlog on court cases,\" but if they see an immigration judge in a month, they\u2019d only receive the benefits for one month.\nKolfage said the agents he spoke to were unwilling to talk to PolitiFact because they are not authorized by Customs and Border Protection to do so. The agency\u2019s press office declined to comment.\nKolfage on June 9 also tweeted a link to an April Breitbart post, authored by former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. \"U.S. law allows those who actually obtain asylum to qualify for federal welfare benefits, but now it appears that many asylum applicants may be getting them too,\" Kobach\u2019s post said. He also wrote that \"it appears\" that many immigrants paroled into the country are getting EBT cards before their eligibility period. His post doesn\u2019t specifically mention New Mexico nor link to data backing his claim.\nSNAP/EBT\u00a0restrictions\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federally funded program to help eligible, low-income families buy food. Benefits are provided through EBT cards that can be used at grocery stores. The U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees the program at the federal level and states administer it, following federal eligibility guidelines.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\"Expedited SNAP\" is an emergency program for very low-income families and migrant or seasonal farm workers; it allows eligible applicants to have an EBT card within seven days.)\nWe asked the USDA if it\u2019s true that in New Mexico and other states, \"illegals are issued emergency welfare EBT cards\" with $1,000 a month plus $200 per child, for at least five years, until they see a judge, as Kolfage tweeted.\n\"USDA does not have an EBT program like the one you described,\" said Mike Illenberg, a spokesman for the federal agency.\nGenerally, immigrants in the country illegally are not eligible for SNAP, and consequently cannot get an EBT card, several immigration law experts told PolitiFact.\nAside from U.S. citizens, \"qualified\" immigrants can be eligible for SNAP; and some must meet additional criteria. \"Qualified\" immigrants include people legally admitted into the country as refugees, people granted asylum by an immigration judge, and people paroled into the United States for at least one year. (State Department says parole is \"an extraordinary measure\" that is sparingly used.)\nKolfage\u2019s phrasing that the EBT cards are issued to immigrants until they see a judge suggests that this includes people seeking asylum whose cases are decided by immigration judges.\nBut the sole action of applying for asylum does not make someone eligible for SNAP. They are eligible for SNAP once they have been granted asylum.\nSome states offer state-funded food assistance to qualified immigrants who are ineligible for SNAP. But Kolfage tweeted about EBT cards that are part of a federal program.\nOur ruling\nKolfage said that in New Mexico, \"illegals are issued emergency welfare EBT cards with $1k a month +$200 for each child, for at least 5+ years until they see a judge.\"\nFederal food assistance benefits are distributed to eligible participants through EBT cards. New Mexico\u2019 Human Services Department, which administers the federal SNAP program, says Kolfage\u2019s claim is inaccurate. The USDA said it does not have a program like the one Kolfage stated.\nPeople granted asylum are eligible for SNAP, but solely applying for the immigration protection does not grant eligibility for the food program.\nWe rate Kolfage\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00528"}
