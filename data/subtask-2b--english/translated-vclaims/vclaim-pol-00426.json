There is a recent allegation in a text message that collected tens of thousands of shares on Facebook. He states that illegal immigrants have the ability to leave detention centres \"at any time\" they want. She says: \"No one states that the illegal is free to leave detention centres at any time to return to Mexico. They're not our prisoners.\" As part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast, an article 6 of July was announced. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found many repetitions of the claim on Facebook, mostly using the exact same wording. But what is at stake here is that the system that places migrants in detention simply does not work, as this allegation suggests. Voluntary departure is possible - but not automatic - for migrants detained in detention centres. But simply leaving \"anytime\" they want is not an option, the immigration experts told us. David Fitz Gerald, Co-Director of the Centre for Comparative Migration Studies, stated that \"some unauthorized migrants in detention are entitled to apply for \"voluntary departure\" during an expulsion hearing.\" He went on to say: \"The immigration judge must grant the application. The eligibility for voluntary departure is limited to those who have not been severely convicted, who have been in the United States for at least one year, and who are considered by the court to be \"good manners.\" If the application is granted, the migrant is repatriated. The judge shall set a time limit of up to 60 days for an immigrant to leave the United States and may apply for a bail registration. There are severe legal consequences for staying in the United States after the deadline.\" Theresa Brown, director of immigration and cross-border politics at the party politics center in Washington, D.C., said that Facebook's claim was \"unacute.\" On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher \u2022 January 16, 2021 \"If you're in custody, you can't just leave the centre,\" said Brown. \"If they are in the custody of the Government, they are not free to leave. They are detained and cannot leave the prison. If a person arrives at the port of entry to legally request entry into the United States and is told to be inadmissible, he or she may request the withdrawal of his or her application for admission and return. But this is not their absolute right; it is the government's appreciation... at that point in time, they can say: \"I just want to go home, but the government does not need to approve this request.\" Brown also said that since it would be easier for a migrant to return to the United States after leaving under conditions of voluntary departure, the Government might prefer to refuse the application. \"The government can say, \"No, we don't think that this person will really leave... so we'll process it for removal,\" said Brown. \"The basic legal point is that no person who is subject to American immigration or who is in a position where he has been arrested can leave alone without the government saying \"Yes, you can\" and this includes at the port of entry or not.\" The situation in detention centres is more complex than they suggest. \"In the context of zero-tolerance border enforcement policies, migrants arrested or surrendered in criminal proceedings for illegal entry are confronted. As such, they cannot return to Mexico, \"Suzanne Martin, an honorary professor at the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University, wrote in an e-mail. \"In fact, prosecutions are designed to prevent return without consequences to the migrant, especially if it means that migrants are given another chance to try to cross the border illegally.\" Martin explained that many of the migrants in detention were not in fact from Mexico, and they had no right to return to Mexico unless the country accepted them. Returning to other countries was complex and problematic, and some simply refused to accept the return of their citizens. We recently verified a similar statement on immigrant children by Michael Burgess, the Republic of Texas. After visiting a shelter in Walmart, recovered, Burgess said that undocumented children were \"crazy to leave\" the shelters at any time they wanted. And we evaluated that term half right. The shelters are not detention centres, so their employees cannot forcibly restrict children if they leave. However, if the child leaves, the operation requires law enforcement officers to contact and return the child to the facility. Our governor, Veral Facebook, wrote that immigrants detained in detention centres \"are free to leave detention centres at any time to return to Mexico. They're not our prisoners.\" This is a flawed argument - immigrants detained by the Government are not simply free to leave. Undocumented migrants living in the United States, as well as those detained in detention centres, can apply for voluntary departure. However, the United States Government has discretion as to whether such requests have been approved. The statement contains an element of truth but oversimplifies the ability of migrants to leave detention centres and ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00426"}
