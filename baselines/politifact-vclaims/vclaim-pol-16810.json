Elizabeth Warren called for student loan debt forgiveness after citing a startling racial disparity statistic.\n\"Today in America \u2014 a new study came out \u2014 20 years out, whites who borrowed money, 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt; 5% of African Americans have paid it off,\" Warren, D-Mass., said.\nThere are racial disparities when it comes to student debt.\u00a0\nBut Warren misstated these two figures.\nStudent debt at record high\nWarren has proposed that, for anyone making under $100,000, the federal government would pay off up to $50,000 of their debt. The government would also help people making up to $250,000, although on a sliding scale.\nStudent loan debt totals nearly $1.5 trillion, according to an August 2019 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That\u2019s as high as it\u2019s ever been and up about 200% from 2006, we\u2019ve found. It is a result of increases in both the number of borrowers and the loan balances they carry.\nAs for race, 17.7% of borrowers who live in black-majority ZIP codes default on their student loans \u2014 nearly double the rate (9%) of borrowers from white-majority areas, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a week before the debate.\nBut Warren\u2019s claim alludes to a September 2019 report from Brandeis University in Massachusetts.\nStudy Warren cites\u00a0\nThe major finding of the Brandeis study is this:\u00a0\n\"Twenty years after starting college, the median debt of white borrowing students has been reduced by 94% \u2014 with almost half holding no student debt \u2014 whereas black borrowers at the median still owe 95% of their cumulative borrowing total.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe problem here is that Warren talked about borrowers, whereas the statistic she tried to cite from the study talked about the amounts borrowed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Warren claimed that the study said that 20 years out, 94% of white borrowers had paid off their student loans.\u00a0\nBut what the study\u2019s measure of student debt actually found is that, 20 years after starting college, the median debt of white borrowers had been reduced by 94%.\n2. Warren claimed the study said that only 5% of African American borrowers had paid off their student debt.\nBut the study found that the median debt of black borrowers had decreased by only 5%.\nWe wondered about data for the borrowers.\u00a0\nThree student debt experts who were not part of the study pointed out another racial disparity finding of the study: 48% of white borrowers had paid off their student loans, compared with 26% of black borrowers.\nA Warren campaign spokesman acknowledged that Warren misquoted the study, saying the study is \"another alarming reminder of why we need to cancel student loan debt and close the racial wealth gap.\"\nOne of the study\u2019s authors told us that Warren gets right the broader policy point that there are racial disparities in student debt that should be addressed.\n\"In the important discourse concerning student debt and when race is added, Sen. Warren is right on the mark,\" said Tom Shapiro, director of Brandeis\u2019 Institute on Assets and Social Policy.\nBut, as we\u2019ve laid out, the way she stated it in the debate was wrong.\nOur ruling\nWarren said: \"Today in America \u2014 a new study came out \u2014 20 years out, whites who borrowed money, 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt; 5% of African Americans have paid it off.\"\nThere are racial disparities in repaying student loans, but Warren misquoted a Brandeis University study. It found that 20 years after starting college, the amount of debt of white borrowers had been reduced by 94%, versus 5% for black borrowers.\nWe rate Warren\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16810"}
