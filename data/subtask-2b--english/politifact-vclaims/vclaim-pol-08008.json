Democrats cite statistics showing a yawning pay gap between men and women, with Republicans countering that young women are out earning men in some urban areas.\nThe Claim\nThe National Partnership For Women & Families, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, released a new analysis April 8, 2014, to coincide with Equal Pay Day. It cited U.S. Census data showing that women who work full time in Oregon are paid 79 cents for every dollar paid to men -- a claim PolitiFact Oregon has investigated previously and found solid.\nBut it went further. If the wage gap were eliminated, it said, \"a working woman in Oregon would have enough money per year for 2,877 gallons of gas, 72 more weeks of food for her family or nearly 12 more months of rent.\nWe wondered if the specific pieces of the claim were on the money.\nThe Analysis\nThe basis of the group\u2019s claim comes from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey. It lists, state by state, median annual earnings for year-round, full-time workers and draws on statistics from 2012, the most recent year available.\nMen in Oregon earned $47,402, compared with $37,381 for women, according to the data. That\u2019s 79 cents on the dollar and adds up to a gap of $10,021 a year.\nThe gap persists for a variety of reasons, said Mary King, a Portland State University economics professor, including a gender division of labor under which \"women\u2019s jobs\" are paid less, lack of strong family-leave policies, and women disproportionately ending up in low-paying retail and service work.\nSatisfied that women do earn 79 cents for every dollar earned by men -- the gap would be 21 cents -- we emailed Sadie Kliner, the National Partnership for Women & Families\u2019 communications director. She directed us to a separate fact sheet.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGasoline prices, according to the sheet, were provided by Oil Price Information Service in cooperation with Wex, Inc. A gallon of regular gas in Oregon currently costs $3.697, it read.\nWe checked that against AAA Oregon/Idaho\u2019s website, which shows regular gas in Oregon right now averaging $3.69 per gallon.\nThen we did the math, dividing the wage gap of $10,021 by $3.69. The group claimed a woman could buy 2,877 gallons, but we found closing the gap would enable a woman to buy only 2,715 gallons.\nWe contacted Kliner again, who noted that Oregon\u2019s gas prices were $3.48 when the fact sheet was prepared in early March. A check of AAA\u2019s gas-price information confirmed Kliner\u2019s point.\nWe moved on to the 12 months worth of rent piece of the claim. The group, citing data from the Census\u2019s 2012 American Community Survey, put the median cost for rental housing in Oregon at $862 a month. It showed a margin of error of plus or minus 8 percent.\nIndependently verifying that number wasn\u2019t easy, since no county or or state organization tracks it. We called Multifamily NW, whose members manage more than 150,000 rental units from southern Washington to Medford.\nJonathan Clay, the association\u2019s research and communications analyst, pointed us to a semi-annual survey released in October. Two-bedroom, one-bath units averaged $818 per month across the metro area, according to the survey, putting it within range of the margin of error in the Census data.\nWe calculated that $10,021 would pay for 11.5 months of rent, just over half a month shy of the group\u2019s original claim of 12 months. Again contacting Kliner about the discrepancy, she noted that the group rounded the figure up, using the word \"nearly\" to account for the difference.\nFinally, in assessing food costs, we noted that the original claim said \"72 more weeks of food for her family.\" While the claim didn\u2019t specify the number of children, we settled on two. We then checked the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s website, which publishes monthly food plans representing a well-rounded diet at four different cost levels.\nDrawing from the low-cost plan, two children could be fed on $97.50 per week. Food costs for an adult female would bring the family\u2019s weekly total to $144.90. That compares with the $139.10 per week for the 72 weeks in the group\u2019s pay-gap claim.\nOur Ruling\nA national advocacy group, in spotlighting Equal Pay Day, claimed that a pay gap between men and women exists in Oregon.\nPolitiFact Oregon has looked at the gap before and found that it\u2019s real, but we took the next step by fact-checking the group\u2019s claim that the gap is big enough to pay for 2,877 gallons of gasoline, 72 months of food or nearly 12 months of rent. All three elements of the claim checked out -- or were very close -- according to independent sources. We rate the claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08008"}
