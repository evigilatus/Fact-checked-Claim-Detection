Use real people, not phony sources.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018\n\n\nReporters from multiple outlets began pushing back on the notion that the New York\u00a0Times had fabricated a source. The White House, they said, had actually furnished the source that Trump denied existing.\nThey said the official did indeed exist; in fact, he had conducted \"an off-camera, not for broadcast, background briefing on North Korea,\" in the wording of the White House email that had announced it on May 24.\nThe briefing had been held in the White House press room and was opened up to reporters elsewhere via a conference call line. Under the ground rules of a \"background briefing,\" reporters cannot use the name of the specific official and instead must use a more vague descriptor.\nThe New York\u00a0Times published a story after Trump sent his tweet, headlined, \"Trump Falsely Says Times Made Up Source in Report on Korea Summit Meeting.\" It said that the source referred to in the article \"was in fact a senior White House official speaking to a large group of reporters in the White House briefing room.\"\nMargaret Talev, the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, tweeted that she shared her \"colleagues\u2019 conclusion.\" \u00a0\nI share my colleagues\u2019 conclusion- the sr official whose existence the president disputes certainly appears to be same sr official who briefed 100+ of us in person and via conf call from WH. Brfng conducted on condition it be on bck with no audio/video distrib.\u2014 Margaret Talev (@margarettalev) May 26, 2018\n\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here? We did our own review. We found\u00a0Trump was wrong in saying that the source \"doesn\u2019t exist\" and was \"phony.\" Evidence shows Trump's own White House arranged the briefing with the official.\nDid the source exist?\nYes. This can be demonstrated by audio released on Twitter by Yashar Ali, a contributor to New York magazine and HuffPost. The clip offers the first minute and a half of the background briefing.\u00a0(The audio is actually video of the press room\u2019s empty lectern as it it records sound elsewhere in the room.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

I've obtained audio of the WH press briefing. You can hear Raj Shah, Deputy Press Secretary, introduce Pottinger (along with the terms - which are standard) and then Pottinger makes the statement that POTUS says was never made. Lots of reporters in briefing room and on phone. pic.twitter.com/2gEYkRSyTv\u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) May 26, 2018\n\n\nSome media outlets have not published the briefer\u2019s name, including many outlets who participated in the briefing and felt they were bound by the original agreement not to publish the name. However, other outlets have subsequently published the name made available in the audio Ali tweeted.\nPolitiFact will reprint the briefer\u2019s name for a few reasons: It is needed to full address the accuracy of Trump\u2019s charge; the information is now readily available on the Internet; and we were not a participant in the original briefing and did not agree to keep it on background.\nThe briefer was Matthew Pottinger, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Asian affairs.\nHere\u2019s a transcript of the audio segment Ali tweeted:\nWhite House press official: \"This briefing\u2019s going to be on background, off camera, not for broadcast. Pottinger here can be referred to as a senior White House official. He is deputy assistant to the president for Asia. And you can take it from here.\"\nReporter: \"Can you clarify that the president obviously announced in the letter that the particular time and date of the summit is called off. Later, he said it\u2019s possible the existing summit could take place, or a summit at a later date. Is he saying it\u2019s possible that June 12 could still happen?\"\nPottinger: \"The main point, I suppose, is that the ball\u2019s in North Korea\u2019s court right now. And there's really not a lot of time. We've lost quite a bit of time that we would need in order to \u2014 I mean there's an enormous amount of preparation that's gone on over the past few months in the White House, at State, and with other agencies and so forth, but there's a certain amount of actual dialogue that needs to take place at the working level with your counterparts to ensure that the agenda is clear in the minds of those two leaders when they sit down to actually meet and talk and negotiate and hopefully make a deal. And June 12 is in 10 minutes and it's going to be, you know \u2014 but the president has said that he some day looks forward to meeting\u2026\"\nThe White House declined to either confirm or deny to PolitiFact that Pottinger was the briefer. But the audio\u00a0speaks for itself.\nWhy Trump questioned the\u00a0New York\u00a0Times\u00a0report\nTrump's underlying issue with the\u00a0New York Times report might have to do with its\u00a0paraphrase of what the official said.\u00a0\nPottinger was certainly skeptical that a summit could happen on the original date, but he never actually used the word \"impossible\" \u2014 which is the phrasing the New York\u00a0Times\u2019 article had used.\nThe White House argues that Trump\u2019s incredulity is justified because, despite the New York\u00a0Times\u2019 characterization, nobody said in the briefing that a summit would be \"impossible.\"\nThat said, the New York\u00a0Times paraphrased Pottinger rather than quoting him, as Trump said in his tweet. That gives the\u00a0newspaper a bit of wiggle room.\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted, \"The Failing @nytimes quotes \u2018a senior White House official,\u2019 who doesn\u2019t exist, as saying \u2018even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.\u2019 WRONG AGAIN! Use real people, not phony sources.\"\nTrump is wrong that the senior White House official cited by the New York\u00a0Times \"doesn\u2019t exist\" and is \"phony.\" In fact, the official in question, Pottinger, gave an authorized background briefing to dozens of reporters in person and via phone.\nThe New York\u00a0Times article that Trump criticized may have gone too far by paraphrasing Pottinger as saying that a June 12 summit would be impossible, since Pottinger didn\u2019t use that specific word. However, Pottinger did express a significant degree of skepticism about the prospect of a June 12 summit.\u00a0\nIf that was Trump's gripe, it isn't what he said. The White House source did exist.
