(Just over half of the regional $6.14 billion list would go to mass transit projects, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported.) \n\nDirector Colleen Kiernan suggested in a radio interview that the state could fund more mass transit projects by using money from Georgia\u2019s gas tax. She said the tax, which helps fund area road and bridge work, has contributed to metro Atlanta\u2019s asphalt-focused development patterns.\n\nKiernan then made a claim about the gas tax that had PolitiFact Georgia ready to take a road trip in a search for the truth.\n\n\"Right now, we have the lowest gas tax of anywhere in the country,\" Kiernan told WABE-FM\u2019s Denis O\u2019Hayer.\n\nKiernan thought she said Georgia has one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation. She argued she should still get high marks from the Truth-O-Meter.\n\n\"It should definitely be on the green side,\" she said, arguing for a Mostly True rating.\n\nKiernan sent us a report by University of Georgia researchers on whether the state\u2019s motor use fuel tax collects enough revenue. The state\u2019s Transportation Department asked UGA to do the research. \n\nThe motor use fuel tax in most states is an excise tax, but several states impose an\nexcise tax, as well as a sales tax that is applied to the sale price of gasoline. \n\nGeorgia\u2019s excise tax is currently 7.5 cents a gallon. (Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price.) Georgia adds a 3 percent tax on sales of motor fuel that is classified as motor use fuel tax and a 1 percent tax that is received as general fund revenue. In 2008, the excise tax and both sales taxes combined produced an effective rate of 21.2 cents per gallon, the UGA report noted. About 17.8 cents per gallon is classified as motor use fuel tax, UGA said.\n\nThe UGA report, which came out in December 2010, said Georgia has one of the lowest excise taxes around, but Georgia is higher than most of its Southern neighbors if you include the sales taxes. \n\nKiernan also forwarded us a link to a February 2010 report by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization that does research on state and federal tax policy. The report showed Georgia\u2019s gas tax per gallon was 12.4 cents, which was the second lowest in the nation. Alaska was the lowest at 8 cents per gallon. \n\n\"Alaska is a different situation ... because they get so much of the revenue from oil and gas leasing,\" Kiernan said.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia also looked at a January 2012 Tax Foundation state-by-state breakdown of state tax and other gas taxes and fees. \n\nGeorgia\u2019s excise tax was the second lowest (only Florida was lower). Other taxes and fees pushed the Peach State into the upper half of states with the 18th highest gas taxes at 29.4 cents per gallon. But those other fees and taxes include various county gas taxes. Kiernan was talking about state taxes.\n\nAn April 2012 breakdown by the American Petroleum Institute had the same numbers for most states, including Georgia, as the January Tax Foundation report. The breakdown has a column that includes federal taxes, which are 18.4 cents per gallon in every state.\n\nKiernan erred a bit in what she meant to say on a radio show with a large audience. \n\nHer larger point is supported by several charts that show Georgia has one of the lowest excise gas taxes in the nation. Her statement could have been more precise.\n\nStill, under our rating system, she gets a Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11054"}
