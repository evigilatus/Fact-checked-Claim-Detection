And they said, \u2018He asked. He asked for help.\u2019 Right?\"\nTrump continued:\u00a0\n\"Russia, if you're listening\u2026 A very famous \u2014 they cut that thing so quick at the end because they didn't want to hear the laughter in the place and me laughing. It was just \u2018boom.\u2019 These are really dishonest people.\"\nJust like at the 2019 CPAC, where he used a similar line, Trump was not being honest about what happened July 27, 2016, at his Doral, Fla., resort.\u00a0\u00a0\nRELATED: Hillary Clinton claims Donald Trump invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to hack Americans\nWhat Trump said at his July 2016 press conference in Doral about Russia\nTrump\u2019s retelling made it sound like the Russia line happened at a big rally with \"25,000 people.\" But it emerged during a one-hour press conference at his Doral resort.\nTrump talked about Clinton\u2019s emails several times, and at no point did he indicate he was joking. (That excuse was televised the next day.)\n\"Russia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" Trump told a roomful of TV cameras and reporters (including this fact-checker). \"I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let\u2019s see if that happens.\"\nTrump delivered his comment (around minute 13:30 on the C-SPAN video) with a straight face. We didn\u2019t hear any laughter after what he said; it was news. The Q&A continued with Trump calling on a reporter who asked about the minimum wage.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 emails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.\"\nAnd when NBC reporter Katy Tur asked whether he was encouraging a foreign country to hack into emails, he said, \"Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.\"\nTrump tweeted a similar statement after the news conference (with still no trace of an LOL).\nIf Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!\u2014 Donald J.

Our job is to look for whether people laughed, and whether the media deceptively left that out (and neither happened).\u00a0\nThe same day as Trump\u2019s press conference, Russians launched their first email spear-phishing campaign of emails used by Clinton\u2019s personal office.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the media distorted his \"Russia, if you\u2019re listening\" comment in 2016 by cutting out \"the laugher, the joke.\"\u00a0\nThe laughter was not cut.
