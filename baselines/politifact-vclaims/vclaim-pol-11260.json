Leppert didn\u2019t go there, instead replying: \"The reality of it is that you have been a terrific staffer in the attorney general\u2019s office. But the reality of it is you haven\u2019t led businesses. So when you start talking about these issues, on how they impact business, to you it\u2019s really an academic exercise. To me, it\u2019s a career.\"\n\nHas Cruz never led a business?\n\nIn a telephone interview, Leppert spokesman Daniel Keylin told us that Leppert based his claim on Cruz\u2019s biography as presented on Cruz\u2019s campaign website.\n\nCruz says in the site\u2019s biographical section that he is now a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP in Houston, where he \"leads the firm\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice.\" From 2003 to 2008, the section says, Cruz was the state\u2019s solicitor general, leading state government\u2019s legal appeals before state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court. (Cruz was appointed to the post by Attorney General Greg Abbott, the state\u2019s chief lawyer.)\n\nFrom 2004 to 2009, \u00a0the entry says, Cruz also taught U.S. Supreme Court litigation as an adjunct professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law. And before that, the entry indicates, he held back-to-back federal posts and helped George W. Bush run for president.\n\n\"Prior to serving as solicitor general, Ted served as the director of the Office of Policy Planning at the Federal Trade Commission,\" Cruz\u2019s entry says. He earlier was \"an associate deputy attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice,\" according to the entry, after serving as \"domestic policy advisor on the 2000 Bush-Cheney campaign.\n\n\"In addition, Ted clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court,\" the entry says.\n\nWe asked Cruz\u2019s campaign if Leppert\u2019s claim about his not leading any businesses holds up. Spokesman James Bernsen pointed to Cruz\u2019s campaign biography.\n\nWe rate Leppert\u2019s claim as True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
