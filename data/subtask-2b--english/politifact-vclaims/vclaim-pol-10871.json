The Legislature divided the state into 12 regions to give residents choices of potential transportation projects that may best help their region, if they choose to do so. In a 10-county region that encompasses the city of Atlanta, its largest counties and other suburbs, the tax could fund 157 transportation projects if the referendum passes. The vote is scheduled for July 31.\n\nSome referendum opponents have a list as long as Buford Highway that outlines their objections to the plan. One reason they\u2019ve said they don\u2019t want it is they\u2019re not in favor of an additional tax across an entire region. They don\u2019t trust elected officials to spend the money as planned.\n\nDooley outlined those concerns and others at a June 12 forum organized by the Civic League for Regional Atlanta.\n\n\"We don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ve been fiscally responsible with the tax dollars they\u2019ve been given,\" Dooley said of elected officials in her opening remarks.\n\nDooley said she and others have presented some ideas to referendum supporters, but were rebuffed. She then talked about the gas tax.\n\n\"We support increasing the gas tax, which has not been done since 1991,\" Dooley said at the forum, Citizens for Transportation Mobility wrote in the press release.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s excise gas tax is currently 7.5 cents a gallon, the second lowest in the country. (Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price.) It has not changed since 1971, which Dooley actually said at the forum.\n\nCitizens for Transportation Mobility criticized Dooley\u2019s idea.\n\n\"We have been waiting on the opposition to come up with their \u2018Plan B\u2019 and we now see that they want to build more toll roads, raise gas taxes and take away the power of citizens to vote on a specific project list,\" said Che Watkins, campaign manager for Citizens for Transportation Mobility. \"We are frankly shocked that a tea party leader would advocate for higher permanent taxes with less public accountability.\"\n\nDooley actually said more than what was mentioned in the press release, a video of the meeting showed.\n\n\"One of the funding mechanisms we would look at once the gas prices came down to a manageable level is to increase the gas tax,\" she said.\n\nCitizens for Transportation Mobility spokeswoman Saba Long defended the organization\u2019s position, noting that Dooley didn\u2019t say how much lower gas prices must be in order for her to support increasing the gas tax.\n\n\"She\u2019s trying to have it both ways,\" Long said.\n\nDooley told PolitiFact Georgia gas prices must be $2 a gallon or less before she would consider supporting an increase to excise gas taxes.\n\nDooley did float the idea of raising the gas tax. But she said in the same sentence that gas prices must come down first. She also stated her distrust of elected officials with tax dollars. Neither was included in the press release.\n\nThe Citizens for Transportation Mobility statement was based on an accurate comment by Dooley, but it leaves out some important context.\n\nUnder our rating system, that is a classic Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVernon Jones\n\n\nstated on June 3, 2010 in a candidate forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Four years as a congressman, he [U.S. Rep.
