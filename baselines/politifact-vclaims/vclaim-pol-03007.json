The post had attracted 16,700 views through Aug. 11. So we decided to take a closer look.\nAs it turns out, the headline and some of the text in the article offered a garbled account of what had actually happened.\nJohnson, reportedly an independent, has indeed flirted with making a presidential run in 2020, though it remains to be seen how serious his is about a bid. In May, when he hosted the season finale of NBC\u2019s Saturday Night Live, Johnson joined with fellow actor Tom Hanks under a large banner reading \"Johnson Hanks 2020\" as confetti flooded the stage.\nJohnson talked about the growing buzz about a candidacy with GQ writer Caity Weaver in June 2017.\nWeaver wrote: \"Johnson doesn't hesitate when I ask him whether he honestly might one day give up his life as the highest-paid movie star on earth \u2014 which is unquestionably easier, more fun, and more lucrative than being president of the United States \u2014 in order to run for office. 'I think that it's a real possibility,\u2019 he says solemnly.\"\nThen someone took it seriously and filed papers with the Federal Election Commission -- but contrary to the Rearfront.com article, it wasn\u2019t Johnson.\nOn July 9, Kenton Tilford of Wheeling, W. Va., filed paperwork to formally establish \"Run The Rock 2020.\" It is what\u2019s known as a draft committee -- an organization created \"solely to draft an individual or to encourage him or her to become a candidate for federal office,\" according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paperwork says that the committee supports \"only one candidate \u2026 Dwayne Douglas Johnson.\"\nWhere the Rearfront.com item gets it wrong is when it says that Johnson himself has \"officially filed\" as a 2020 presidential candidate.\nThat is flatly wrong.\nThe paperwork itself clarifies Run the Rock 2020 \"is NOT an Authorized Committee,\" meaning that it was not established by the candidate being supported.\nThe Run the Rock 2020 website offers T-shirts for $20.20 to fund its grassroots effort. \u00a0\nTilford confirmed to PolitiFact that the Rearfront.com post \"is indeed incorrect.\"\n\"I have not been in touch with Mr. Johnson or his representatives,\" Tilford told PolitiFact. \"I'm simply a private citizen who formed a draft committee to rally like-minded people around the goal of encouraging him to run. As far as I know, Mr. Johnson and his representatives have not commented on the matter. We filed paperwork with the FEC because we hope to raise money and develop a real presence to show him the energy on the ground for his candidacy.\"\nThat explanation squares with what Tilford had earlier told several other news outlets that he has not talked to Johnson himself.\nAccording to his LinkedIn page, Tilford graduated from Knox College in 2012 and has worked on campaigns in New Jersey and Louisiana. He was also a field organizer for Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign in Clayton County, Iowa.\nWe did not hear back from two representatives of Johnson\u2019s camp.\nAs for the headline\u2019s message that The Rock is locked in for 2020, we rate that statement False.\n Share the Facts 2017-08-14 13:44:45 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Dwayne 'The Rock' (Johnson) Has Officially Filed For The 2020 Presidential Campaign\"    Rearfront.com Website   a web post Wednesday, August 9, 2017 2017-08-09    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03007"}
