(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It was more than 42,000 views.\nVideo evidence of Obama in jail sounds like a shocking scoop. But the footage Nelson shared doesn\u2019t show that \u2014\u00a0it shows Obama visiting the cell where Nelson Mandela was held during South Africa\u2019s apartheid government.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same clip was published by the Guardian on YouTube. It shows Obama looking around the cell on Robben Island\u00a0where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years. The Obamas visited the former prison in June 2013.\nWatch for yourself below:\n\nUnproven claims that Democrats will be arrested in the lead-up to Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration have circulated on social media over the past few weeks. They\u2019re related to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, which says President Donald Trump will soon announce mass arrests and executions of Democrats who\u00a0are part of an underground child sex trafficking ring.\nIf a former president were in jail, it would be big news. But we could find no evidence that Obama was arrested. We\u2019ve debunked several similar hoaxes over the years.\nWe reached out to the Obama Foundation for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19189"}
