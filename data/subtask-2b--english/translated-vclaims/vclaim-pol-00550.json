That's probably true.", "text": "Kamala Harris, the candidate for the Democratic Presidency, repeatedly attacked President Trump at the expense of his customs definition. Recently, she said they'd be a huge monthly tax on working Americans. \"Let's call it what it is. It's a trade tax,\" Harris claimed at the California Democratic Party Congress in San Francisco earlier this month. \"I like to call it the Trump Trade Tax. His trade tax takes $1.4 billion from workers' pockets each month.\" We reported this allegation earlier. But at first we didn't comment on it. Harris is not the only one who describes Trump's definitions as a tax. The same has been done by economists and tax reform advocates. By definition, definition is a tax or duty on a category of imports or exports. For example, the National Company Poletti Fact examined those paying customs duties on Chinese goods and concluded: \"In many cases, if not in most cases, these costs are passed on to American consumers, whether directly on products subject to tariffs or by influencing United States companies using raw materials subject to tariffs.\" In order to verify this fact, we wanted to know whether Tramp's actions cost what Harris claims. So, we focused on the second part of her statement, that tariffs \"take $1.4 billion in workers' pockets each month.\" Our research by the Senator is supported by a study in March 2019, entitled \"The impact of the 2018 trade war on prices and welfare in the United States.\" It was managed by the Economic Policy Research Centre, a think tank based in London. It concluded that \"usually, using standard economic methods, the full frequency of tariff falls on local consumers, with a decline in real United States income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\" However, it does not say that the effect was limited to \"employees.\" Stephen Redding, a author of the report and Professor of Economics at Princeton University, told us by e-mail that Harris' claim \"is a correct description of our research.\" \"The impact on the United States economy as a whole, involving all consumers,\" he explained. The Centre &apos; s study includes research carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank in New York and Princeton and Columbia universities. It reviewed all administrative tariffs imposed in 2018 on several countries, including China, on imports of solar panels to washing machines to steel and aluminium. The figure of $1.4 billion does not include any effect of the recent Trump threat of tariffs on Mexico. Devin Nunes reported on January 10, 2021 in an interview on \"The Republicans have no means of communication\" after the Barler tech companies were cut off. \u2022 On 13 January 2021, Harris, in his position on trade in Maclacchi this month, said that she was opposed to the free trade deal that Trump signed with Mexico and Canada last year, supplementing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of 1994 or the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). \"I'm not in favour of USMCA, what I call the North American Free Trade Agreement 2.0,\" she told News, referring to the agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. She said earlier that she wouldn't vote for the original Nafta deal, saying in an interview on CNN in April, \"I think we can do better to protect American workers.\" Harris also came out against the Trans-Pacific or Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-supported trade deal between 12 Asia-Pacific States, during the 2016 Senate race, which mentioned Maclatchi. Trump eventually withdrew the country from the Progressive Party after his election. Many economists who are not associated with the Economic and Social Council study on the cost of Tramp tariffs have told us that it is credible. \"It's a very reliable piece of work. At present, it is the specific economic assessment of Tramp's trade policies.\" Gary Hoffmann, his senior colleague, Peterson Institute of International Economics, said in an e-mail. The Harris statement might underestimate the impact of trump tariffs on households, pointing to a monthly cost of $3 billion mentioned in the report. The report's participant Redding described the $3 billion as an additional tax cost, \"a transfer from importers and consumers to the United States Government.\" He stressed, however, that $1.4 billion was the most appropriate figure to be used when referring to the impact on consumers, which he described as the \"cost of well-being (reduction of real income) of the United States economy as a whole.\" A spokesman for the Harris campaign quoted CCNBC.com as summarizing the study conducted by the Centre. Kamala Harris recently claimed that President Trump's tariffs \"take $1.4 billion in workers' pockets each month.\" In general, a study conducted by the Economic Policy Research Centre in March 2019 supports its claim. However, it notes that this was the effect for 2018 and that not all consumers felt only the impact of tariffs on workers. There is still no way of knowing the full impact of the President &apos; s definitions this year. We're mostly assessing Harris' claim.
