Jay Inslee has made fighting climate change the top priority of his 2020 Democratic presidential bid.\nIn a sit-down with CNN, Inslee touted his state\u2019s success in adopting renewable energy technology over a relatively short time span.\n\"We have done some good things,\" Inslee told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper March 10. \"We have developed a wind industry from zero to $6 billion in 12 years.\"\nInslee\u2019s claim about Washington state\u2019s wind energy investment was on the money. But if it sounds like Inslee is taking credit for it, it's worth noting he was governor for only a brief period during this build-up.\u00a0\nPricing wind power\nWe traced Inslee\u2019s stat to a fact sheet on Washington from the American Wind Energy Association. The AWEA fact sheet puts capital investment in the Evergreen State\u2019s wind industry at $6.1 billion through 2017.\nA footnote to that dollar figure states that the calculation is \"based on national and state averages.\" We weren\u2019t sure what that meant, so we reached out to AWEA and independent experts for clarification.\nDaniel Schwartz, a professor at the University of Washington and director of the Clean Energy Institute, walked us through how the numbers are crunched.\nA typical approach to estimating the value of wind investment in a given area begins by figuring out that area\u2019s amount of generating capacity, as measured in megawatts. One megawatt is equivalent to 1 million watts.\nFor instance, Washington state had 3,075 megawatts of wind capacity at the end of 2017, according to the Department of Energy, ranking it 10th in the nation. Texas blew away the rest of the country with 22,599 megawatts of overall wind electricity generation. Here\u2019s a nationwide snapshot from the most recent Department of Energy report:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of installing a wind turbine changes from year to year based on market forces. So arriving at a grand total of wind investment requires calculating the cost for each year, then adding up those annual figures.\nTo determine the cost of wind investment, you take the amount of megawatts of capacity added in a given year, and multiply that figure by the average cost for installed wind projects that year. Pricing data \u2014 measured in terms of dollars per megawatt \u2014 comes from the Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\"We use a national or regional average price per megawatt, rather than an actual price to acquire the generating capacity,\" Schwartz explained. \"That\u2019s because the actual contracted price each utility got from the vendor is not generally reported to the public.\"\nAWEA confirmed this was essentially their methodology to reach the $6.1 billion figure for Washington\u2019s total capital investment in wind farms\u2014all of which was built in the 13 years between 2001 and 2014. (They noted that the value is a bit higher if you factor inflation.) Inslee became governor in 2013.\u00a0\nAs for the time element of Inslee\u2019s claim, AWEA said the\u00a0state\u2019s investment in 2001 was relatively meager. So the governor\u2019s claim that the investment took place over 12 years is basically correct.\nA spokesman for the Department of Energy\u2019s renewable energy office said AWEA\u2019s numbers were in line with federal pricing data from the department\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. They,\u00a0too, noted the value is higher if you factor inflation.\nOur ruling\nInslee said, \"We've developed a wind industry from zero to $6 billion in 12 years.\"\nHis figure is backed up by the American Wind Energy Association and federal pricing data from the Department of Energy. The vast majority of Washington\u2019s wind energy capital was invested over a 12-year period, from 2002 through 2014. It's worth noting that Inslee became governor only in 2013.\nThe statement is accurate but needs additional information.
