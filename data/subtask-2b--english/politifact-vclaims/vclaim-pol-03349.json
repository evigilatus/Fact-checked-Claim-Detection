And thank God our congressmen made a deal last night to not go along with that. They actually increased funding by $2 billion.\"\nIs that what happened? Basically, yes. Kimmel has a point that by approving the increase, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress rebuked Trump\u2019s proposal and made clear a distaste for cutting NIH. Budget experts, however, may quibble that Kimmel oversimplified a bit on the numbers.\nFirst, some background. NIH conducts and disseminates research into the causes, diagnosis, prevention\u00a0and cure of human diseases. It is a collection of 27 separate institutes and centers, such as the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\nExplaining Kimmel\u2019s comment starts with the release earlier this year of the Trump White House\u2019s budget blueprint. While this proposal did not offer significant detail, it did include a cut for NIH. Specifically, the proposal would reduce spending for fiscal year 2018 by $5.8 billion compared to the fiscal 2017 level, through a range of reorganizations, consolidations and other changes.\nThat\u2019s short of a $6 billion cut, as Kimmel described it, but it\u2019s pretty close.\nFast-forward a few weeks to congressional negotiations over a bill to keep the government funded and avoid a government shutdown.\nUnder the agreement reached by lawmakers, NIH would see a $2 billion increase in its budget over the five-month period of extended federal spending. (That's on top of the funding that was already expected.)\nAccording to news reports, the agreement provides an additional $400 million for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and an additional $476 million for the National Cancer Institute, $120 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative, and an additional $110 million for the BRAIN Initiative, which aims to map the human brain.\nWhere Kimmel oversimplified matters is on the numbers. Specifically, the $2 billion increase did not directly replace Trump\u2019s $5.8 billion proposed cut -- the two actions are distinct, since they targeted two different fiscal years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would have been more accurate to say that the $2 billion increase directly rejected a separate Trump proposal to cut $1.2 billion from NIH for the remainder of fiscal 2017, which concludes at the end of September. (Remember, the $5.8 billion cut was to be for the 2018 fiscal year, not for the rest of 2017.)\nIndeed, the Trump proposal to cut NIH by $5.8 billion in 2018 is still officially on the table since Congress hasn\u2019t yet acted on spending for 2018. The agreement Kimmel cited only addresses a five-month extension of federal spending.\nThat said, Kimmel\u2019s overarching point -- that Congress effectively rejected Trump\u2019s proposal to cut NIH -- is on target, experts say.\nSteve Ellis, vice president of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, agreed that while Kimmel oversimplified the numbers, he added that the talk show host\u2019s \"overall message is accurate. The administration sought cuts and Congress boosted the funding.\"\nAnd the decision to protect NIH in the budget has been supported not just by Democrats but also by key Republicans, including the chairmen of the two chambers\u2019 health appropriations subcommittees, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., as well as Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.\n\"There is no appetite on the Hill for cutting NIH,\" Stan Collender, a budget expert at the consulting firm Qorvis MSLGROUP, told PolitiFact.\nOur ruling\nKimmel said, \"President Trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the National Institutes of Health. And thank God our congressmen made a deal last night to not go along with that. They actually increased funding by $2 billion.\"\nTechnically, the two funding changes Kimmel referenced are for different fiscal years, so Congress didn\u2019t precisely exchange the increase for Trump\u2019s proposed cut. But Kimmel\u2019s broader point is solid: The move by Congress to increase, rather than decrease, NIH\u2019s funding for the rest of the 2017 fiscal year is a signal that lawmakers are in no mood to cut NIH\u2019s budget by $5.8 billion once the 2018 spending bills are taken up.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-03 21:22:10 UTC   Politifact    2 1 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  \"President Trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the National Institutes of Health.
