That's an exaggeration", "text": "Former Trump Hispanic advisory council president Steve Cortes used a questionable statistic to portray Californian immigrants as a drain on government funds.\n\"We have right now, and this is not my talking point, per The L.A. Times,\u00a0in the state of California, 55 percent of all immigrants are on public assistance,\" Cortes said on CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett Outfront.\n\"Let's start doing it right,\" Cortes continued. \"Merit based. Control the border, allow the DACA people to stay. There is a reasonable compromise here.\"\nCortes referred us to a Los Angeles Times op-ed, not report, entitled \"Why is liberal California the poverty capital of America?\" We tracked the statistic back to a September 2015 study from Steven Camarota at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low-immigration levels.\nWe\u2019ve previously rated Mostly True the claim that \"half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system,\" also sourced back to this study.\nCortes said that 55 percent of immigrants in California benefit from welfare, but the CIS report looks at immigrant households. There\u2019s a distinction here, as immigrant households are defined as being headed by a foreign-born person.\nThe immigrant might not always be receiving the benefit, as with households in which a U.S.-born child qualifies for a benefit, while their undocumented or newly arrived immigrant parent does not. Undocumented immigrants cannot access most services, and a 1996 law restricts immigrants from public benefits during their first five years as a \"qualified alien\".\nWesty Egmont, director of the Immigrant Integration Lab at Boston College, added that California\u2019s more generous public assistance system means more people more receive aid than they would in most states.\nThe data comes from the 2012\u00a0Survey of Income and Program Participation, the latest and most reliable source of welfare statistics according to George Borjas, an immigration expert at Harvard University.\nWhen he ran the 2017 California numbers using the Current Population Survey, he found that 41 percent of immigrant households receive public assistance, whereas 24 percent of native households do. In 2012, 49.5 percent of immigrant and 25.3 percent native households received government assistance in California.\nGovernment assistance\nRandy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, said the report considers programs most people might not think as government assistance or welfare, including school lunches and Medicaid.\nSchool lunch is a nutrition program, and it\u2019s not always means-tested, so some schools in low-income areas provide free or reduced lunches to all students, Capps explained.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Medicaid is health insurance that goes with income eligibility that go way up beyond the poverty level in California,\" Capps said. \"They have workers in these families, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s an alternative to work, it\u2019s just that they have jobs that don\u2019t carry health care benefits.\"\nUnauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid, so Manuel Pastor, director of USC\u2019s Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration, questioned whether American-born children using Medicaid should be lumped into the category of immigrants receiving welfare.\n\"That\u2019s a key difference, because the policy alternative would be to tell U.S.-born kids who are the children of immigrants that they can\u2019t, for example, access the CHIP program,\" Pastor said.\nRemoving food assistance and Medicaid from the calculation shrunk the statistic significantly. Doing so showed 16.3 percent of immigrant households received cash benefits while 12.8 percent of native-born households did, and 6.1 percent of native households received public or subsidized housing, while 5.8 percent of immigrant households did.\n\"It would almost certainly reduce the share of households using welfare for both immigrants and natives,\" Camarota said. \"But, by how much I am not sure. Perhaps the rates would be something like 40 percent versus 20 percent.\"\nHouseholds v. Immigrants\nCamarota said he measured households because the income of all persons in a household determines if one can get TANF or SNAP, and other household members benefit if they don\u2019t have to pay for, say, a child\u2019s health insurance.\n\"Examining welfare use by households is, in effect, examining welfare use for immigrants and their kids versus natives and their kids,\" Camarota said. \"The key policy question is, can immigrants support themselves and their children?\u00a0High welfare use is an indication that they cannot.\"\nThe report does not correct for income, lumping in high-income native-born and immigrant households. Myungkook Joo and Jeounghee Kim took a closer look and\u00a0concluded\u00a0that poor immigrant families use less welfare than poor native families.\nOur ruling\nCortes said, \"We have right now\u00a0\u2026 in the state of California, 55 percent of all immigrants are on public assistance.\"\nThat\u2019s true of households but not individual immigrants, in 2012, a study found. The Current Population Survey found a lower amount, that\u00a041 percent of immigrant households in California relied on welfare.\nGovernment assistance is broadly defined to include school lunch and Medicaid. The discrepancy in what may ordinarily be considered welfare, like cash and housing assistance, was much lower between native and immigrant households in California.\nIn the absence of clearer definitions of public assistance and the distinction between immigrants and immigrant households, Cortes\u2019 claim exaggerates immigrants\u2019 drain on public coffers.\nWe rate this statement Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-01-29 17:47:49 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"We have right now, \u2026 in the state of California, 55 percent of all immigrants are on public assistance.\"    Steve Cortes Former Trump Hispanic advisory council president https://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1801/23/ebo.01.html   In an interview Tuesday, January 23, 2018 2018-01-23    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02477"}
