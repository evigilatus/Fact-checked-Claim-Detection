Biden favors small events and virtual options, while Trump still prefers to meet with supporters at large events that don\u2019t require social distancing.\u00a0\nThe Trump campaign has repeatedly said Biden campaigns from his \"basement.\" That isn\u2019t true. Now, social media users and one of Trump\u2019s sons are sharing misleading footage from a TV report to make it look like Biden held a campaign event, and no one showed up.\u00a0\nOn Facebook, a still photo grabbed from the report shows an empty road with \"Biden, Harris campaign event in AZ\" in the chyron. Text above the still says: \"Joe Biden and Kielbasa Harris held a joint campaign appearance in Arizona. The first since the Democratic National Convention. No one showed up. No one.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

They realize we are in a pandemic and they don\u2019t want a crowd of more than 50 people at any of their events,\" Garcia said in the report.\u00a0\n\"So, right now, here at the Heard Museum in central Phoenix meeting with tribal leaders, and pretty much all of the people that we saw enter into the parking lot, about 45 minutes ago, were with the Biden-Harris campaign and the pool reporters.\"\nEric Trump, the president\u2019s second son, retweeted a clip of Garcia\u2019s segment that was\u00a0 deceptively edited to remove the part where she talks about the campaign choosing not to invite the public to avoid drawing a crowd. The video has been viewed on YouTube nearly 50,000 times.\u00a0\nAfter meeting with tribal leaders, Biden and Harris delivered remarks in front of pooled national press members, which was live streamed, before launching their bus tour to meet with small business owners in the area.\nThe Facebook post\u2019s claim contains an element of truth \u2014 it did show a Biden-Harris campaign stop \u2014 but it ignores that the campaign didn\u2019t invite the public, or release any details about the event because of the pandemic.
