Asked at one point if he had enough money, McGuire playfully boasted: \"I have so much now, I don't even count it. I weigh it.\"\n\nNice.\n\nSatisfied smiles were harder to find in April 2013 when it was reported that the University of Wisconsin System, after years of tuition hikes, had accumulated reserves of $648 million.\n\nIncensed state lawmakers, primarily Republicans, suggested the system was so fat with cash, it needed a belt and suspenders to keep its breeches up.\n\nNot so, countered UW System president Kevin Reilly.\n\nDefending his institution to lawmakers April 23, 2013, four days after release of the state report that revealed the $648 million, Reilly asserted that the reserve is in the \"mid- to low-range\" of what comparable public university systems have.\n\nIn other words, it didn't weigh as much as the critics claimed.\n\nLet\u2019s see if he\u2019s right.\n\nThe system\n\nThe UW System describes itself as one of the largest systems of public higher education in the country, serving more than 181,000 students. It is made up of 13 four-year universities, including the flagship UW-Madison, 13 two-year campuses and the statewide UW Extension.\n\nThe system\u2019s total reserve revealed by the state report was $1 billion as of June 30, 2012 (a figure that has since been projected to grow by $150 million by the end of June 2013).\n\nOf the $1 billion, $648 million is unrestricted. That\u2019s the reserve figure that has received the most focus. The state report said the $648 million -- up 13 percent from one year earlier -- represents about one-fourth of the UW System\u2019s unrestricted budget.\n\nIn the wake of the lawmakers\u2019 furor over the funds, the Chronicle of Higher Education cited data from Moody\u2019s Investors Service saying the median amount of cash that university systems keep on hand is in that range -- 23 percent of their operation budgets.\n\nBut when we asked the UW System for evidence to back Reilly\u2019s claim, spokesman David Giroux provided data from a different calculation, saying it allowed for a better comparison of state university systems.\n\nReilly\u2019s evidence\n\nThat data compared the UW System\u2019s \"primary reserve ratio\" to the ratios at five state university systems that are among the institutions the UW System considers to be its peers.\n\nThe UW System said its 25 percent primary reserve ratio, as of June 30, 2012, equals $1.13 billion in expendable net assets divided by $4.5 billion in total expenses.\n\nThat put Wisconsin in the mid- to low range in the UW System\u2019s comparison of primary reserve ratios -- although Giroux acknowledged that the list of five institutions cited by the UW was not an exhaustive comparison, but rather utilized financial reports that were available online.\n\nHere\u2019s how they ranked:\n\n1. Texas: 95 percent\n\n2. Illinois: 34 percent\n\n3. Minnesota: 29 percent\n\n4. Wisconsin: 25 percent\n\n5. California: 21 percent\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Georgia: -5 percent\n\nWe asked three experts about those figures:\n\n\n\nEastern Michigan University accounting professor Howard Bunsis, whose specialties include governmental accounting\n\n\n\nSusan Menditto, director of accounting policy at the National Association of College and University Business Officers, which represents business and financial officers of more than 2,500 colleges, universities and university systems\n\n\n\nCertified public accountant Larry Goldstein, president of Campus Strategies LLC, a Virginia management consulting firm that serves higher education agencies and institutions, including the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee\n\n\n\nSome of the experts calculated different primary reserve ratios for some of the institutions; Bunsis, for example, calculated Georgia\u2019s ratio to be 18 percent, not -5 percent.\n\nNevertheless, the experts\u2019 1-to-6 rankings were the same as the rankings put out by the UW System. \u00a0\n\nThat would appear to back Reilly\u2019s claim that the UW System is in the middle to low range among its peers in terms of cash reserves.\n\nBut let\u2019s take a closer look at the measure the UW System used. And let\u2019s do a broader comparison.\n\nPrimary reserve ratio\n\nAll three experts agreed the primary reserve ratio is an important and commonly used ratio for determining a university system\u2019s financial strength.\n\nThey said Wisconsin\u2019s ratio of 25 percent indicates that, if the UW System\u2019s income were cut off, it would have enough reserves or \"expendable assets\" to meet its expenses for three months -- three months being 25 percent of one year.\n\n(What is an appropriate level of cash reserves, of course, is in the eye of the beholder and doesn\u2019t relate to the Reilly claim we\u2019re fact checking. But we\u2019ll note that Bunsis said a primary reserve ratio of 15 to 20 percent is considered prudent, 40 percent \"very solid\" and anything over 50 percent high. Menditto cited a consultant\u2019s report that said 40 percent is advisable.)\n\n\"Peer institutions\"\n\nThe question of which university systems the UW System should be compared to is trickier.\n\nUnfortunately, the experts told us, there is no large compilation of university systems\u2019 primary reserve ratios. And there are other issues: the experts didn\u2019t necessarily agree that the Illinois, Minnesota, California and Texas state systems, because of their makeup, were truly peers of Wisconsin; and some systems that could be comparable, such as Ohio and North Carolina, produce consolidated financial statements at the campus level, but not the system level.\n\nWe were able, however, to find primary reserve ratios for three other state systems that can be compared to Wisconsin\u2019s.\n\nGoldstein, the Virginia consultant, said Maryland, though a smaller state university system, is a peer of Wisconsin; and indeed the UW System considers it a peer, Giroux told us. Goldstein said Maryland\u2019s primary reserve ratio is 37 percent.\n\nThe UW System also has long considered the State University of New York system as being a peer and Goldstein agreed. Goldstein told us that, like Georgia, SUNY has a negative primary reserve ratio -16 percent.\n\nAnd while the UW System doesn\u2019t consider the Nebraska state system as among its peers, Nebraska system considers Wisconsin as one of its peers. Goldstein said Nebraska\u2019s primary reserve ratio is 67 percent.\n\nSo, here\u2019s how that list looks:\n\n1. Nebraska: 67 percent\n\n2. Maryland: 37 percent\n\n3. Wisconsin: 25 percent\n\n4. SUNY: -16 percent\n\nOur rating\n\nReilly said UW System's reserves are in the \"mid- to low-range\" of comparable university systems, as though that fact has been clearly established.\n\nUsing a key measure, Wisconsin\u2019s level of reserves is below that of some of its peers. But there is debate about whether some of the state systems the UW System considers to be peers are in fact peers. And figures simply aren\u2019t available for other peer systems.\n\nWith the evidence available, we find Reilly\u2019s statement partially accurate but missing important details -- our definition of Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09359"}
