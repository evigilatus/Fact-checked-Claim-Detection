It left many people wondering if Trump was softening or hardening his immigration policies.\nThat was the topic for Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who took questions about his running mate on Meet the Press. \u00a0\nHost Chuck Todd pointed out that Trump has been inconsistent on what to do with approximately 11 million people living in the United States illegally, specifically those who haven\u2019t committed violent crime. Trump has said violent criminals should be deported, a position that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also holds.\nTodd noted that Trump\u2019s position on what to do with nonviolent immigrants isn\u2019t clear.\n\"I think Donald Trump\u2019s been completely consistent,\" Pence countered. \"And I think he did answer the question.\"\nTodd pressed Pence with more questioning, noting that Latino leaders were concerned about Trump\u2019s policies and what they actually were. But Pence didn\u2019t directly answer.\nWe looked in depth at Trump\u2019s statements about the undocumented and found that Trump\u2019s answers have not been consistent. At times Trump has been vague, and at other times he\u2019s contradicted himself. His current position seems to be one of wait and see.\nNo official position\nBefore he jumped into the presidential race, Trump seemed to advocate for a pathway to citizenship, not deportation, and repeatedly implied that immigration reform was \"what\u2019s right.\" But he warned that it wouldn\u2019t help the Republican Party.\n\"Every one of those (11 million) votes goes to the Democrats. Now with that, you have to do what\u2019s right, you have to do what\u2019s right. It\u2019s not about the votes necessarily,\" he said in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference of 2014. \"So with immigration, you better be smart and you better be tough.\"\nAs a presidential candidate, Trump has advocated the \"return of all criminal aliens,\" detention of those crossing the border and enhanced penalties for visa overstays. (Snapshots show his position page hasn\u2019t changed since September 2015, when his campaign website launched.)\nBut the position page makes no mention of the undocumented population at large and, in comments throughout this election, he\u2019s floated several different proposals. Let\u2019s run through them.\nProposal No. 1: \u2018Have to give them a path\u2019\nA few days after he announced his candidacy, Trump suggested he was open to a pathway to citizenship.\n\"You have to give them a path, and you have to make it possible for them to succeed. But the bad ones, you have to get them out and get them out fast,\" Trump said in a July 3, 2015, press conference.\nProposal No. 2: Mass deportations and expedited legal return\nDuring most of the GOP primary, Trump consistently advocated for deporting all undocumented immigrants, but allowing some to return through an expedited legal process.\nHe didn\u2019t give details on how he would pay for and implement the deportations, but remained committed to his position and criticized primary opponents for being weak on the issue and promising \"amnesty.\"\nHere are some examples of comments Trump made during that period:\n\u2022 Sept. 27, 2015, CBS: \"If they\u2019ve done well, they\u2019re going out and they\u2019re coming back in legally. ...We\u2019re rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they\u2019re going to be happy because they want to be legalized.\"\n\u2022 Nov. 11, 2015, MSNBC: \"You\u2019re going to have a deportation force, and you\u2019re going to do it humanely. ... Now they can come back but they have to come back legally.\"\n\u2022 Feb. 25, 2016, CNN/Telemundo GOP primary debate: \"We either have a country, or we don\u2019t have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back \u2014 some will come back, the best, through a process.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposal No. 3: No mass deportations and \u2018we work with them\u2019\nAfter winning the GOP primary, Trump seemed to walk back his previous calls for removing all of the 11 million undocumented immigrants.\nHe told Bloomberg in a June 2016 interview that his immigration policies would have \"heart.\" Pressed to clarify his earlier deportation position, he said, \"No, I wouldn\u2019t call it mass deportations. \u2026 We are going to get rid of a lot of bad dudes who are here, that I can tell you.\"\n\"I never liked the media term \u2018mass deportation\u2019 \u2014 but we must enforce the laws of the land!\" he tweeted the same day.\nTrump reiterated this position in a Aug. 23 Fox News town hall. Asked whether he would accommodate law-abiding undocumented immigrants with families, he said, \"There certainly can be a softening, because we\u2019re not looking to hurt people, we want people \u2014 we have some great people in this country. We have some great people in this country. So, but we\u2019re going to follow the laws of this country.\"\nIn a follow-up town hall that aired a night later, Trump asked his supporters to indicate via applause what he should do with the noncriminal immigrants: \"No. 1, we\u2019ll say throw them out. No. 2, we work with them.\"\n\"They\u2019ll pay back taxes. They have to pay taxes. There\u2019s no amnesty,\" Trump said following the voice vote. \"But we work with them. ... Everywhere I go, I get the same reaction. They want toughness. They want firmness. They want to obey the law. But -- but they feel that throwing them out as a whole family when they've been here for a long time -- it's a tough thing.\"\nProposal No. 4: Possible pathway to legal status and possible mass deportations\nThe same day as his second Fox News town hall, Trump insisted he hadn\u2019t changed his position. He talked about granting legal status provided the undocumented immigrants leave the United States first, but also suggested there\u2019s a \"very good chance\" he\u2019ll deport them.\n\"You can\u2019t take 11 (million) at one time and just say, \u2018boom, you\u2019re gone.\u2019 We have to find where these people are. Most people don\u2019t even know where they are,\" he said to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Aug. 26. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a softening. I\u2019ve had people saying it\u2019s a hardening, actually. ... We\u2019re going to deport many people, many, many people.\"\nGiven that the vast majority of the undocumented immigrants are not criminals, Cooper asked, would they be able to gain legal status?\n\"Unless people leave\u00a0the country \u2014 well, when they come back in, if they come back in then they can start paying taxes,\" Trump responded. \"But there is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back.\"\nWhen pressed on whether he would deport undocumented immigrants who haven\u2019t committed a crime, Trump said, \"We\u2019re going to see what happens. But there's a very good chance the answer could be yes, but there's no legalization. There's no amnesty. If somebody wants to go the legalization route, what they'll do is they'll go leave the country, hopefully come back in and then we can talk.\"\nProposal No. 5: Deportations prioritizing criminals, visa overstays and \u2018public charges\u2019\nIn his Aug. 31 Phoenix, Ariz., speech outlining his immigration policy, Trump reiterated that legal status would only be granted to undocumented immigrants who \"return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else.\"\nAs for deportations, Trump suggested the threat would always loom, but the focus wouldn\u2019t be on law-abiding undocumented immigrants.\n\"Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation,\" he said. \"Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.\"\nProposal No. 6: \u2018Assess the situation\u2019\nA day after his speech, Trump suggested his mind wasn\u2019t quite made up, and that he\u2019d have to see which undocumented immigrants remained after all his policies had been implemented.\n\"We're going to sit back, we're going to assess the situation,\" Trump said on Fox News. \"We're going to make a decision at that time. I want to see, before we do anything further, I want to see how it shapes up when we have strong, you know, I use the word impenetrable borders.\"\nOur ruling\nPence said, \"Donald Trump\u2019s been completely consistent\" about his plan for nonviolent undocumented immigrants.\nTrump has been consistently vague about his policies for undocumented immigrants who live in the United States and largely obey the law.\nHe\u2019s advocated for mass deportations and then rejected mass deportations before saying there\u2019s a \"very good chance\" they would happen. He\u2019s said \"you have to give them a path\" but rejected \"amnesty\" and then said legal status could be granted to those who leave the country first and apply for reentry.\nWe rate Pence\u2019s claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/920df435-5269-4917-b4c1-4299ceef0a7c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04371"}
