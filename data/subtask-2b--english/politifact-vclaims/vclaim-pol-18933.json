The incendiary first verse includes obscenities and a line proclaiming that \"police think they have the authority to kill a minority.\"\nThe verse begins: \"F--- the police, coming straight from the underground.\"\nBut Biden did not play \"F--- Tha Police\" during the Sept. 15 event in Kissimmee, Fla., which was billed as a celebration of Hispanic heritage month and featured speeches from singer Ricky Martin and actress Eva Longoria in addition to Fonsi.
