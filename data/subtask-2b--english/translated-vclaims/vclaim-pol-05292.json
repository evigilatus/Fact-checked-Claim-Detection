African-American children are unemployed or underemployed by 51% We verified a similar statement from Sanders in July 2015 when Sanders mentioned it at a campaign event in Portland, Maine. We've mostly evaluated it right. And now, eight months later, we're going to reconsider it. We will start by noting that the most common unemployment rate statistics are not high for each category, as Sanders pointed out. The most easily available data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics cover the 16 to 19 age group, which is not identical but gives a quick rough estimate. For whites in that age group, the official unemployment rate in February 2016 was 13.9 per cent, for Americans of Spanish origin 15.6 per cent and for Americans of African descent 23.3 per cent. In other words, the official unemployment rate shows that unemployment among African-American youth is much higher than that of white youth and, to a lesser extent, that of young people of Spanish origin. However, the levels of each group are lower than what Sanders said. So what's going on? The Sanders camp referred to research published in June 2015 by the Institute for Economic Policy, a left-wing think tank. The figures in the report correspond to what Sanders said in the debate. These data differ from the most common measurements for several reasons. First, the Institute not only viewed the employment situation of persons between the ages of 17 and 20; rather, it limited the scope of its work to high school graduates who did not attend other studies. Second, the Expanded Programme on Immunization is no longer just unemployed workers, but also those who have been part-time workers due to the weakness of the economy and those who have been \"frequently associated with the labour force.\" The latter category includes persons who did not meet the strict definition of presence in the labour market, but were also not entirely outside the market. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" ==History==By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 the statistics used, known as the U-6 lanky shortcut, are officially called the measure of \"unemployed labour\" instead of \"employment.\" The Institute itself used the term \"deficit labour\" in its research. In the Miami debate, Sanders accurately described this census, referring to individuals who are \"unemployed or underemployed.\" Therefore, his statement is valuable. However, the data have become rather tacky, and since the employment picture has generally improved since mid-year, this is a potential problem for the accuracy of the Sanders statement. The last month analysed in the EPI study was March 2015. We do not know exactly how much improvement has been made to young and minority high school graduates since then, because this specific segment of data is not readily available on the website of the Office of Labour Statistics. However, we can make a rapid assessment based on the change in unemployment rates between March 2015 and February 2016 among people of Spanish and African-American descent between 16 and 19 years of age. During that period - since the EPI report - the unemployment rate for young people of Spanish descent has fallen from 20.9 per cent to 15.6 per cent, and for young people of African descent, from 25.1 per cent to 23.3 per cent. In other words, it is quite possible that the unemployment rates among young and minority high school graduates are now lower than Saunders said. We should caution that the unemployment rate for sub-populations, such as minority groups, tends to be volatile and has a greater margin of error than for the population as a whole. However, unemployment rates in these groups appear to be lower in recent months. During 2015, the unemployment rate for black youth was often 30 per cent or more, making the current rate of 23.3 per cent particularly low - the lowest rate since 2000, in fact. Similarly, in 2015, the unemployment rate for young people of Spanish descent was 20 per cent or more, a level far higher than the current rate of 15.6 per cent. Our sentence (Sanders) said, \"If you look at Latin children between 17 and 20 who have graduated from high school, 36% of them are unemployed or unemployed. African-American children are unemployed or underemployed by 51% As was the case when we first reviewed this allegation last July, the general point made by Sanders is true - that in comparing apples to lollipops, young African-Americans and Hispanics have much worse prospects in the labour market than whites. However, while Sanders had support for these data when he first started using these figures eight months ago, there is reason to believe that the improvement in the labour market has reduced these rates, at least to some extent. The statement is precise, but it needs further clarification or information, so we often evaluate it correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05292"}
