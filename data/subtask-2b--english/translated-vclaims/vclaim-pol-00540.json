This comment, which appears under the picture, says, \"Susan P. Anthony in 1872, was beaten and arrested for trying to vote.\" This picture was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The picture is a protest against the right to vote that was eventually called \"Black Friday\" - but it is not a picture of Susan B. Anthony and was not taken in 1872 or in the United States. The search for the opposite image led us to many locations that used the image as an example of the struggle of voters in the early 20th century. The picture appeared on the front cover of the British newspaper, \"The Daily Mirror,\" the day after nearly 300 women were taken to the streets of London in November 18, 1910, to air their complaints from the shelves of the Reconciliation Bill, which, according to the London Museum, would have expanded voting rights to nearly 1 million women, most of whom were wealthy real estate owners. The protest led to the arrest of 119 women who were subsequently released without charge. It is widely believed that the woman in the picture was Mrs. Ada Wright, who was 50 years old at the time. According to reports, she was beaten by a policeman while trying to enter the House of Commons. On January 11, 2021, Facebook was published in Nancy Belusi's newspaper, no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, Wright later wrote about the experiment and described herself as the woman in the picture. The passage can be found on page 261 of the 2004 book \"Evil London: 2000 Years of Riots, Rebels and Revolution\" by Clive Bloom:...\" The historian Kate Connelly also wrote about the event and identified Wright as the woman on the ground in the picture: \"When the Daily Miror published a picture of the voter Ada Wright lying on the ground, her hands holding her face, the government tried to stop selling the newspaper and ordered the destruction of the negative images.\" Our judgment on a viral image of social media is a picture of Susan B. Anthony, who \"battered and arrested for trying to vote\" in 1872. While the photograph was taken during a protest against the right to vote, the woman was not Susan B. Anthony, and did not take the picture in the United States or in 1872. This picture, believed to be that of Ada Wright, appeared on the front cover of a British newspaper following a protest against the vote in London in November 1910.
