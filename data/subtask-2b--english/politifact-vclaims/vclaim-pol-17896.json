Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2020 \nThe president referenced a TV segment from One America News Network, a cable network that has \"repeatedly published false or misleading information,\" according to NewGuard, a company that monitors news outlets.\u00a0\n\"I watched,\" Trump wrote. \"He fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?\"\nThe OANN segment cited a conservative blog post. It claimed Gugino was \"using his phone as a capture scanner\" to \"monitor the location of police\" before he was pushed to the ground.\nHere's the absolutely insane OAN report that Trump is referencing: \"The latest tensions in the Buffalo police department could be the result of a false flag provocation by far left group antifa\" pic.twitter.com/d709XfSj8U\u2014 Lis Power (@LisPower1) June 9, 2020 \u00a0\nSage Green, who knows Gugino through activism work in Buffalo, said she never knew him to be related to any antifa-type work, nor to be savvy with technology.\u00a0\n\"I\u2019ve never known him to be someone who has any radical tactics,\" Green said. \"He\u2019s not the troublemaker in the crowd.\"\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Gugino was trying to \"scan police communications\" before he was shoved \u2014 or that Gugino\u2019s fall, which left him bleeding from his ear and resulted in second-degree assault charges against two officers, was part of \"a set up.\"\n\"Not a piece of proof,\" said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a press conference.\nKelly V. Zarcone, Gugino\u2019s attorney, said in a statement that Gugino has \"always been a peaceful protester.\"\n\"No one from law enforcement has even suggested anything otherwise, so we are at a loss to understand why the president of the United States would make such dark, dangerous, and untrue accusations against him,\" she said.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\nRevisiting what happened\nA roughly 40-second video of the incident \u2014 which Buffalo police initially described as a \"skirmish involving protesters\" in which Gugino \"tripped and fell\" \u2014 was captured by WBFO\u2019s Mike Desmond on June 4. The video is graphic, but can be viewed here.\nThe video shows Gugino approaching a line of police officers with a phone in his right hand and what looks like a helmet in his left. Gugino stands face-to-face with a pair of officers and talks for a few seconds as a third officer shouts for Gugino to move.\u00a0\nOne officer shoves Gugino with a baton while another pushes him with his hand. The force sends Gugino stumbling backward and hitting the ground hard.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He\u2019s bleeding out of his ear,\" a person says repeatedly as Gugino lays motionless and blood pools on the pavement beneath him.\nZarcone, Gugino\u2019s attorney, said Gugino remains hospitalized.\nThe incident is under both internal affairs and criminal investigations, and the two officers facing charges have been suspended without pay. More than 50 members of the Buffalo police riot response team have since resigned from the unit\u00a0but are still working for the department.\u00a0\nThe Buffalo Police Department and a spokesperson for the Erie County district attorney\u2019s office both told us they could not comment on the case pending investigations.\nWhat we know about Gugino\nGugino has worked on causes around Buffalo through PUSH Buffalo, the Western New York Peace Center and other organizations. The Buffalo News reported that he is also involved in Catholic peace activism and nuclear disarmament.\u00a0\nThree activists who have worked with Gugino described him as willing to be involved in a range of social justice causes but said he was not an agitator.\u00a0\n\"From what I know of Martin, he has never spoken to me with being affiliated with antifa-type work,\" Green said.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, OANN\u2019s Pearson Sharp said the network is working on another report detailing Gugino\u2019s background as an activist.\n\"We have found substantial evidence that suggests Martin Gugino is, if not a professional provocateur, at least an enthusiastic one,\" Sharp told PolitiFact, citing past tweets, arrest records, and comments he said others made about Gugino.\nThe blog post cited by OANN includes a since-deleted tweet from Gugino saying, \"F--- the police.\" The Buffalo News reported that the Twitter account belonged to Gugino. Another tweet featured an anti-police hashtag.\nThe blog post also linked to Gugino\u2019s personal blog, where he says he\u2019s been arrested \u2014 but not convicted \u2014 for participating in prior protests.\nOANN\u2019s Sharp said Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown called Gugino an \"agitator\" and a \"key and major instigator,\" adding that Brown wouldn\u2019t \"single someone out like that without good reason.\" But in those comments, Brown was talking about a different protester.\u00a0\nWas Gugino trying to scan police communications?\nTrump\u2019s claims that the incident was a \"set up\" and that Gugino was waving his phone in an attempt to scan police communications are similarly unsubstantiated, with the only proof being that Gugino was holding a phone at the moment that he was pushed.\nThere are several mobile apps that let users listen to police scanners, and as the Washington Post noted, the Buffalo police radio frequencies are publicly available online. These apps don\u2019t give users the ability to \"black out the equipment,\" according to BBC News.\nGreen, Gugino\u2019s friend, said she didn\u2019t think Gugino had any capability to interfere with police communications.\u00a0\nThe OANN segment said \"newly released videos appear to show Gugino using a police tracker on his phone, trying to scan police communications.\" But the segment showed only an edited version of the original video that was slowed down.\nThe OANN segment \u2014 and the blog post it pulled from \u2014 also highlighted a photo of Gugino standing beside WBFO\u2019s Desmond, as well as a separate Twitter video that shows an unidentified protester saying, \"He\u2019s looking to get punched in the face.\"\nBut that doesn\u2019t substantiate Trump\u2019s claims about a \"set up\" and a \"scanner,\" either.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment ... Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?\"\nThis is an unsubstantiated conspiracy that made its way from a conservative blog site to Trump via One America News Network. There\u2019s no evidence that Gugino is connected to antifa, that he was \"aiming (a) scanner\" or that he was staging his fall as \"a set up.\"\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17896"}
