The worst unemployment in the region. Near the bottom in economic growth, yet Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires but vetoed a minimum wage hike.\"\n\nThe ad, which is also running on NJ.com, the online home of The Star-Ledger, is largely accurate.\n\nLet's review each claim.\n\nNew Jersey having the \u2018worst increase in unemployment\u2019 is based on the period from December 2011 to December 2012.\n\nLet\u2019s note that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics measures unemployment data by unemployment rates and the number of unemployed.\n\nFor that period, New Jersey and New Hampshire had the highest rate increase, at 0.3 percent. New Jersey\u2019s rate ticked upward to 9.5 percent from 9.2 percent.\n\nNew Jersey wasn\u2019t the worst, though, when looking at the number of unemployed, said Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. Pennsylvania had 24,761 unemployed. New Jersey had 21,932.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate increase was the 10th highest nationwide for the period from February 2012 to this past February, Seneca said.\n\nAnd with New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate hovering above 9 percent since June 2009 \u2013 the end of the recession \u2013 it\u2019s accurate to claim the state has nearly 1 in 10 people jobless. The state, however, has added more than 120,000 private-sector jobs, according to BLS data, Seneca and the state Republican Party.\n\nNext, did we have the \u2018worst unemployment in the region?\u2019\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne New Jersey didn\u2019t define region specifically so we compared New Jersey with New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Connecticut. New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate was the highest among the five states from December 2011 to December 2012, according to BLS data.\n\nThe ad also claims New Jersey is near the bottom for economic growth. We previously checked a similar claim by Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden).\n\nFrom 2010 to 2011, New Jersey\u2019s real gross domestic product \u2013 an inflation-adjusted measure of a state\u2019s economy -- dropped by a half percent, placing us 47th among all states, according to data from The Bureau of Economic Analysis. So we were near the bottom, but economic experts told us for the Greenwald claim that national and regional economic conditions \u2013 not just Christie -- were factors.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at whether Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires and vetoed a minimum wage increase.\n\nDemocrats approved a bill in May 2010 renewing a one-year tax rate increase of 10.75 percent for those with taxable income above $1 million. The rate had expired before Christie became governor.. Christie, who campaigned that he wouldn\u2019t raise taxes, vetoed the surcharge -- protecting the rich, some claim -- and Democrats couldn\u2019t override it.\n\nAs for the minimum wage claim, Christie in January vetoed a Democratic proposal raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 an hour, with future increases tied to inflation. He instead proposed phasing in a $1 increase over three years and eliminating automatic hikes.\n\n\"The sad truth is New Jersey is falling further behind, and no amount of hype can hide the reality that the middle-class and working families are hurting,\" One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne said in an e-mail. \"The facts clearly show New Jersey has consistently trailed the rest of America when it comes to jobs and the economy.\"\n\nNJGOP spokesman Ben Sparks pointed to the state's private-sector job growth under Christie.\n\n\"Despite the predictably misleading claims from Barbara Buono's campaign operatives, New Jersey has created over 120,000 private-sector jobs since Governor Christie took office, which stands in stark contrast to the failed two years Barbara Buono spent as Jon Corzine's budget chair, when our state lost 240,000 private-sector jobs,\" Sparks said in an e-mail.\n\nBuono, (D-Middlesex), is challenging Christie in the November gubernatorial election.\n\nOur ruling\n\nOne New Jersey\u2019s new ad claims, \"Under Republican Chris Christie, New Jersey had the highest increase in unemployment in the country last year. Nearly 1 in 10 jobless. The worst unemployment in the region. Near the bottom in economic growth, yet Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires but vetoed a minimum wage hike.\"\n\nEach claim had varying degrees of accuracy. New Jersey and New Hampshire tied for the highest increase in unemployment last year. Nearly 1 in 10 New Jerseyans are jobless, and our state\u2019s unemployment rate is the worst in a five-state region. The state has been near the bottom in economic growth, even though experts have said that\u2019s not entirely Christie\u2019s fault, and the governor vetoed a minimum wage hike. Christie technically didn\u2019t cut the millionaire\u2019s tax since it expired before he took office, but opinions vary wildly on that claim. We rate the ad Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09475"}
