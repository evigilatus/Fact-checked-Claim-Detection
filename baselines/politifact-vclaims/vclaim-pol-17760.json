The posts claim Schumer was pictured\u00a0on the private island of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. (Epstein\u00a0was arrested on sex trafficking charges before killing himself in custody.)\n\"Chuck Schumer kissing this child on Epstein island,\" reads the description of the image, which shows a white shirtless man in glasses kissing a young Black girl in a swimsuit. \"The VEIL has lifted!\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nA spokesperson for Schumer told us it is \"absolutely not\" the Democratic senator from New York.\nWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in this photo, or when and where it was taken.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s been online for months. Only now are people suggesting that it shows Schumer in a compromising situation.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found it posted five months ago on Picuki, a site that lets you browse Instagram photos. The post also features a French translation of a Jan. 17\u00a0article about Gambian children \"being sold to British pedeophiles.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe photo in question does not appear with the story.\u00a0\nOn Jan. 21, though, a tweet from an account that describes itself as a \"Civil Rights & Pan African organization to unite all people of African descent worldwide\" shared the image and said: \"One of the British pedophile abusing children in Gambia.\"\nOn the same day, a Facebook account called Focus On Gambia also posted the image, writing that \"the government of Gambia must take legal action against pedophiles in Gambia.\" (In the comments of this post, some users question whether the photo was actually taken in Gambia.)\nEpstein donated more than $184,000 to both Democratic and Republican politicians from 1990 until his death, including Schumer, who has since donated the money to anti-human trafficking charities.\u00a0\nBut we unearthed nothing to support that the image recirculating on social media shows Schumer or that the photo was taken on Epstein\u2019s island.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17760"}
