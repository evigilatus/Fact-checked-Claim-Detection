Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, was elected in a \"very low turnout\" race.", "truth_label": "half-true", "date": "stated on January 23, 2013 in comments on his MSNBC show:", "title": "Chris Matthews says Sen. Ron Johnson was elected in \u2018very low turnout\u2019 contest", "text": "For anyone still keeping score on pundit reaction to the clash between then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin over the attack on U.S. diplomats in Libya:\n\nDon\u2019t count Chris Matthews in the Johnson camp.\n\nTo say the least.\n\nThe host of the MSNBC-TV talk show \"Hardball\" lambasted the questions and remarks that Johnson, a Republican, addressed to Clinton when she appeared before a Senate committee on Jan. 23, 2013.\n\nMatthews and two guests that night heaped praise on Clinton, while ripping Johnson\u2019s queries about the way the attacks were initially portrayed to the public.\n\nMatthews went on to question, at least implicitly, the legitimacy of Johnson\u2019s 2010 win over Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold. That \u00a0mid-term election saw Republicans regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives and pick up seats in the Senate, including this one.\n\n\"That was kind of a pissant performance by that guy from Wisconsin,\" Matthews said of Johnson\u2019s questioning of Clinton. \"I don't know how these guys get over the wall into American politics. I think they won in a very low turnout elections (sic) in Wisconsin.\"\n\nMatthews was just getting warmed up.\n\nHe added: \"I think everybody should run now in national elections, forced to go into elections where there's a lot of voters, so you don't get this weird, warped sense of people coming who supposedly represent the American electorate. That guy doesn't represent anybody.\"\n\nWisconsin, in our memory, typically has high turnout elections.\n\nBut is Matthews right that Johnson was elected in a \"very low turnout\" one?\n\nDepends on the point of comparison.\n\nCompared with the 2008 and 2012 presidential years, the 2010 election in Wisconsin drew about 800,000-900,000 fewer voters, with the Senate race and a gubernatorial contest leading the ballot, state turnout data shows. That gap is a well-known feature of American politics.\n\nIn those two presidential years, about 72 percent of voting-eligible Wisconsinites turned out, and it was even higher -- almost 75 percent -- in 2004, according to calculations and analysis by the United States Election Project at George Mason University.\n\nBy contrast, Wisconsin turnout in the 2010 midterm election featuring Johnson-Feingold was about 52 percent of eligible voters.\n\nSo from that perspective, the turnout was lower.\n\nMSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski told us that Matthews meant just such a comparison in his remarks.\n\nShe explained further that Matthews\u2019 reference to multiple candidates -- \"they won in very low turnout elections in Wisconsin\" -- likely referred to Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who also won in that 2010 election.\n\nOn his show, Matthews also longed for a system where everybody runs in the higher-turnout presidential years. That\u2019s his opinion, of course, so we can\u2019t fact check it. But we can note that such a change would require a constitutional amendment, because Article One fixes those terms at six years for senators and two for House members.\n\nCase closed? Hardly.\n\nWe wondered: How did the 2010 midterm here stack up to midterms past -- and to similar contests in other states?\n\nAt 52 percent, turnout in 2010 was slightly lower than the 2006 turnout of 53 percent and significantly higher than the 45 percent in 2002, according to data from the George Mason project\u2019s website.\n\nIf you go back to 1998 -- when Feingold nipped Republican challenger Mark Neumann in a midterm -- the turnout was considerably lower than in the 2010 race that Matthews termed \"very low turnout.\"\n\nIn fact, in 1998, Feingold\u2019s vote total was 230,000 lower than his future challenger Johnson received in 2010.\n\nSo there\u2019s also fodder for saying that 2010 was a typical turnout year, or even high compared to a couple other relatively recent midterms.\n\nBut Matthews\u2019 statement put things in a national perspective -- \"I don't know how these guys get over the wall into American politics.\" So, how did turnout in Wisconsin stack up?\n\nIn 2010, the turnout in Wisconsin ran 11 percentage points above the U.S. average. Only six states had higher turnout on the day Johnson defeated Feingold: Minnesota, Maine, Washington, South Dakota, Oregon and Alaska.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to find examples of Democratic Party senators who won in November 2010 in states with lower turnout than Wisconsin. Among them: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Barbara Boxer of California and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n\nWe found that Wisconsin\u2019s turnout is typically around the top 5 no matter the year, based on six elections we reviewed.\n\nThere were even five states that had lower turnout in the 2012 presidential contest than Wisconsin did in the midterm year of 2010, according to the George Mason data. They were: Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Hawaii.\n\nMichael McDonald, the George Mason professor behind the elections project, said the Republican Party generally -- but not always -- gets an advantage in lower turnout midterm elections. Younger voters, the poor and minority voters come out in smaller numbers than in presidential election years, cutting into the modern Democratic Party\u2019s base, he noted.\n\nIt can cut the other way, too. Democrat Tammy Baldwin won Wisconsin\u2019s other Senate seat in 2012 amid the higher turnout in the presidential year.\n\nThe 2012 electorate included a higher percentage of liberals, city-dwellers and young voters, and a lower percentage of Republicans, than the 2010 electorate, our Journal Sentinel colleague Craig Gilbert reported in a \"Wisconsin Voter\" story in November 2012.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist and pollster Charles Franklin said it was \"crazy talk\" by Matthews if the MSNBC host was arguing that the only way a conservative such as Ron Johnson could win was in a midterm election.\n\nNational \"wave\" elections favoring one party or the other can factor in, and the particulars of each campaign factor in as well.\n\nFranklin noted that Jim Doyle, the Democrat who served two terms as Wisconsin governor, unseated a Republican incumbent in a 2002 midterm election. And Doyle won re-election in 2006.\n\nOur rating\n\nMatthews said Johnson won in a \"very low turnout\" election when he knocked off Feingold in 2010.\n\nHis comment holds up if the comparison point is presidential years, but it\u2019s off the mark if prior midterms in Wisconsin and in other states are the standard.\n\nWe rate his statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09737"}
