The actor and director didn\u2019t say he was leaving Hollywood to \"fight against traitors with real American patriots with President Trump.\" And there\u2019s no evidence that he authored an attack against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden that\u2019s now spreading on social media.\n\"Just in case I\u2019m gone tomorrow, please know this: I voted against, Biden, that incompetent, lying, flip-flopping, insincere, double-talking, radical socialist, terrorist excusing, bleeding heart, narcissistic, scientific and economic moron that spent eight years-in the White House trying to destroy our wonderful country and turn it into Muslim loving, socialist crap hole like he came from and I don\u2019t mean Hawaii!\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe fact-checked a nearly identical statement attributed to Eastwood in 2019. Only then, he supposedly said that that he had voted against former President Barack Obama, whom he described as an \"incompetent, lying, insincere, narcissisitc, double-talking, socialist hyporticte, and fiscally irresponsible moron.\"\nEastwood didn\u2019t say that, and we found nothing to support that he said this about Biden. In fact, a representative for Eastwood told the Daily Caller\u2019s Check Your Fact that the quote attributed to Eastwood is \"utterly false.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Eastwood told Esquire that he would vote for Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\"I\u2019d have to go for Trump,\" he said at the time. \"You know, \u2018cause she\u2019s declared that she\u2019s gonna follow in Obama\u2019s footsteps.\"\nBut more recently, Eastwood has distanced himself from the president. In February, he told the Wall Street Journal that while he approves of \"certain things that Trump\u2019s done\" he wishes Trump would act \"in a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names.\" Eastwood also expressed support for former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who had not yet dropped out of the Democratic presidential race.\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18808"}
