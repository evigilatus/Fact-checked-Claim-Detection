Those funds are for state operations, funded by state resources. They exclude federal funds, which the state does not control, and capital spending. Spending included in State Operating Funds go beyond the state\u2019s General Fund, however, and also includes things such as state-funded special revenue funds and some debt service. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe independent Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research organization,\u00a0analyzes state budgets and\u00a0found that the 2018-19 budget, which began April 1, calls for increased spending of 4.5 percent. The commission found that, despite state leaders\u2019 proclamations that spending growth had stayed at 2 percent, \"after adjusting for shifts of certain types of spending out of state operating funds or across fiscal years, the budget actually increases 4.5 percent from fiscal year 2018.\"\nA commission analysis of the 2017-18 budget found that spending would rise by 3.7 percent, despite the administration\u2019s claim that it would rise by only 2 percent. The administration moved spending around to other funds or other years in order to maintain 2 percent growth, according to the commission.\nThe author of both of those reports, David Friedfel, spoke about the governor\u2019s record on spending increases during a post-debate podcast from the commission and Gotham Gazette. For the first six years of his administration, Cuomo is right to say that he kept spending growth at 2 percent, said Friedfel, director of state studies at the commission. But in the last year and in the current year, that\u2019s not the case, he said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The 2 percent certainly isn\u2019t accurate, and to continue to push that is problematic, just from a transparency perspective,\" he said. \u00a0\nState Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli had similar findings.\nDiNapoli, who is independently elected and whose staff analyzes every budget, reports that increases in spending in the 2018-19 budget is more than double Cuomo\u2019s state spending cap. DiNapoli\u2019s budget analysis, released in July, stated that though the Cuomo administration had claimed that it stuck to a spending increase of 2 percent, when budget management actions are accounted for, such as taking $1.4 billion in spending for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority off-budget, \"the Office of the State Comptroller estimates State Operating Funds spending growth at more than 5 percent.\"\nFor the 2017-18 budget, DiNapoli found that after adjusting for budget actions that allowed the administration to claim only a 2 percent increase, that spending was actually set to increase by \"approximately 4 percent.\"\nOur ruling\nMolinaro said that state spending under Cuomo has increased beyond the 2 percent cap, despite Cuomo\u2019s claims.\nCuomo has been in office since 2011. In the first six years, as PolitiFact New York and others have pointed out, Cuomo kept the growth in state spending to 2 percent. \u00a0\u00a0\nBut in the last two years, state spending has increased beyond 2 percent, though the Cuomo administration has shifted spending in the budget to make it appear as if the 2 percent cap has been honored, according to experts.\nWe rate Molinaro\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01386"}
