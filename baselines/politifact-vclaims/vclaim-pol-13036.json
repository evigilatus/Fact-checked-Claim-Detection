The text of the ad asks, \"Why is Tim Pawlenty running for president? Is it his track record as governor?\" while really annoying oompa music plays in the background.\n\nThe ad then shows what looks like local news coverage from 2009. \"Gov. Pawlenty eliminated the program that provides health care to 33,000 low-income residents,\" says a narrator. \"(The) governor has systematically been cutting programs to the core since he took office.\" Another person says, \"All of a sudden we\u2019re going to have 35,000 people without health insurance.\"\n\nThe ad makes some other claims, too. It said that Pawlenty has flip-flopped on his position on cap and trade (accurate; we gave him a Full Flop for that) and that he\u2019s said he doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s running for president (inaccurate, according to FactCheck.org).\n\nHere, we wanted to focus on the claim that Pawlenty eliminated a health insurance program for approximately 33,000 low-income people in 2009.\n\nWe asked the Democratic National Committee and the Tim Pawlenty campaign for responses on this, and didn\u2019t hear back from either one.\n\nBut journalists in Minnesota thoroughly covered the big political fight over a health care program that covered about 33,000 people back in 2009. We found that Pawlenty ultimately reduced the size of the health program and limited benefits, but care wasn\u2019t entirely eliminated.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

(At that time, Medicaid was only open to people who were both low income and elderly, disabled, young or pregnant.)\n\nMinnesota needed to trim its budget in 2009, and Pawlenty proposed changing the program to save money. The changes would limit benefits and discourage emergency room visits by transferring some, but not all, of the beneficiaries to a program called MinnesotaCare, which required premiums. Advocates for the poor and hospital officials said the cuts would be devastating.\n\nPawlenty used his line-item veto to eliminate funding for the old program in May 2009, but he continued to negotiate with the Democratic-controlled legislature for the rest of the year and into 2010. \"We are open to considering health care reforms during the 2010 session, but they need to be financially responsible,\" Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung said on Jan. 13, 2010.\n\nBy February, though, Pawlenty vetoed General Assistance Medical Care again, which led to a public outcry and another round of negotiations with the Democratic-controlled legislature. In April, a compromise was reached to continue the program through May and then begin scaling it back, forcing beneficiaries to get care through hospitals or the hospitals\u2019 approved clinics. The compromise reduced funding from an estimated \u00a0$400 million to $132 million for the year, according to the Minneapolis-based Star Tribune.\n\nThe compromise itself wasn\u2019t without problems. Pawlenty\u2019s administration had to negotiate with hospitals on limits for how many beneficiaries each hospital had to accept.\n\nAs a footnote, the program changed yet again once Pawlenty left office. Pawlenty was succeeded by a Democrat, Mark Dayton, who campaigned on using the federal health care law of 2010 to expand the Medicaid program in Minnesota. Signing an executive order to do so was one of Dayton\u2019s first acts as governor, which moved the General Assistance Medical Care program into Medicaid.\n\nThe ad from the Democrats says that Pawlenty eliminated a health care program for 33,000 to 35,000 people. He did veto the program, but then he negotiated a change to lower costs by reducing benefits. So we rate the ad\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13036"}
