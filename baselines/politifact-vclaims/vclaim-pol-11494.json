We evaluated several statements from her press release. Here, we're looking at whether the district has\u00a0graduation rates \"substantially higher than the state average\" and dropout rates \"below the state average.\"\n\nThe press release puts it this way: The district \"increased graduation rate of 88.5 percent (Florida calculation) and 85.5 percent (National Governors Association calculation), which are substantially higher than the state average.\" It also \"secured [a] dropout rate of 1.0 percent, which has plummeted below the state average.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState reports show that Fiorentino rightly states the district\u2019s graduation rates, and that they are higher than state averages, which were 81.2 percent and 80.1 percent, according to the two different calculations. Pasco\u2019s rates are also up significantly from 2006-07 on both the state (73.7 percent) and governors association (67.8 percent) measures.\n\nPasco also was among a small handful of districts that did not have significant gaps in the rates among its various demographic groups.\n\nFiorentino accurately touts the district\u2019s improved dropout rate. State reports show the district dropout rate was 1.0 percent for 2010-11, down from 3.5 percent in 2006-07. The overall state rates were 3.3 percent in 2006-07 and 1.9 percent in 2010-11, so Pasco did show better improvement than the state.\n\nFiorentino is on solid ground in these two numeric claims about the district\u2019s academic performance.
