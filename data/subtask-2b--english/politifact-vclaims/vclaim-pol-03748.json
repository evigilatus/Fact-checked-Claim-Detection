The latest version we saw was on Jan. 18, 2017, two days before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, but there were many other examples.\nThe story was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook\u2019s effort to limit the impact of fake news on readers\u2019 news feeds.\nIn the posts, Obama is quoted as praising his own record and saying he commissioned the $200,000 bronze statue (repeatedly spelled \"statute,\" as in a law or rule) to preserve his legacy. He wanted the statue \"permanently erected in the entryway of the White House,\" the article asserted.\nSome versions included the image above, purportedly of the statue standing watch in the Oval Office.\nClearly, the article is contrived. We could find no credible mention of an Obama statue being put in or near the front door of the White House.\nThe source of this false account is a Dec. 31, 2016, post on EmpireNews.net. The website says it is \"intended for entertainment purposes only,\" and that its content can\u2019t be reproduced without consent.\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from the website when we asked whether permission had been granted to any other outlets.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a real Obama statue, and it is actually bronze. But it\u2019s not anywhere in the White House.\nIt\u2019s along the \"avenue of heroes\" near Puerto Rico\u2019s Capitol building in San Juan, where the statue was installed in 2012. Every president who has visited Puerto Rico gets a statue there; Obama took a trip to the commonwealth in 2011.\nThe image currently on the original EmpireNews.net post is a photo from the Flickr account of a photographer named Paul Sableman, and is dated Jan. 8, 2013.\nIt looks like hoaxsters combined the statue image with a photo of the Oval Office.\nBut even the background is not the Oval Office. It\u2019s really a photo from the U.K.\u2019s Mirror of a replica created by a Longview, Texas, man named Ron Wade.\nWade reportedly spent $250,000 to build a facsimile of the Oval Office at 80 percent scale. The composite doesn\u2019t even feature Obama\u2019s decor \u2014 the absence of his chunky mica coffee table was the giveaway.\nWhile EmpireNews.net labels itself a joke website in a disclaimer, there\u2019s no evidence of that in the faux story. That\u2019s doubly true when other sites then share the story. The addition of the composite image made from misappropriated photographs only heightens the deceit.\nWe\u2019ve chiseled out the details to cast our own decision. We rate this headline Pants On Fire!\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91a0ecb0-36fd-4b9d-bcdc-02dabfffc498", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03748"}
