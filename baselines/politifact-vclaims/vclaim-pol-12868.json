ORLibertyGal tweeted: \"Multnomah County plans to interfere with your food delivery. Oh goodie http://bit.ly/jFhTe5\"\n\nMinutes later, BlueOregon contributor T.A. Barnhart responded: \"onus on fearmongers to provide FACTS. | RT @ORlibertygal: MultCo plans to interfere w/food delivery. http://bit.ly/jFhTe5 #orpol #orleg\"\n\nFacts? We love facts. Multnomah County wants to mess with food delivery? We better look into this. (Thanks Barnhart!)\n\nIt turns out that the tweet stemmed from an online post at Red County, a website for conservative politicos. Gresham resident and Tea Party activist Roxanne Ross accused Multnomah County of using its 2009 food action plan \"to artificially inflate the market\" for organic local produce while dampening the availability of cheaper mass produced foods.\n\nThe county,writes Ross, \"clearly plans to disrupt the free market system in terms of food choices making it harder and more expensive for many residents to eat their food of choice.\" Some specifics cited by Ross (in our own words): \u00a0\n\n\nMultnomah County wants to turn available space into farm plots, in order to feed more people within county lines.\n\nMultnomah County plans to disrupt restaurant food delivery service, by having retailers buy from local farmers.\n\nMultnomah County wants \"communal kitchens\" to encourage more use of local foods.\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, we had to study the plan for ourselves. We wondered if the county had visions of turning itself into a self-sustaining village with high taxes on out-of-county products. We turned to the Multnomah Food Action Plan 2025 and found that it\u2019s not quite what Ross claims. The plan is aspirational and fuzzy, with backers saying it should lead to more collaboration and focus. From the document itself:\n\n\"The 15-year action plan offers four action areas containing 16 goals and 65 communitywide collaborative actions for local government, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith communities, and learning institutions. This Plan also offers 40 actions for individual community members whose daily choices or lack of choices in what to eat, where to shop, and how to become an advocate for change greatly influence our community.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of partnerships and a lot of emphasis on individual choice. And frankly, it all sounds very pie-in-the-sky to PolitiFact Oregon. But we digress. Simply put, we bet that by 2025, shoppers will still be able to buy low-priced meats and potato chips from Fred Meyer.\n\nDavid Austin, spokesman for the county, agrees. He described the food plan as a promotional tool, a way to encourage residents and businesses to think of healthy food choices. (For example, sustainability staff just held its second \"food summit\" in June.) In 15 years, he said, as a result of the plan there might be healthier food choices in food-deprived neighborhoods currently served by convenience stores. Or, he said, there might be more community gardens with neighbors donating produce to the Oregon Food Bank.\n\n\"Multnomah County is not going to put a sign on every corner and demand that no chips are sold here. At the same time, we want to make sure all of our residents have equal access to healthy food,\" he said.\n\nIn an email, Ross said she\u2019s not saying the county will halt importation of food. But she insists that the \"market manipulations\" cited in the plan, such as zoning for urban farms, will protect local foods, meaning that \"for those people who prefer meat and food from outside the county, it will mean increased cost for food.\"\n\nSince we\u2019re not economists, we decided to ask Portland State University environmental economics professor David Ervin how a fuzzy food plan could result in higher prices for meat and other foods from outside the county. He was puzzled.\n\n\"Unless there\u2019s regulations restricting the entry of food, of those foods she\u2019s talking about, or there\u2019s some additional costs imposed on those foods, then there\u2019s not good economic logic on why their costs would go up,\" he said. \"Those prices are set in national markets.\" \u00a0\n\nErvin explains that if more people choose to eat local food, that \"will reduce the demand for those other imported foods, but I doubt that would have much of a price effect because we\u2019re such a small part of the market.\"\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, we called the Cascade Policy Institute, a libertarian think tank that loves all things free market and hates government meddling. We got an earful from John Charles, the institute\u2019s president and CEO, on both the meaninglessness of the plan, as well as its inconsistencies, and its poor writing. But the bottom line, he said, is that government already has the tools to encourage food choice: get rid of restrictive codes and high business taxes.\n\n\"Assuming that eating locally grown food is desirable -- I don\u2019t care whether people eat imported food, it is not a function of government to even care... ,\" he said. \"... Assuming there\u2019s some reason why local is good, we can accomplish that by relaxing some regulations, and giving producers and consumers the maximum choices.\"\n\nWe asked Charles specifically whether the county\u2019s plan would result in higher prices of meat and non-local foods. He said no.\n\nIn the end, we don\u2019t see how encouraging urban gardening and healthy eating and supporting a communal kitchen and small farmers will lead to higher prices for meat and bulk foods. There\u2019s no disruption to the free flow of goods in and out of the market. In fact, those points -- price and disruption -- are ridiculous.\n\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoug Whitsett\n\n\nstated on June 3, 2011 in a legislative hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Medford Water Commission was fined $279,000 for dumping plain drinking water into a stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 June 18, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12868"}
