Amid that growth, the mayor also highlighted a trend moving in the opposite direction: the city\u2019s \u00a0jobless rate is shrinking, he claimed.\n\n\"We've seen in this last year tremendous things happening, including our unemployment rate come down 2 percentage points,\" Booker said on WBGO\u2019s \"Newark Today\" on Feb. 23.\n\nA spokeswoman for the mayor provided data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from January 2011 to December 2011 to support Booker\u2019s claim. During that time frame the unemployment rate in Newark fell from 15.9 percent \u00a0to 13.9 percent.\n\nBut that comparison has flaws. The data on unemployment rates in New Jersey\u2019s cities are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations such as holiday and summer hiring.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrett Schmitt, an economist with U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, said for that reason, the agency recommends comparing annual averages or year-over-year data, meaning one month from one year to the same month the next year, when using nonseasonally adjusted data..\n\nThe average annual rate for 2011 is not yet available. From December 2010 to December 2011, the most recent month of federal data available, Newark\u2019s unemployment rate fell from 14.6 percent to 13.9 percent, or 0.7 percentage points.\n\n\"The Mayor\u2019s statement was 100% true and factually accurate. The unemployment rate in Newark in 2011 fell by 2 percentage points,\" Adam Zipkin, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for economic and housing development, said in a statement. \"This is significant because it is the first time in seven years that Newark has seen the unemployment rate fall within a calendar year by two full percentage points. While experts, economists and others may want to color, shape or contextualize that fact with other statistics over different time periods, it is still a fact. Just as when monthly job and unemployment numbers are reported broadly on national networks, many people will have comments on those facts but the numbers themselves are indisputable.\"\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that using the time frame Booker\u2019s office cited, a similar claim about the jobless rate could have been made in 2010. That year, the unemployment rate fell from 16.1 percent in January to 14.6 percent in December.\n\nBut the next month, in January 2011, the rate jumped to 15.9 percent. That\u2019s not an isolated incident. Since 2006, the unemployment rate has increased in January from the previous December.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBooker claimed that in the past year, Newark\u2019s unemployment rate fell two percentage points.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Newark mayor cited nonseasonally adjusted federal data from January 2011 to December 2011 to support his claim. Within that time frame, the unemployment rate fell two percentage points. But an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said his agency recommends comparing year-over-year data or annual averages when using statistics that are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.\n\nFrom December 2010 to December of last year, the city\u2019s unemployment rate dropped 0.7 percentage points, not two percentage points.\n\nWe rate this claim False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11518"}
