They fear that an economic revival in Iran would allow it to build its military and boost its funding of proxy fighters who oppose Israel and key Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia.\nIsrael\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, raised that issue July 13, 2015, at a major gathering in Washington of Christians United for Israel, an evangelical group.\n\"That deal will not bring peace closer. It will bring war closer \u2014 making conventional war more likely today and the horrors of nuclear terrorism more likely tomorrow,\" Dermer said. He posted the speech on his Facebook page.\nA short bit later, Dermer talked about the impact of unfreezing Iranian assets.\n\"The promise of phased sanctions relief looks more like a one-time jackpot for the Ayatollah regime,\" he said. \"In a few months, this deal would give Iran $150 billion. Iran has a $300 (billion) to $400 billion economy. A $150 billion infusion of cash into Iran\u2019s coffers is like $8 trillion flowing into the United States treasury.\"\nDermer did not say where he got his numbers or elaborate on his analogy.\u00a0We asked the Embassy of Israel\u00a0in Washington to clarify Dermer\u2019s statement but did not\u00a0hear back.\nAbsent hearing from the source, we assume that the underlying math runs as follows: $150 billion is half of $300 billion (the low end of Dermer\u2019s estimate of Iran\u2019s GDP). The U.S. economy is over $16 trillion ($18.1 billion in 2015), so half of that gives you the $8 trillion Dermer cited.\nThe reality of the deal's effect\u00a0is much more complicated than Dermer's math lets on.\u00a0And though there are issues with his numbers,\u00a0the\u00a0fundamental flaw\u00a0is his\u00a0logic.\nHe treats\u00a0GDP, which is the sum of all goods and services generated by a nation\u2019s economy, as if it were the same as the government\u2019s bank account. This is sort of\u00a0like saying your yearly income is the same as your checking account.\nMost Americans would like that to be true, but it isn\u2019t.\u00a0The two are completely different, and so are GDP and national treasuries.\nSo even though it would be fair to note that Iran\u2019s state-owned oil company accounts for a huge chunk of the country\u2019s economy, Iran's access to that money is not like the U.S. treasury getting an infusion of $8 trillion. A\u00a0government and its economy are not one and the same.\nDermer would have been on slightly\u00a0firmer ground if he had said unfreezing Iran's assets\u00a0would be like injecting $8 trillion into Iran's economy. But he didn't, and the analytic issues don't stop there.\nThere\u2019s also a problem with the numbers Dermer used. There are different ways to estimate Iran\u2019s GDP, but according to the World Bank, Iran\u2019s economy is $415 billion. If we re-do Dermer\u2019s math, that would mean the equivalent impact in the United States \u2014 regardless of Dermer\u2019s troubled metaphor \u2014 would be about 30 percent lower than he said.\nIt\u2019s also likely that Dermer inflated the size of Iran\u2019s assets that were frozen under sanctions.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department estimates the value of Iran\u2019s foreign currency reserves at $100 billion. An article in Foreign Policy magazine cited $120 billion. We don\u2019t know where Dermer got $150 billion.\nThe Institute of International Finance, a trade association representing banks, insurance companies and other financial entities worldwide, ran its own numbers and settled on $100 billion.\nGarbis Iradian is the association\u2019s chief economist for Africa and the Middle East. Iradian told us that the money in those overseas accounts does belong to the government of Iran and\u00a0about two-thirds of it comes from oil sales. Sanctions imposed in 2012 forbid the repatriation of those dollars to Iran.\nIf the deal goes into effect, there will be a delay of at least a few months before Iran\u2019s accounts are unfrozen. First, the International Atomic Energy Agency must certify that Iran is doing what it promised. That certification is being called \"Implementation Day,\" and when that happens, Iran will gain access to its foreign reserves.\nDoes that mean that all of the money will go back to Iran in a great rush? No one knows for sure.\nMichael Malloy is a law professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento and the author of The Structure of Economic Sanctions to be published next spring by Cambridge University Press. Malloy said the funds smooth the process when Iran needs to buy things on the international market. The hard currency is in place to transfer to the foreign seller.\n\"The Iranians will need those facilities,\" Malloy said. \"Those account relationships will continue and a lot of that money will stay.\"\nIradian said that in theory, Iran could decide to bring all the money home, but he too suspects that is unlikely. While Tehran might tap $10 billion or even $20 billion, Iradian said the money is a hedge against shifts in the international market, especially the price of oil. (A quick term of art: A country\u2019s current account is the balance between money going out for imports, and the money coming in from exports.)\n\"If oil prices drop below $50 a barrel, then the current account of the country will be negative,\" Iradian said. \"How will they finance the gap? They will tap their official reserves.\"\nIradian described the Iranian central bank managers as prudent.\n\"The official reserve is a fall back position,\" he said. \"It\u2019s like you keeping money in your checking account in case you lose your job. For Iran, it has security for whenever it has difficulty meeting its foreign exchange needs.\"\nIradian has written that the lifting of sanctions, of which unfreezing Iranian bank accounts is a part, will provide a major boost to the Iranian economy.\nAgain, the\u00a0effects on the economy\u00a0are different from the money in Iran's treasury.\nOur ruling\nDermer said that for an economy the size of Iran, unfreezing $150 billion of Iranian assets would be like pumping $8 trillion into the U.S. treasury. There are several problems with this claim. It exaggerates the value of Iran\u2019s frozen assets, underestimates the size of the Iranian economy, and confuses the concepts of a country\u2019s economy and the money in its treasury.\nWhile Iran would gain access to foreign currency reserves worth about $100 billion, it is far from certain that the money would go directly into government spending. On the other hand, an amount of money on that scale would have a significant impact on the nation\u2019s finances.\nThe numbers are off and the logic is flawed, but this statement has an element of accuracy.
