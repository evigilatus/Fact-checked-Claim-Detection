And the study includes one federal provision -- the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes paid -- to make state tax systems \"look more regressive.\"\nHowever, data for the omitted taxes were not available, the institute told us. And even if the federal deduction were not considered, the richest 1 percent in Wisconsin would still have a lower state and local tax burden than other income groups in Wisconsin.\nRichard Auxier, state and local tax policy expert at the nonprofit Tax Policy Center, noted state and local taxes in the vast majority of states, including Wisconsin, are regressive: They rely largely on sales and property taxes, which generally take a bigger bite out of the incomes of lower income people than higher income people.\nHe also said that although Wisconsin\u2019s income tax is relatively progressive, its earned income tax credit, which eases the income tax burden on lower-income residents, isn\u2019t overly generous.\nSo, given the generally regressive nature of taxes states rely upon, McCabe\u2019s statement is not surprising. Indeed, if he made the statement about 48 of the 50 states (except Alaska and California, plus the District of Columbia), it would be on target, according to the report he cited.\nOur rating\nMcCabe says: \"When you look at all the state and local taxes we pay in Wisconsin, the wealthiest 1 percent pay the lowest overall tax rate.\"\nHis claim is based on a 2015 report which found that the top 1 percent of earners (income of $399,000 and above) pay 6.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes -- a lighter burden than six lower income groups. It\u2019s important to note that the report\u2019s methodology has its critics, but it is the latest available study that attempts to assess state and local tax burdens.\nWith that caveat, we rate the statement Mostly True.\n\u00a0\nMore fact checks on the richest\nMark Pocan: Under \"Trumpcare,\" the Republican replacement for Obamacare, \"$600 billion worth of tax breaks will go to the wealthiest in this country.\" Half True.\nJennifer Shilling: Under Donald Trump's tax plan, \"the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- \u00a0would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined.\" True.\nBernie Sanders: \"The top one-tenth of 1 percent\" of Americans \"own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.\" Mostly True.\nJeb Bush: \"The top 1 percent pay 45 percent of all taxes in the country.\" Half True.\n Share the Facts 2017-06-06 18:32:56 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"When you look at all the state and local taxes we pay in Wisconsin, the wealthiest 1 percent pay the lowest overall tax rate.\"    Mike McCabe Founder, Blue Jeans Nation   In an interview Sunday, May 21, 2017 2017-05-21    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03249"}
