We wanted details.\nBarton subsequently told us in an e-mail: \"I knew several of the key Democrats who put it together (including the head of the union based in Houston who was a principal in the event) and I also heard about it from influential business leaders who were invited to the event by Garcia and Lanier.\" He said guests were summoned by phone or e-mail.\nStraus\u2019s spokeswoman, Tracy Young, confirmed that Straus raised money for his campaign at a May 4, 2010 party held at the Laniers\u2019 Houston home. Young said, though, the event was hosted by Harris County\u2019s entire House delegation\u2014not just Democrats. Also, she said, Garcia, the county commissioner, did not attend.\nWe reached Garcia, who said she was invited to the party, but couldn\u2019t attend -- nor did she call or e-mail anyone to invite them. Barton\u2019s suggestion that she did so, Garcia said, \"is just not true.\" Asked if she\u2019s a Straus supporter, Garcia replied: \"Not really ... The only campaign I am worried about is the Sylvia Garcia re-election campaign.\" By e-mail, Young forwarded a document inviting recipients to the \"Bayou Tribute to Speaker Joe Straus.\" Under \"Honorary Host Committee\" it lists 29 Houston-area House members, 17 Republicans and 12 Democrats.\nYoung also shared a document titled \"Host Committee\" listing more than 30 sponsors of the event including Bob Perry and tort-reform advocate Dick Weekley, Houston homebuilders and major GOP donors; super-lobbyist Mike Toomey of Austin; beer distributor and donor John Nau of Houston and political action committees for law firms, pilots and oil and energy-related firms. The listed sponsors include a PAC for the United Transportation Union.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Laniers are among eight identified underwriters of the party. While mayor of Houston, Bob Lanier was viewed as a Democrat, though the office is filled via non-partisan elections. The May event at the Lanier\u2019s home, Young said, \"wasn't a Democrat(ic) fundraiser - it was a bipartisan fundraiser.\"\nHow does all this add up?\nWithout a subpoena, we can\u2019t determine whether Garcia invited others to the fundraiser, though it appears she did not attend. \nThe rest of Barton\u2019s statement is notable for what it leaves out. For instance, it\u2019s fair to say the Laniers sponsored the party. But so did more than two dozen other backers, including GOP benefactors. While \"numerous\" Democratic officials were listed as honorary hosts, so were many Republican officeholders.\nAs for \"high-ranking union officials,\" we identified one union\u2019s role. On the other side of the political spectrum Barton did not mention hosts such as Anadarko Petroleum PAC. That committee\u2019s parent company is a partner BP oil well that blew in the Gulf of Mexico. It\u2019s also the biggest single corporate donor to Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nWe weren\u2019t given a list of guests so we could not assess their partisan affiliations. At the least, the Straus event does not appear to have been planned as the Democratic fundraiser Barton portrays. To the contrary, it may have underscored a reality of Texas politics: It behooves players of all stripes to make merry with the speaker.\nWe rate Barton\u2019s sally Barely True.\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14814"}
