At some point, Clinton said, \"Donald Trump says that climate change is a trick invented by the Chinese.\" Did he do that? Yeah, although he later said it was a joke. The original source of this allegation was Trump's tweet sent in November 6, 2012, as we noted in January 2016 to verify the facts of a similar allegation by Clinton's democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders. The Trump tweet says: \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing uncompetitive.\" So Clinton definitely has evidence to support her claim. But we must also note that Trump retracted his claim after Sanders noticed it in January on NBC in a meeting with the press, calling the Chinese link \"a joke.\" On January 18, after Sanders attacked Trump's views on climate change in the democratic debate, Trump Fox and friends said, \"Well, I think that climate change is just a very expensive form of taxation. A lot of people make a lot of money. I know a lot about climate change. I'm gonna get an environmental award. I'm often kidding that this is in China's favor. Obviously, I'm kidding. But this is in China's favor, because China does nothing to help climate change. They burn everything you can burn, and they don't care much. They don't have them either. You know that their work doesn't give things. But in the meantime, they can reduce our price. So it's very difficult for our business.\" Trump may make a joke about China's role, but he certainly has a long record of using the word \"awe\" to describe climate change. (For information, in 2014 we assessed the claim that climate change is \"brushing\" pants on fire.) On December 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., \"Obama talks about all this with global warming and... a lot of it is a trick. It's a trick. I mean, it's a lucrative industry, okay? It's a trick, a lot of it.\" This means three times using the word \"hoax\" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since his tweet in 2012. On January 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, \"NBC News just called it the Great Freeze - The Coldest Weather of Years. Does our country still spend money on the Hawks of World War?\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 in January 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: \"Sno in Texas and Louisiana, a record of frozen temperatures throughout the country and abroad. Global warming is an expensive trick!\" On the same day, he said: \"Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old crap about climate change (global warming)! I'm tired of hearing this shit. Trump also called climate change \"Freak\" on January 6, 2014, Fox and Friends. In addition, on 24 September 2015, CNN's new day edition said, \"I do not believe in climate change.\" On January 18, 2016, Trump said that climate change \"is in China's favor, because China does nothing to help climate change. We did not find Trump using the word \"hoax\" in the months since we verified previous facts, but he did not retract his aggressive doubts about climate change and policies designed to mitigate it. In fact, he dedicated his opposition to climate change efforts as a key part of his programme. In a landmark speech on energy policy in North Dakota on 26 May 2016, Trump attacked \"the harsh climate rules.\" He called for the abolition of \"all operational work that destroys Obama's functions, including the Climate Action Plan\" and said that \"the completion of the Paris Climate Agreement and the cessation of all United States dollar tax payments for the United Nations Global Warming Programmes.\" \"President Obama entered the United States into the Paris Climate Agreements unilaterally and without permission from Congress,\" said Trump. \"This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over the amount of energy we use here in America.\" Clinton the Governor said, \"Donald Trump says that climate change is a trick invented by the Chinese.\" Trump tweeted that opinion in 2012, although he made efforts earlier this year to describe that observation as a \"joking.\" However, Trump has repeatedly described climate change as an \"aggressive\" in speeches, tweets and media demonstrations, and although he has not necessarily repeated the accusation that China \"invented\" climate change, in January 18, 2016, he recently said that work on climate change is \"in favour of China.\" We're mostly assessing the claim right.
