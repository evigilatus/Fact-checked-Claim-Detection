The battle against the Ebola virus is designed specifically for such speculations and the radio broadcaster Governor Glen Beck fully lifted it on October 15 of his radio programme. Beck's perception of scared Americans avoid flights to the mall, leading to a decline in consumer spending. Although the virus has so far been known only by contact with the physical fluids of one infected person, Beck said that it would change. \"Think of this America, please think of this,\" said Beck. \"Every time a new person gets Ebola, it changes. He'll go for nothing.\" Going to aerosol means drops of water from sneeze or cough can transmit the disease. There is no recorded case of this with Ebola; one study positively confirms that HIV is not spreading in this way. However, Beck said that 8,000 Ebola victims in West Africa represented 8,000 \"different mix\" of Ebola. We say there's no way to verify the prediction, but what we can do is dig deeper into Beck's claim that Ebola is changing with every new person. We called Beck's producer and added some details that Beck ignored. \"Many of those mutations mean nothing, but some may be able to change the way the virus behaves within the human body,\" said the producers in the e-mail. According to two leading researchers in infectious diseases, Beck is true that the virus is mutating, but ignore what its producers later noticed - that is, not every mutation does anything to make Ebola more deadly or more difficult to treat. Explain why technology can be obtained, but you can divide what happens as a series of steps that reduce the impact of these genetic changes. By the way, the researchers also said that the virus does not need a new victim to transform. He's changing inside his host, even if he's never passed. Most mutations hurt the virus. You have to understand the basic truth about Ebola. From now on, there is no \"candy,\" and there are no drugs that kill Ebola. Doctors treat Ebola symptoms while the body fights the virus. In this regard, it's like the flu. Adam Loring is an assistant professor in the Department of Infectious Diseases and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan School of Medicine. Loring explained that since Ebola is a virus of the reindeer virus, every time a person reproduces, there is a high probability of small changes. But Loreg stressed that most changes do not strengthen the virus or make it more resistant to human defences. In fact, the typical mutation has the opposite effect. \"The data consistently available show that most newly emerging mutations in RNA viruses reduce fitness,\" said Lauring. \"This is, most mutations are made and then lost to the population. They don't hold on.\" So simply, the virus may change, but it doesn't really matter. Triange said that we must bear in mind that the Ebola virus works largely through the proteins it produces. The virus &apos; s genes make proteins and then proteins help the virus infect more body parts. And the ringing point is that with most mutations, genes produce protein that doesn't do what the virus needs and that version of the virus dies. Most mutations don't change anything with the virus itself repeating billions of times in one victim, some genetic drift will take hold. But in this group, there are two basic types: synonymous and not identical. The difference is how it affects proteins. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, \"Asymmetric mutations don't change protein sequence,\" said Loring. Remember, proteins determine how the virus works. If proteins remain the same, as well as the virus, for all practical purposes. (This is the cellular biology of that things are more complex.) Since abnormal mutations change proteins, we want to know how often these mutations occur in Ebola. Fortunately, a large team of researchers published a paper that goes directly to that point. Stephen Gerry, a researcher at the Sabity Laboratory at Harvard University, was a author. Jerry and his colleagues recently sampled 78 patients in Sierra Leone over a period of three weeks. When they dug into the virus genome, they found 40 mutations that occurred in \"protein code zones.\" Approximately one third were not identical. 14 were able to change proteins in the virus. The other 26 left the virus functionally as before. Of this group of 14, eight cases occurred in areas designated by Jerry that are functionally interesting. But Gerry confirmed, \"This doesn't necessarily mean that these mutations have changed or helped the virus.\" Without further research, Geyer said it was impossible to see whether these mutations had actually made the virus more successful as a living being, and more able to move from one person to another. The mutations may not be transmitted to others, and his colleagues have found that even mutations spread in the victim's bloodstream may not go anywhere. \"We have many cases where we see a mutation, but then there's no transmissions from that patient. This is due to the main theme of the Beck Statement. It is not a question of whether the virus is changing, but whether it is adapting to new environments and spreading in a new form. \"The divorce is not evolution,\" said Lauring. An official reminder does not mean that Ebola does not pose a serious threat. Gerry and his authors wrote that \"the continued progress of the epidemic can provide an opportunity for viral adaptation, At the end of the article, there is this dedication: \"It is interesting that five of the co-authors, who made a significant contribution to public health and research efforts in Sierra Leone, contracted EVD (Ebola) and lost their battle with the disease prior to the publication of this manuscript: Mohamed Fallah, Mballa Foni, Alex Muigboi, Alice Kovoma and S. \"We want to honor their memory\" We warned Governor Beck that every time a new person gets Ebola, it turns. First, transformation and repetition go hand in hand and injure a new person that does not change that. But the much bigger point is that Beck is drawing mutations with a wide brush. Most of them hurt the virus, and they're dead robots. Of those who do not actually hurt, about two thirds do not change how Ebola works. Of those who change how the virus works, there is no data to say whether functional change is important. However, the most recent study in West Africa found that many new species do not move to new victims. The Beck's statement on Ebola mutations is partially accurate, but it ignores important details. Accordingly, we value it half as valid.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07129"}
