Bob Cortes, R-Altamonte Springs, faced a series of questions from Rep. David Richardson, D-Miami Beach, after introducing HB 7101, one of several measures under consideration in the legislative session that would increase access to charter schools.\nLike public schools, charter schools receive state funds. The key difference is they are privately managed.\nRichardson was curious about the bill\u2019s provision that specifies that a charter school operator may use assets of their charter school for K-12 educational purposes in \"other schools.\"\n\"These other schools, would they also have to be a not-for-profit or could they be a for-profit?\" Richardson asked.\nCortes said, \"They would have to be a school within their own network. So part of the charter school system itself.\"\n\"So does that mean the other schools would have to be a 501(c)(3)?\" Richardson asked.\n\"All\u00a0charter schools are not-for-profit,\" Cortes said.\nCortes\u2019 bill passed in the House by an 81-39 vote.\nThe same argument resurfaced in debate of \"schools of hope\" legislation that would create a $200 million fund to lure charter schools to under-performing districts. Rep. Manny Diaz Jr., R-Hialeah, said, \"Under Florida state statute, a charter school is a non-profit organization, so there is no such thing in Florida as a for-profit charter school.\"\nThe statements jumped out to us because there\u00a0have been problems with charter schools being used to benefit people privately.\nFlorida law technically requires charter schools\u00a0to be nonprofits. But the system is largely run by for-profit companies, which Cortes' statement leaves out.\nNot-for-profit, or not?\nThe charter-school solution was originally touted as a way to give families \u2014 particular those in low-income areas \u2014 another option for schooling. Critics say too many taxpayer dollars have been shifted to the private companies that run charter schools to the detriment of traditional public schools.\nSo, are all charter schools in Florida not-for-profit? Technically speaking, a not-for-profit is a type of organization that does not earn profits for its owners.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCortes cited a provision of a Florida statute (1002.33 sec 12(i)) as evidence of this claim, which mandates that a charter must organize as, or be operated by, a nonprofit organization.\nThe Florida Department of Education echoed Cortes\u2019 evidence.\nAudrey Walden, the agency\u2019s press secretary, said the defining document that sets the academic, financial and organizational performance benchmarks for a charter school is determined by the local school district and the nonprofit charter school board.\nThe charter governing board can choose to enter into contracts with private entities to provide services and support.\n\"But, ultimately, performance and accountability rests with the nonprofit governing board -- which, when it enters into a charter agreement with its local school district, is subject to the same Sunshine Laws and School Accountability System that pertains to all public schools in Florida,\" she said.\nMore to the story\nNot all charter schools operate in the same way. And sometimes nonprofit charter governing boards enter into contract with for-profit companies.\u00a0The management company does not manage the governing board, but\u00a0rather it handles\u00a0certain aspects of the operations of the school under a contract with the governing board.\u00a0\nThe Miami Herald\u2019s examination of South Florida\u2019s charter school industry found several instances of for-profit management companies controlling charter schools\u2019 day-to-day operations. \u00a0\nThe Herald found examples of charter schools relinquishing total control of their staff and finances to for-profit management companies. In Miami-Dade County, the Life Skills Center paid 97 percent of its income to cover fees incurred by a management company.\nThen, the governing board of two affiliated schools tried to \"eject\" the management company\u2019s managers. As a result, the management company withheld money from the school and threatened to press charges against people within the school from trying to get it back.\nThe Herald also found that some owners of the management companies also control the land and buildings used by the charter school. Owners of Academica Corp., the state\u2019s largest charter school management company based in South Miami, collected almost $19 million a year in lease payments on school properties.\nIn other cases, it found that the school\u2019s nonprofit board were full of people with ties to the for-profit management companies.\u00a0\nThis trend continues across the nation.\u00a0ProPublica reported that several charter schools around the country funneled all of their revenue to a for-profit company hired for day-to-day operations including schools in New York and Ohio.\nA spokesman for the state's largest teachers union, the Florida Education Association, sent us a report that summarized the agency\u2019s arguments against\u00a0\"schools of hope\" legislation. The FEA isn\u2019t completely against charter schools, but its\u00a0website says,\u00a0\"While some charters adhere to the original idea, and have shown some success, many charters have become for-profit drivers for large corporations bent on taking over our public schools.\"\nOur ruling\nCortes said that all charter schools are not-for-profit.\nA Florida provision requires charter schools to be operated or controlled by a nonprofit organization. This technical talking point omits that many nonprofit charter school boards\u00a0enter in to contracts with for-profit companies. Some for-profit charter school management companies have drawn increasing scrutiny over the years for how they\u2019ve controlled the school\u2019s money.\nThis statement leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.\n Share the Facts 2017-04-27 16:26:21 UTC   Politifact    3 1 7  Politifact Rating: Half True  \"All charter schools are not-for-profit.\"    Bob Cortes State Representative   in a discussion on HB7101 Tuesday, April 18, 2017 2017-04-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03372"}
