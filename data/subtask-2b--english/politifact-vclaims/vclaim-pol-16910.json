MIT and Gates have \u2018created an ink that can be safely embedded in the skin alongside the vaccine itself, and it\u2019s only visible using a special smartphone camera app and filter.\u2019 This comes days after Gates stepped down from Microsoft\u2019s board.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has helped fund research into increased vaccine tracking, especially in under-resourced communities, but this post makes unsupported assertions and distorts the timeline of that research.\nLet\u2019s take a look.\n\u2018Invisible tattoos\u2019\u00a0\nResearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are seeking to address vaccine tracking challenges in developing countries by creating an invisible ink that could be injected into children along with vaccines.\nThe study began in July 2016, MIT told us, more than three years before the first novel coronavirus cases emerged. It was not inspired by the current outbreak.\nThe idea behind the research is that the dye would be visible under near-infrared light for up to five years and provide a quick, affordable way of helping health providers keep track of a child\u2019s vaccinations, even when paperwork gets lost or parents forget whether their child is up to date.\nThe dye wouldn\u2019t monitor people\u2019s habits or movements, as the Instagram post implies. It would essentially be a marker to see if someone received a vaccine upon inspection by a medical official.\n\nRELATED: Bill Gates warned in 2015 that we were unprepared for an infectious virus\u00a0\n\nResearchers say accurate vaccine record-keeping remains a major challenge in low-resource areas around the world, where \"well-maintained centralized databases do not exist,\" which \"contributes to 1.5 million vaccine-preventable deaths annually.\" Scientists hope an invisible, embeddable medical record that could accompany vaccines could help solve that problem.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gates Foundation has contributed funds for this research.\n\u2018Tracking bracelets\u2019\nSome governments such as Hong Kong are using electronic wristbands to track people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in order to enforce quarantines and reduce the spread of the virus.\nBut we find no evidence in news archives or other internet searches that Gates specifically stated he is \"pushing\" or advocating for the development of tracking bracelets.\nThe only mention of \"bracelets\" we could find associated with Gates came about in 2012, when the Gates Foundation funded a study into bracelets that would measure student engagement in classrooms.\u00a0\nThat said, Gates has said he supports the idea of a national tracking system to monitor the virus that causes COVID-19.\nIn a March 18 Ask Me Anything session on Reddit, Gates lauded South Korea\u2019s tracking system, which\u00a0 uses a smartphone app to gather information about COVID-19 spread. He said that, although thousands of tests are being offered per day at the University of Washington in Seattle, for example, \"no one is connected to a national tracking system\" and that \"whenever there is a positive test it should be seen to understand where the disease is and whether we need to strengthen the social distancing.\"\nWhen did Gates\u2019 interest in vaccination tracking begin?\u00a0\nGates has been interested in vaccinations and vaccination tracking, particularly in low-resource areas, for several years.\nHe stepped down from Microsoft\u2019s board of directors on March 13, 2020. And, as we mentioned, MIT\u2019s research into a vaccination-related invisible ink program has been going on for several years as well.\u00a0\nMIT published a study on its research on Dec. 18, 2019, in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The research was submitted to the journal in July 2019, and an MIT spokesperson told PolitiFact that it began back in 2016 \u2014 years before the first cases of the virus were reported.\nThe Gates Foundation told PolitiFact that it awarded a grant to MIT to improve the way childhood vaccinations are tracked; it had nothing to do with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak. Additional funding also came from the National Cancer Institute.\u00a0\n\"The researchers are exploring storing data in a pattern of dye, invisible to the naked eye, that is delivered under the skin at the same time as the vaccine. The technology is currently in the proof-of-concept phase,\" the foundation told PolitiFact in an email. \"If successful, governments could elect to incorporate this kind of tool in their immunization programs in place of, or in addition to, their current methods of tracking vaccinations.\"\nNone of the research is specific to America, as the Instagram post suggests. Nor is it tied specifically to COVID-19.\nOur ruling\nAn online post says that Bill Gates is pushing tracking bracelets and invisible tattoos to monitor Americans during the novel coronavirus pandemic.\nWe find no evidence that Gates has supported the concept of \"tracking bracelets.\" His foundation awarded a grant to MIT to study invisible dyes that could accompany vaccines to keep track of vaccinations in developing countries.\nBut this research began in 2016, and there is no evidence that it has anything to do with the current coronavirus pandemic, or to \"monitor\" Americans specifically.\u00a0\nThis post takes a small kernel of truth and frames it in a way that gives a misleading impression.
