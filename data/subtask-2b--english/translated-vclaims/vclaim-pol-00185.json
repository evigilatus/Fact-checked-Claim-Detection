She didn't do it.", "text": "This week, democratic presidential candidates and California Sen Kamala Harris pledged to take large oil and other powerful interests when they \"win from harmful behaviors\" like burning fossil fuels. In response to a direct question, she claimed that she had already done so as Attorney General of California. So, Senator Harris, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna sue them? - Sue Exxon Mobile? - Mm-hmm. I asked Director Erin Burnett. \"I've filed a lawsuit against Exxon Mobile,\" Harris replied. Did you? Environmental groups questioned their response. We decided to check it out. We found that Harris' office investigated Exxon in 2016 about allegations of lying to the public and his shareholders about the risks to his work caused by climate change. The Los Angeles Times dismissed that inquiry into a newspaper article in January 2016. She said that Exxon rejected the allegations. But there is no public record, and nothing the Harris campaign can provide, to show that it sued the company. The facts are Harris opened an investigation against Exxon for lying about climate change. Cassie Siegel, Director of Climate Affairs of the Biodiversity Centre &apos; s Work Fund, said. \"I've filed some lawsuits against oil companies.\" I'm not aware of a case you filed against Exxon. She did not file a case against Exxon for lying about climate change.\" In one interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"more water fell in Houston in five days than he went to Niagara Falls in one year.\" He told The New York Times, \"As a public defender (Harris), he sued Chevron, P.B., Kono Phillips and Philips 66 for pollution activities and helped earn $50 million in settlements.\" Sams provided Polyte Fact California with links to articles and newsletters supporting this work. In the verification of their facts, Times and CNN reported that they had found no evidence to support Harris' claim that she had filed an action against Exxon. Harris also opened a file shortly after the publication of Exxon News in autumn 2015. She didn't do anything to her, \"RL Miller, president of the California Democratic Party Environmental Caucus and head of the Super PAC climate hawk, said on Twitter during the city hall. Kamala Harris claimed in a modern climate city hall that she \"issued Exxon Mobile\" as California's Attorney General. It opened an investigation into the oil giant &apos; s case of allegations of lying to the public and its shareholders about climate change. But there is no public evidence, or any evidence from her campaign, that she filed a lawsuit against the company. Harris sued other oil companies and won settlements because they allegedly violated various state laws governing hazardous substances, according to the information provided by her campaign. But none of this involves a lawsuit against Exxon. It's clear that Harris has gotten involved with Big Oil as California E.J. There is no record that she sued one of the largest industry companies, Exxon. We assess her claim is wrong. - The statement is not accurate.
