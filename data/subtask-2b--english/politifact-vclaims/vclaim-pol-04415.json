The article said the tax would be paid by oil companies and gradually phased in over five years.\nTo be clear, the article said the proposal \"isn\u2019t expected to go far.\" And in a news release Ryan issued the same day as his tweet, he said the tax is \"dead on arrival in Congress.\"\nThe MarketWatch article quoted Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, as saying: \"This proposal would trickle down and be a $10 per barrel tax on motorists -- or 20 to 25 cents per gallon on refined fuels. To me it\u2019s clear: this is not something oil companies are going to absorb.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, 24 cents is in the range of the analyst\u2019s estimate. But it\u2019s only one analyst; and his estimate is based on how he thinks oil companies would respond to a $10-per-barrel tax.\nWhat the oil companies would do isn\u2019t quite as certain as what Ryan claimed.\nA trade group that should know, the American Petroleum Institute, warned the tax would \"harm consumers.\" But it hedged a bit in saying the tax \"could\" raise the cost of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon.\nEconomist Nicolas Loris estimated the cost slightly lower, at 22 cents, the Huffington Post said 22 to 24 cents, and the Washington Post said 24 cents. Politico and Forbes said about 25 cents.\nOne note: The federal government currently imposes a tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline. But that\u2019s a direct tax on gas, not on the oil companies.\nOur rating\nRyan said: \"President Obama\u2019s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon.\"\nEstimates are in the 24 cents range for the $10-per-barrel tax that Obama proposed on oil companies. But it\u2019s not a sure thing, if the tax became law, that all of the tax would be passed onto consumers.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/160d66f4-9b16-42c6-8bd7-c1c7d19868f1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04415"}
