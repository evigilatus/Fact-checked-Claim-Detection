A slew of chain emails and articles on conservative-leaning websites going back a year or more claim that the government\u2019s stockpile of ammunition reaches into the billions of rounds.\nThe claim:\nJames Buchal, an Oregon Republican challenging Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., clearly has concerns. His campaign website includes a photograph of an ominous-looking armored vehicle below copy in which Buchal says part of his campaign will \"focus on raising awareness of the threat to America\u2019s future posed by an out-of-control total surveillance state.\"\nHe adds, \"The government -- and not the armed forces -- is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use.\"\nIs the government stockpiling that much ammunition? PolitiFact Oregon checked.\nThe analysis:\nWe emailed Buchal, who pointed to a Government Accountability Office report released Feb. 12, 2014.\nThe report, \"Ammunition Purchases Have Declined Since 2009,\" was produced in response to questions from U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.\nIn a letter dated Nov. 13, 2012, Coburn wrote to Janet Napolitano, then the head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security: \"It has been reported that DHS has recently purchased large amounts of ammunition, as much or more than 1 billion rounds according to some estimates.\"\nSome claims put the figure at 1.6 billion rounds. Another set had it at 2.7 billion. Still others fretted about the alleged retrofitting of more than 2,700 heavily armored military vehicles that were going to be turned over to domestic police forces.\nThe GAO report found that as of October 2013, DHS had about 159 million rounds -- enough to meet the training and operational needs of its firearm-carrying personnel for about 22 months, it said. The agency has more than 70,000 armed personnel, the most of any federal agency, according to the report.\nThe Department of Justice is second with 69,000 armed personnel. The DOJ reported its ammunition inventory as enough to last from 13 to 20 months. The report did not translate that to specific figures but provided other information that enabled it to calculate a range of about 90 million to about 138 million rounds.\nTogether, those two agencies represent 80 percent of federal armed personnel, and together they have roughly 250 million to 300 million rounds of ammunition on hand.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Viral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat may be on the low end of the figure that pops to mind when someone says \"hundreds of millions,\" but Buchal\u2019s claim is accurate on the amount of ammunition the government has on hand.\nThen we looked at the thrust of Buchal\u2019s claim, that the government is \"stockpiling\" the ammunition for some later use.\nDHS\u2019s 159 million inventory in October was down from 178 million rounds in April 2013 and 193 million in November 2012, the GAO report found.\nWe emailed DHS\u2019s press office, which provided a statement saying DHS purchases dropped to 93 million rounds in fiscal 2012 and are projected at 75 million for fiscal 2014.\nFurther, the GAO reported that DHS\u2019 use of ammunition over the past six years has roughly equaled the amount it bought. In 2009, the agency bought 133 million rounds and dipped into reserves to use a total of 141 rounds. In 2013, the agency used 89 million rounds compared with new purchases of 84 million rounds.\nThe report noted that DOJ purchasing trends and usage rates are similar. It also said DOJ\u2019s inventories are below DHS\u2019s.\nHow is the ammunition used? The report noted that new federal officers go through 2,000 to 5,000 rounds a year, most of that in training and certification programs. Experienced officers use about 600 rounds a year.\nThe email from DHS concluded, \"Although a small reserve in terms of the overall ammunition is usually kept by the component law enforcement agencies, most do not have the capability to store large amounts of ammunition. There is not an ammunition stockpile.\"\nBuchal acknowledged the report\u2019s assertion that purchases have declined but added, \"The available information is not sufficient, at least to me, to demonstrate that the levels of ammunition purchases are appropriate.\" When asked, he did not make a distinction between an \"inventory\" and a \"stockpile.\"\nIn a final email, Buchal said the distinction may be beside the point.\n\"Bottom line, in all likelihood, the ammunition will only be used for training purposes, but engaging in such broad-scale training is itself a problem,\" he wrote. \"We don\u2019t need SWAT teams to deal with student loan fraud, and training up vast quantities of SWAT teams to deal with such issues is itself a sign of a growing divide between the government and the people.\"\nThe ruling:\nOn his campaign website, U.S. House candidate James Buchal claims that the government \"is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use.\"\nA government report indicated that the federal Department of Homeland Security, as of October 2013, had an estimated 159 million rounds in inventory, down from 178 million rounds in April 2013 and 193 million in November 2012. The report also found that DHS and Department of Justice -- which employ 80 percent of the federal government\u2019s armed personnel -- have steadily decreased ammunition purchases since 2009. Projected purchases by DHS for this year will be the lowest in more than five years. Estimated ammunition inventories for both agencies also continue to fall.\nWith inventories and purchases going down, and usage roughly equaling purchases, the government is clearly not \"stockpiling\" ammunition. And while Buchal is correct in his assertion that the government has \"hundreds of millions\" of rounds on hand, even he later acknowledged that \"in all likelihood,\" those rounds are being used for training purposes.\nWe rate the claim False.\nReturn to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this article.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07680"}
