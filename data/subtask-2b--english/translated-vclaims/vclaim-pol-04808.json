Looks like they all end up in chapter 11. \"His companies are bankrupt not once, not twice, but four times.\" We assessed a similar allegation from former Trump rival Carly Fiorina, mostly true, because it is not true to say that Trump is solely responsible for that. (For the record, Trump does not deny the charge and instead argues that it was a smart business decision. At that time we found four cases of bankruptcy, but since then we have found two more cases for a total of six. So Clinton was right that Trump broke the companies four times, and she could have offered a higher percentage as well. Let's go through them one by one. The number's bankruptcy. 1: Tramp Taj Mahal, his first bankruptcy in 1991, may have hit the businessman personally, the most difficult, according to news reports. He financed the construction of Tramp Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, N.J., which was opened in 1990. A year later, the casino owed about $3 billion, while Trump exceeded almost $900 million in personal liabilities. Trump therefore decided to apply for a reorganization of chapter 11, according to The New York Times. As a result, Trump gave up half of his personal share of the casino and sold his yacht and airlines, according to the Washington Post. The number's bankruptcy. 2: Tramp Castle, 1992, within one year of his first chapter 11 chapter, Trump found himself again in the bankruptcy court of Tramp Castle, which opened in 1985. It was \"his weakest casino,\" according to Philadelphia's detective, and faced ironically a competition from Trump Taj Mahal. In March 1992, the castle presented a pre-filled bankruptcy plan, and Trump gave up 50 percent of it in the casino for lower interest rates than $338 million in bonds. The number's bankruptcy. 3: Tramp Plaza and Casino, 1992 Hotel and Casino Tramp Plaza, Atlantic City, opened in 1984, was declared bankrupt at the same time as the castle. A joint venture between Tramp and Hare worth $210 million, the casino weighed its debt by $250 million by 1992, after the cash flow had dropped dramatically by 80 per cent. So Trump Plaza applied for bankruptcy that spring, too. The number's bankruptcy. On January 10, 2021, in the story of \"The Insubordination Act - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman - January 11, 2012 later that year, Tramp went bankrupt in another yard, this one in New York. Trump bought the Plaza Hotel in downtown Manhattan for $390 million in 1988, but accumulated over $550 million in debt by 1992. In December 1992, Trump gave up a 49 percent share in the Plaza for a total of six lenders, according to ABC News. Trump remained the Executive Director of the hotel, but it was just a gesture; he did not earn a salary and had no say in the day-to-day operations of the hotel, according to The New York Times. The number's bankruptcy. 5. The Tramp Hotel and the Casino Tramp resorts, 2004, have applied for bankruptcy again in 2004 when they accumulated on casinos - including the Trump Taj Mahal, Tramp Marina and Tramp Plaza in Atlantic City, and the Indiana River Boat Casino - a debt estimated at $1.8 billion, according to Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share of the company from 47 per cent to 27 per cent in the restructuring plan, but he was still the largest contributor to the company and remained responsible for its operations. At that time, Tramp Associated Press reported that the company represented less than 1 per cent of its net value.

Chapter 11 was declared in February 2009. After discussing the company's board of directors, Trump resigned as head of the company and his share of the company was reduced to 10 per cent. The company continued to use the name Trump in the licence. Whose fault is it anyway? The experts told us during the first season that Trump alone did not cause bankruptcy. While six in 25 years is a lot, five were linked to a struggling toy industry. They said Trump was acting like an investor. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they finance through debt sustainability, some of which inevitably demand bankruptcy, Adam Levitain, a professor of law at Georgetown University, who told us earlier. People usually did not personally blame former Republican presidential candidate Matt Romney or investor Warren Buffett for individual failures in their investment companies, Payne Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. \"The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means that people are connected to him, but he's not at all a leader in bankruptcy,\" said Levin. Our referee Clinton said that Trump sabotaged his companies not once, not twice, but four times. In fact, Tramp presented chapter 11 six times, four times in the course of two years in the 1990s, again in 2004 and again in 2009. But the experts told us that Trump should not take full responsibility, as the Clinton formula suggests, as most of the bankruptcys have occurred with the overall casino industry struggle.
