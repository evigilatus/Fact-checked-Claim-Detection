The post implies that the bombing was an attempt to stop the audit and cover up voter fraud.\n\"AT&T got a contract to do forensic audit on Dominion voting machines and those machines were being moved to Nashville this past week,\" one Dec. 27 post says. \"So, the explosion \u2018just happened\u2019 to be at the AT&T location where they \u2018just so happen\u2019 to control the cooling system for the super computer and house the dominion voting machines and drives for forensic audit\u2026\"\n\"Wait, the bombing in Nashville was at the AT&T data center right after they got the contract to audit the Dominion voting machines?,\" one from Dec. 26 reads. \"That\u2019s an interesting coincidence.\"\nBut none of this is true. AT&T does not hold a contract to audit Dominion\u2019s software or machines and did not have any of the company\u2019s equipment in its Nashville building.\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe FBI confirmed that a man named Anthony Warner was responsible for the bombing and was killed in the blast. The bomb was located in a recreational vehicle owned by Warner.\nThe explosion injured three other people and damaged businesses in downtown Nashville, including an AT&T switching center, which resulted in widespread communications outages.\u00a0\nLaw enforcement authorities have suggested that Warner may have been paranoid about 5G technology, a QAnon-related conspiracy theory that makes an array of unproven claims including that it helps spread COVID-19 and is used as a spying tool by the government.\u00a0\nSpokespeople for both AT&T and Dominion have confirmed that AT&T did not hold a contract to audit Dominion, nor had any of Dominion\u2019s equipment been moved to Nashville in preparation for such an audit.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Greer, associate vice president for corporate communications at AT&T, was blunt in an email response to PolitiFact: \"That is not true,\" he wrote.\nDominion representatives have also denounced the conspiracy theory, calling it another \"bizarre lie\" with \"zero credibility.\"\u00a0\nSome posts take the claim a step further, alleging that the former owner of the building was a board member of a firm that owns Dominion.\nHowever, the firm cited in that version of the claim \u2014 Cerberus Capital Management \u2014 doesn\u2019t own Dominion nor is it connected to Staple Street Capital, which acquired Dominion in 2018.\u00a0\nA public relations firm told the Associated Press on behalf of Dominion that the company \"has no connection to AT&T, the building, Nashville, family members of the Bidens or the Clintons, and Staple Street is not owned by Cerberus. These are conspiracies manufactured out of whole cloth.\"\nIn an email to PolitiFact, a Dominion spokesperson said the company and AT&T are calling on everyone to reject these baseless rumors: \"Americans should continue to seek information from verifiable, trusted sources, such as law enforcement authorities.\"\nOur ruling\nPosts online claim that the Christmas Day bombing in Nashville was an attempt to cover up election fraud because AT&T was conducting an audit of Dominion Voting Systems machines and that the equipment was recently relocated to the company\u2019s building that was damaged in the blast.\nThis is bogus. There is no evidence that suggests that the explosion was election-related. Both companies have denied the posts claims, saying that there was no such audit and that Dominion\u2019s machines were not recently transported to Nashville.\nPants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17319"}
