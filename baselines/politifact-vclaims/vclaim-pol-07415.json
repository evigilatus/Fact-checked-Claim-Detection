Rick Perry convened the grand jury that indicted him.\nWe can't judge Palin\u2019s corruption opinion. But the former Alaska governor's claim about the DA\u2019s connection to the grand jury is incorrect.\nPalin, in a commentary posted on the Fox News website Aug. 17, 2014, said: \"This ridiculous politically motivated \u2018indictment\u2019 of\" Perry \"stems from the ugly thug tactics of the \u2018politics of personal destruction\u2019 that the left is known for.\"\n\"First and foremost,\" Palin said, \"today's liberals have no shame. Case in point: Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg.\" Palin recapped Lehmberg\u2019s drunken driving conviction from 2013 and noted that Lehmberg refused to resign afterward.\n\"Lehmberg's D.A.\u2019s office runs the state\u2019s Public Integrity Unit, which prosecutes public crimes like government corruption,\" Palin wrote, and after Perry tried to get her to resign or face his veto of the unit\u2019s state funding, Palin said, Democrat Lehmberg\u2019s \"liberal supporters filed an ethics complaint against Perry...\"\nSubsequently, Palin wrote, the \"Travis County D.A.'s Office, still under Lehmberg, convened a grand jury, and \u2013 surprise, surprise! \u2013 Perry was \u2018indicted.\u2019\"\nIt\u2019s a fact that a liberal-leaning group, Texans for Public Justice, which monitors the influence of money in state politics and the courts, submitted a complaint to the Travis County district attorney\u2019s office on June 14, 2013 about Perry\u2019s actions. The complaint was submitted a day after the Austin American-Statesman revealed Perry was threatening to veto a $7.5 million, two-year appropriation to the Public Integrity Unit, housed in the district attorney\u2019s office, unless Lehmberg resigned. Texans for Public Justice\u2019s complaint alleged that the threat amounted to a violation of state laws prohibiting coercion of public officials.\nThe day the complaint came in, Gregg Cox, the attorney who heads the Public Integrity Unit, told the Statesman that Lehmberg\u2019s office would not investigate it. \"It\u2019s clear, it would not be appropriate for us to have any role in this,\" Cox said then.\nUpshot: Lehmberg subsequently recused herself from the matter, which ended up being overseen by a Republican judge from Bexar County and a San Antonio-based special prosecutor appointed by the judge, neither one picked by Lehmberg or her office.\nIn checking Palin\u2019s claim, we reached out to relevant judges and Lehmberg\u2019s office, finding no sign the DA\u2019s office played a role in convening or guiding the grand jury that indicted Perry.\nBy telephone, Bert Richardson of San Antonio, the senior state district judge overseeing the Perry case, and Republican Billy Ray Stubblefield, the Williamson County state district judge who appointed Richardson to oversee the review, declined to comment on Palin\u2019s claim.\nBut an Austin-based judge who momentarily managed the complaint and the Travis County assistant district attorney who works with most grand juries each said Lehmberg\u2019s office had no role in convening the grand jury that indicted Perry.\nJulie Kocurek, who presides over the 390th criminal district court in Travis County, called Palin\u2019s statement \"completely and absolutely false.\"\nAnd why?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKocurek said that after Lehmberg\u2019s office received the complaint about Perry, lawyers from the office brought it to Kocurek \u00a0in her capacity as presiding judge for the county\u2019s criminal district courts. The DA\u2019s office also brought a motion to recuse its attorneys from acting on the complaint because, Kocurek said, Lehmberg was obviously entangled. Similarly, Kocurek said, she recused herself as a judge in the matter given that she had worked for the DA\u2019s office in the past and continued to routinely work with Lehmberg on matters of criminal justice.\nIn accord with state law, Kocurek said, her next step was to turn the matter over to Stubblefield, \u00a0the presiding judge of the 3rd Judicial District that includes Travis County. Kocurek said Stubblefield then appointed Richardson, \"a very non-partisan straight-shooter judge,\" to handle proceedings involving the complaint. Richardson\u2019s job, she said, was to appoint an attorney to serve as the district attorney in the matter; that appointee, Michael McCrum of San Antonio, subsequently worked with the Travis County special grand jury named in April 2014 that ultimately indicted Perry. McCrum didn\u2019t respond to our telephone inquiry.\nRichardson, Kocurek said, sat in her courtroom to impanel the grand jury, which consisted of a dozen residents and two alternates drawn from a pool of 80 county residents created at random. \"They didn\u2019t know what case they\u2019d be hearing,\" Kocurek said.\nWe also drew a recap of the Perry matter from Lehmberg\u2019s office. Gary Cobb, director of the office\u2019s grand jury division, said by phone that when the TPJ complaint was received, the office recognized it couldn\u2019t reasonably handle the topic. \"Because of a clear conflict of interest, we didn\u2019t do anything but receive the complaint and recuse ourselves, putting in motion the process of having a special prosecutor assigned to it,\" Cobb said.\nThe office-wide recusal, Cobb said, was sought so that \"later on we wouldn\u2019t be accused of having some kind of undue influence.\"\nWe asked if Lehmberg\u2019s office played some role in choosing who would serve on the special grand jury that indicted Perry.\nCobb said not, adding that Richardson or Kocurek would have notified the district clerk\u2019s office that a pool of potential jurors, chosen randomly from adult residents of the county with a Texas driver\u2019s license or state-issued identification card, was needed on the date (April 14, 2014) Richardson wanted to impanel the grand jury.\nThe DA\u2019s office \"had no role\" in the grand jury\u2019s impaneling, Cobb said. \"We don\u2019t even show up.\" Generally, Cobb said, the office has no role in determining which residents are in the larger pool of potential jurors; that duty, he said, resides with the county\u2019s district clerk.\nAfter the special grand jury\u2019s initial three-month term ended, Cobb said, its term was extended another three months. \"They have a right and can request an extension for an additional three months in order to complete business,\" Cobb said. \"They did make the request and they did extend.\"\nGenerally, Cobb said, \"we went out of our way to make sure we didn\u2019t do anything that even gave the appearance of having any kind of involvement in the investigation for this case against Rick Perry,\" though occasionally the office had to coordinate schedules so different grand juries weren\u2019t simultaneously trying to occupy the room the county sets aside for grand juries.\nOur ruling\nPalin said that under Lehmberg, the \"Travis County D.A.\u2019s office\" convened the grand jury that indicted Perry.\nA special grand jury consisting of Travis County citizens indicted Perry in August 2014. But Lehmberg\u2019s office played no role in organizing the jurors. Early on, Lehmberg\u2019s office recused itself from handling the complaint that eventually resulted in the grand jury whose secret deliberations culminated in Perry\u2019s felony charges. A senior district judge from San Antonio, chosen by a judge based in Williamson County, impaneled the grand jury. The San Antonio judge picked a San Antonio lawyer to prosecute the case.\nWe rate this statement False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07415"}
