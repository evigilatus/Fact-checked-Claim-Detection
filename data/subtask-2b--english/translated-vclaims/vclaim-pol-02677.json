Sebastian Gorka, who left the White House in August, called Trump and Congress to withdraw the United States from his nuclear deal with Iran. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps should be included as a terrorist organization. On Monday, during a speech at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, Gorka took another step, saying that rebel groups such as Al-Qaida and the Islamic State, whose leaders were regarded as fundamental Sunni Muslims, were less dangerous than Iran, led by Shia fundamentalist Muslims. \"The much larger threat to America is, in fact, Shia Jihad - in the sense of Iran, meaning the Mullah. Not the people of Iran or Persians, but the Iranian Republican regime, \"said Gorka. \"Why? This is the regime of every Friday declaring war against us - war and destruction. That America and Israel must be destroyed.\" He raised his voice to confirm \"every Friday\" Does Iran's leaders declare war on the United States \"every Friday,\" as Gorka suggests? Trump and Iran's supreme leader have certainly been engaged in a war of words recently, with Trump calling a branch of the Iranian armed forces \"the corrupt personal terror force and militias.\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei replied to him, saying to the local media that Trump is \"disgusting\" and \"pretending to be an idiot.\" However, Polyte Fact asked whether Iran could be at war with the United States. (We feel like we'd be hearing about it now.) We contacted Gorka via e-mail and Twitter to ask him what he meant. It does not seem to expand on Iranian war announcements in a video of the speech delivered by Christians united for the Israeli Facebook group. Gorka responded by e-mail after this fact check was posted on the Internet. \"Is this supposed to be a joke?\" He said. \"Death to America is not a declaration of war? According to your experience? I've followed. \"Get real experts or just stop wasting my time.\" It is possible - even more likely - that Gorka was referring to Iranian officials shouting \"death to America\" during Friday prayers. This is not the first time that Politi Fuckett has looked at the cheers of \"death to America\" by Iranian officials, or the country's views on America. In 2015, Ted Cruz claimed that Iran celebrates every year \"the Day of Death of America\" - a claim that we often ruled wrong. Gary Seck, a scientist at the Middle East Institute at Columbia University, told Paulette Fuckett at the time that he shouted \"every Friday at the weekly prayers held throughout Iran.\" In fact, experts say that some Iranians were shouting \"death to America\" at Friday prayers for decades, dating back to the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. As early as August, Associated Press reported that members of the Iranian Parliament had shouted at it when they voted to increase spending on the country &apos; s ballistic missile programme and foreign operations of its paramilitary revolutionary guards. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 February 1, 2012, but experts say that cheers are not intended to show the country's intentions in physical harm to Americans. In 2015, Fuad Azdi, Assistant Professor at the Faculty of World Studies at the University of Tehran, interpreted international public radio that the logo should be interpreted as \"death to American foreign policy.\" He said that Iranians \"have problems with the American government, not with the American people.\" Kevin Harris, Assistant Professor at the University of California, author of a book on Iranian politics, agreed: \"For me - I was at the \"Revolution Day\" parade in Tehran, as well as Friday prayers at the University of Tehran where the main political discourse is being delivered - it is the political scene.\" Harris compared it to Trump's claims in August that he would fire and rage against North Korea if it continued to threaten the United States. Harris said that there were \"a lot of moderate Iranian politicians\" who preferred diplomacy. However, statements making American news headlines often come from \"some politicians in Iran with a loudspeaker who tries to outsmart his competitors by saying something outrageous.\" Aleriza Nader, Senior Policy Analyst of Rand, echoed Harris &apos; s point of view. \"As he is hostile, that does not mean Iran declares war against the United States every Friday,\" said Nadir. The United States and Iran may be competitors, but there is also a history of cooperation between the two, including on the nuclear issue. A declaration of war is one thing to wish for worse than your political enemies. Among other things, the war against another country has been officially declared. Harris, Professor of the University of California, says that article 110 of the Iranian Constitution gives powers of war to the office of the Supreme Commander - who has not declared war on the United States \"in fact, the Iranian Supreme National Security Council is taking decisions on foreign policy - even the Foreign Minister is cute when journalists ask him.\" Harris said. And Polly Fuckett didn't find any news reports of the commander-in-chief who declared the war. Can Iran's actions be interpreted as war? Riza Marashi, Director of Research at the American-Iranian National Council, notes that Iranian funds and resources are involved in fighting throughout the region. In fact, the United States Department of State has listed Iran as the first country to sponsor terrorism for many years. Iran, reports PBS, supported \"anti-Israel groups as well as agents who have destabilized the already devastating conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\" The country also \"continued to recruit Shia militia members in Afghanistan and Pakistan to fight in Syria and Iraq.\" But Marashi does not refer to any of this activity, which means that the State declared war on the United States \"It is fair to point out that Iran participated in proxy wars, for example in Syria,\" said Marashi. \"But, frankly, they are no different from Saudi Arabia or even the United States.\" The governor Gorka said that the Iranian regime \"proclaims war\" against America \"every Friday.\" The prayers approved by the government on Fridays sometimes include the cheers of \"Death to America.\" Experts say that these cheers are rhetoric, not dangerous declarations of war. Iran has not officially declared war on the United States even once, let alone weekly. We appreciate Gorka's claim that it is false.
