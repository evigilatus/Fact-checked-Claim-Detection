Here's Trump tweet: Trump made this allegation on Sunday during a flood of tweeting about voter fraud. The President-elect also said that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for \"millions of people who voted illegally\" This claim was examined and evaluated by Poletti Fact National Company with pants on fire. We decided to verify Trump's claim about \"serious voter fraud\" in California. Our search for Trump didn't provide any evidence of voter fraud in California in the chain of tweeting. On Monday, the spokesman for Tramp Jason Miller cited a national study conducted by the Pew Research Centre which found that some 24 million voter registrations in the United States were no longer valid or inaccurate. However, no evidence emerged from Trump's office of \"serious voter fraud\" in California. Trump may have relied on an unsupported claim that 3 million \"illegal aliens\" voted in this year's elections. This allegation was made on Twitter by Greg Phillips, who worked for the Republican Party and has an application to report voter fraud. Polyte Fact stated that Philips did not disclose any supporting evidence and indicated that the media undermined his statements. His claim was mistakenly assessed. In November 8 in California, election errors were reported, such as false names placed on some absent ballot papers and long lines in some polling places. However, state and local electoral officials, along with independent observers, say that there have been no reports of large-scale fraud of voters in the state. \"His allegations are unfounded,\" stated California Foreign Minister Alex Padilla in an interview. \"I believe that it is a great harm for our country and for our democracy to continue to raise these doubts. If there is anything, the message back to Mr. Trump is, if you have evidence, if you have evidence, please present it forward. There are procedures in place to investigate any real voter fraud. However, as evidence has shown, cases of voter fraud throughout the country are statistically minimal if you go back decades.\" The Padilla office was unable to report immediately the number of complaints of voter fraud received in connection with these general and previous elections. Hillary Clinton had 3.9 million votes on Trump on 28 November, a margin that grew significantly as California continued to count many absent ballots in the state. In a statement in response to the Tramp tweet, Dean Logan, President of the California Association of Clerks, Electoral Officials and Senior Election Officials in the Los Angeles District, in a statement in response to the Trump tweet, said that the state had \"a history of delicate and accountable elections.\" Logan described Trump's fraudulent claims as \"broad allegations.\" Logan added in an e-mail to Polyte Fact California that: \"The adequacy of complaints or allegations of voter fraud is not a specific data set that we track. This alone may give you a sense of hesitation, but there is no indication that the rate of concern on this issue was higher in this election cycle than in any other cycle.\" On January 28, 2021 in Facebook blog, bloggers tried to \"close\" the California government's summoning campaign. \u2219 (Gavin Newsom) \u2022 On February 2, 2012, he added that there were legal avenues to challenge the voter's eligibility. But none of them were used before or after the elections, as he said. \"I think this kind of goes to the point that there's nothing to support those allegations,\" said Logan. The assistant voter registrar in Sacramento Alice Garbo said about more than 530,000 voters in the districts that appeared on election day, none of whom filed a complaint about voter fraud. Garbo, who worked in the department for 18 years, said there were no complaints of \"base\" for the elections in her district. She added: \"I have never seen anything (in relation to voter fraud) that would affect the outcome of the election -- at all.\" Kim Alexander, President of the California Voters Foundation, a non-profit voter advocacy group, said that she had not seen evidence of serious voter fraud. \"There is no perfect system -- people make mistakes,\" Alexander said. However, she added that California &apos; s voter verification laws were one of the country &apos; s strongest laws. It noted that each province was automatically required to re-screen part of the ballots by hand. The State also prohibited paperless electronic voting, a kind of vote that made audits almost impossible. The unsupported Tramp allegation of voter fraud in California may also be based on misleading information on two recent state laws: AB60, which allows undocumented migrants to obtain State leadership licences; and the new voter law, which by mid-2017, will automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain a driver &apos; s licence or renew it. Automatic registration applies only to citizens who are already eligible to vote, and not to undocumented migrants. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of California, Padilla, said that the new system would require potential voters to display identity such as birth certificate or passport to express their nationality before registering them. In most cases, voters in California are not required to establish their identity at polling stations. Our government, Donald Trump, claimed that \"serious voter fraud\" occurred on California election day. He did not provide any evidence to support his statements and his press team did not specifically respond to a request for fraud in the state. Electoral officials and impartial observers in California said that there were no widespread reports of voter fraud. The State has some of the most stringent voter verification laws in the country. The allegations of fraud are so rare that L.A. County, the largest county in the state, does not track them. The Politi Fakt New Hampshire newspaper examined Trump's claim that the Ghanaian State also witnessed \"serious voter fraud.\" The Trump statement was described as \"an unsubstantiated claim\" and assessed by fire pants after it found that \"no complaints of voter fraud were filed in elections in which more than 728,000 ballots were cast.\" The Tramp allegation of voter fraud in California is also reckless and unsubstantiated. We evaluate it with pants on fire. Pants on fire - The statement is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous allegation.
