In one case, Ken criticized the Trump position on nuclear proliferation. Ken claimed Trump said, \"More countries must have nuclear weapons.\" Try to defend it.\" Pines said, \"Well, he never said that, Senator.\" \"I've certainly said it,\" said Ken. Saudi Arabia. South Korea Japan.\" Trump &apos; s declared positions on nuclear proliferation are often contradictory, and we have therefore decided to present them to you here. But it is clear from reading these exchanges that Trump believes that the development of their nuclear weapons by South Korea and Japan may not be bad, given the threat posed by North Korea. The spokesman for Tramp Stephen Chung said: \"Mr. Trump has pointed out that countries need to defend themselves and that nuclear weapons are their choice, but not their support for the possession of such weapons.\" The following are some of Tramp &apos; s main comments on whether more countries should have nuclear weapons. In March 27, 2016, The New York Times asked Trump whether he objected to the possession of nuclear weapons by Japan or South Korea, given their proximity to North Korea. Trump answered: \"At some point, we can't be the police of the world. Unfortunately, we have a nuclear scientist now. And yours, Pakistan has them. North Korea probably owns them. And I'd rather North Korea have with Japan sitting there too? You might be better off if that's the case. In other words, Japan is defending itself against North Korea, a real problem.\" Later in the same interview, he added: \"If Japan has this nuclear threat, I am not sure it would be bad for us.\" On March 29, 2016, Anderson Cooper of CNN Trump asked, \"If you're worried about proliferation, and allowing other countries to acquire nuclear weapons, isn't that proliferation?\" As part of a sudden response, Trump said that he was opposed to nuclear proliferation (\"No, no, not proliferation). I hate nuclear weapons more than anything else, \"I don't want any more nuclear weapons\" and some countries support the acquisition of nuclear weapons for the first time. On January 13, 2021, General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We don't work for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, \"Aren't Japan supposed to have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?\" He asked Cooper. As Cooper Trump asked, \"Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?\" Trump: \"Saudi Arabia, of course.\" Cooper: \"Are you okay with having nuclear weapons?\" Trump: \"No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves, or they have to pay us.\" On April 3, 2016, Chris Wallace asked Chris Trump: \"Do you want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?\" Trump: \"In many ways, I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Now, you have Pakistan, North Korea, you have China, you have Russia, you have India, you have the United States and many other countries with nuclear bombs.\" Trump later added Japan and South Korea, \"They might be better off - including with nuclear bombs, yes, including nuclear bombs.\" On May 4, 2016, Wolf Blitzer asked CNN Trump: \"You're willing to allow Japan and South Korea to become nuclear powers?\" Trump answered: \"I am ready, if they will not take proper care of us, we cannot afford to be the military and police of the world.\" The governor, Benes, said Trump never said that more countries should have nuclear weapons. Trump said that some countries, Japan and South Korea, might be \"better off\" if they developed nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. However, he also said - often in the same interview - that he was opposed to nuclear proliferation in general. We value Pines &apos; claim that it is often false. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/643323b9-c5bf-4065-bbb-de57669277df", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04205"}
