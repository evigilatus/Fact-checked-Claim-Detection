Jim Sensenbrenner says U.S. has \"highest corporate tax rate in the world\"", "text": "With unemployment remaining stubbornly high, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., was asked what the federal government could do to create jobs.\n\nThe suburban Milwaukee congressman, who was first elected to the House in 1979, didn\u2019t hesitate in replying.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got to address the fact that we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world,\" Sensenbrenner told the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Sept. 29, 2011. \"It\u2019s 35 percent.\"\n\nSensenbrenner argued that if corporate taxes in the U.S. were lower than they are in other parts of the world, more U.S.-based multinational companies would \"repatriate\" their profits back to America, creating more jobs here.\n\nIt\u2019s Sensenbrenner\u2019s opinion that lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate would create jobs. We can\u2019t check an opinion.\n\nBut we can check whether the rate is 35 percent and if it is the highest in the world.\n\nSensenbrenner\u2019s district director, Loni Hagerup, pointed to a 2011 report from the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development, a Paris-based group of 34 large, industrialized democracies.\n\nThe widely quoted report says the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent, tops among the member countries.\n\nNext in line were France and Belgium (both 34 percent), and then Australia, Japan, Spain and Mexico (each 30 percent). \u00a0\n\nSeems pretty straightforward. Sensenbrenner is right, right?\n\nLet\u2019s first look at two points:\n\n1. \"Combined\" corporate tax rate\n\nSome analysts, when comparing countries, use the Paris group\u2019s report but cite a different figure -- the combined corporate tax rate, rather than merely the corporate tax rate. The combined rate includes not only federal but also state tax rates for corporations. The combined corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 39.2 percent, which ranks second behind Japan\u2019s 39.5 percent.\n\nBut Sensenbrenner was asked what the federal government could do to create jobs, so the corporate tax rate -- not the combined rate -- is relevant here.\n\n2. Limitations of the corporate rate\n\nWe consulted experts at two Washington, D.C. research organizations -- Tax Foundation president Scott Hodge and Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Both said Sensenbrenner is correct in stating that the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent and that the rate is the highest in the world, but they added some context to the discussion.\n\nWilliams said the corporate tax rate \"is not a good measure of the taxes that corporations actually pay.\" While some corporations might pay the full 35 percent rate, many pay considerably less, depending on the types of investments they make, depreciation they take and other factors that reduce taxable income, he said.\n\nHodge agreed. He added, however, that the \"effective\" federal tax rate (after deductions) that corporations pay is about 26 percent -- and that also is among the highest rates of all industrialized nations.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nAsked what the federal government could do to create jobs, Sensenbrenner said lower the \"corporate tax rate,\" which he said was 35 percent and the highest in the world. A widely quoted annual report says the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent and is highest among 34 large, industrialized countries. Two experts agreed with the rate and the ranking.\n\nWe rate Sensenbrenner\u2019s claim True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12303"}
