Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters said no, Sanders was the clear winner, evidenced by a CNN poll that showed most people thought Sanders was best.\nThe problem: CNN deleted the poll.\nThe theory: CNN deleted the poll to so as not to counter its narrative that Clinton won.\nA video by NowThis, which shares GIFs and video stories by social media, picked up on a\u00a0Reddit\u00a0theory and promoted\u00a0this video\u00a0on Twitter and\u00a0Facebook, teasing, \"It looks like CNN is trying to help Hillary look good, even if that means deleting polls.\"\nHere\u2019s part of the script that was seen by millions: \"The Internet thinks Bernie Sanders totally won the debate. But CNN thinks Hillary won. Even though CNN\u2019s own polls say Bernie won by 68 percent. But that doesn\u2019t concern them. They allegedly just deleted the polls.\"\nThe video suggests CNN \"deleted the polls\" showing Sanders won because CNN\u2019s parent company, Time Warner, is \"one of Hillary\u2019s biggest donors,\" spending more on her campaign than \"Bernie\u2019s top 15 donors gave him.\"\nThis is just one example of a viral claim.\nFor now, we will skip the part about the conspiracy that focuses on Time Warner\u2019s campaign donations, because there\u2019s a fundamental flaw with these posts.\nCNN didn\u2019t delete its poll.\nThe poll showing Sanders way ahead is\u00a0here\u00a0on Facebook through\u00a0CNN.com/vote.\u00a0It\u2019s not on CNN\u2019s website, but it\u2019s not clear that it ever was on CNN\u2019s website.\u00a0\nThe original link does not appear to be working on some mobile devices.\u00a0Try this link\u00a0if you are having problems with the links above. It should take you to a log-in screen and\u00a0then show the poll, which has closed.\nCNN\u2019s digital team used a Facebook app to run live polls of users about what they thought of the debate as it was happening.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN anchor Don Lemon reported\u00a0on the strong show of support for Sanders from CNN\u2019s Facebook Lounge on debate night.\n\nLemon mentioned how Facebook users thought Sanders excelled on foreign policy, economic issues and overall debate performance.\nSo not only did CNN not delete the poll, but the news channel also did not hide it.\nIt might be obvious, but these are clearly non-scientific polls.\nNowThis attempted to correct its report on Facebook by posting this update on the video\u2019s\u00a0comment stream: \"Clarification: This was an unofficial social media user poll, and CNN says it's still live on their web site and Facebook page.\"\u00a0\nBut again, you don't have to take CNN's word for it that the post wasn't deleted, and NowThis can't hide behind the use of the word allegedly. The poll is\u00a0here\u00a0for anyone to see. Here's a screengrab we took Oct. 19:\n\nOur ruling\nSanders supporters are free to disagree with analysis by journalists and pundits of who won the Democratic debate.\nWhat isn\u2019t up for debate, however, is the fact that CNN did not delete its poll of Facebook users, who overwhelmingly said Sanders won the debate. It\u2019s still on a Facebook page managed by CNN.\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.\nWe've updated this fact-check to account for some of the issues we've heard from users about opening the links.
