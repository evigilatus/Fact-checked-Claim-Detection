Mike Parson beginning the first phase of his \"Show Me Strong Recovery Plan.\"\n\n\nIn an April 27 tweet, Parson said, \"All Missouri businesses can open Monday, May 4, under our new order as long as new guidelines are followed.\"\n\nBut not all Missouri businesses were able to reopen.\n\nCounties and cities in the state had extended stay-at-home orders past the May 4 date Parson had in mind for a Missouri reopening.\n\n\nSt. Louis County, the hardest-hit county in the state, and the city of St. Louis had stay-at-home orders in place until Monday. Their policies were based on\u00a0Health Commissioner Fredrick Echols\u2019 Order No. 7, which was dated April 16, and were in place at the time the governor announced the first phase of reopening.\nKansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas\u00a0signed an extension of the stay-at-home order\u00a0on April 16. That order was set to expire on May 15. Some businesses began opening up May 6. According to KCUR/89.3FM, movie theaters won\u2019t open up there until at least June.\n\n\nJackson County (not including Kansas City), began reopening May 10.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Columbia and surrounding Boone County, the health director extended a stay-at-home order three days before the governor\u2019s tweet.\u00a0Bars, nightclubs, movie and music theaters are still closed. A judge on Friday\u00a0rejected a request for a temporary restraining order to block the restrictions.\n\nSo, have all businesses been able to open in Missouri? No, it\u2019s more complicated than that.\n\n\nWe reached out to Parson\u2019s office. While acknowledging our email, there was no information provided. In\u00a0a radio interview with KFTK/97.1 FM in St. Louis on April 29, Parson noted he did not have the power to make counties comply with the reopening plan, but he could exert \"political pressure\" to do so. Parson\u2019s order was a minimum, allowing for localities to make more restrictive measures.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nIn a tweet April 27, Parson said, \"All Missouri businesses can open Monday, May 4, under our new Order as long as new guidelines are followed.\"\n\n\nWere all Missouri businesses open? The short and long answer is no. Localities had extended restrictions on businesses before Parson\u2019s tweet. Although most businesses were allowed to open, some weren\u2019t.\n\n\nWe rate Parson\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18346"}
