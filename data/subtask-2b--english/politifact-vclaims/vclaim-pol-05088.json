The state\u2019s March 15 primary was \"winner-take-all,\" which means all of the delegates went to one winner, who ended up being Trump.\n\"You speak about what\u2019s unfair, so in Florida you had 99 delegates,\" he said in a speech in Rome, N.Y. \"And Jeb Bush had it set -- Jeb Bush or Rubio, both of them. They had it set so that the winner takes everything, because they wanted to make sure that I didn't get anything.\"\nDid Bush and Rubio set the Florida primary for winner-take-all because they wanted to prevent Trump from getting any delegates?\nRepublican officials did hope a winner-take-all primary would benefit Bush or Rubio, but Trump gets some of his key facts wrong.\nWho decided winner-take-all\nIn February 2015, state Sen. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, chair of an elections committee, announced that he would introduce a bill to set Florida\u2019s presidential primary on March 15, 2016.\nIn the primaries of 2008 and 2012, Florida had gone rogue with its primary date, with state GOP legislators setting the date of Florida\u2019s primary earlier than national leaders wanted. (Early states like Iowa and New Hampshire are picky about other states\u2019 primary dates.) In 2012, national leaders punished Florida by taking away half of its delegates. The March 15 date for 2016 meant Florida was back to following the national party\u2019s suggestions.\n\"We want Florida to be meaningful and relevant in the presidential elections,\" Richter told the Miami Herald in February 2015. \"We don't want to come under any penalties and we want to have the candidates come to Florida and actively campaign.\"\nRichter also said at the time that it would help Florida\u2019s favorite sons -- Bush, a former governor, and Rubio, a U.S. senator, if they decided to run. (Rubio announced in April and Bush announced in June.)\nRichter told PolitiFact Florida that leading up to introducing his bill \"I had absolutely no conversations whatsoever with Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio or any of their representatives or campaign or anything.\"\nBecause the state was back to following the rules on the date, it had an option whether to set the primary as winner-take-all or to award delegates proportionally. State officials decided to go with winner-take-all.\nBut Richter said that there were no conversations among leadership or the Senate about Trump when setting winner-take-all.\n\"Not once did Trump\u2019s name come up at any point in time,\" he told PolitiFact Florida.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, the winner-take-all choice was talked about as a gift to Bush, who was viewed as the top Florida candidate early on.\n\"The winner-take-all primary was a very good thing for Jeb -- before Marco got in,\" Ana Navarro, a Bush supporter told the Tampa Bay Times in May 2015. \"When people, including me, were calling their legislators, telling them to make it winner-take-all, we were all still under the mistaken impression that Marco wasn't going to run.\"\nThe bill sailed through the Legislature unanimously, and Gov. Rick Scott signed it March 19, 2015. (This was months before Trump\u2019s June announcement that he would be running.)\nOn May 16, the Republican Party of Florida\u2019s Executive Board formally accepted the state plan and announced a winner-take-all election. (The board voted unanimously, including vice chair Joe Gruters, who would later go on to be Trump\u2019s co-chair.)\n\"Florida will now be the first winner-take-all primary in the country, this ensures that all presidential campaigns will have to spend a considerable amount of time in Florida speaking to Republicans from Pensacola to Key West and everywhere in-between,\" said party chair Blaise Ingoglia.\nPolitiFact Florida asked Gruters: Is there any proof that Bush or Rubio had winner-take-all set?\n\"Not that I\u2019m aware of,\" he said. \"My guess is they wouldn\u2019t have to. Looking at all the (Republican) people voting in the Legislature, they were 80 percent Bush guys and the other 20 percent were Rubio guys.\"\nWe found no evidence that state legislators and party officials were even thinking about Trump when they were setting the date.\nTrump said he might run in January 2015 and started giving speeches, including at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February.\nIt wasn\u2019t until July -- the month after Trump announced his candidacy \u00a0-- that the New York billionaire started to lead in many national polls.\nIt was clear that Florida Republican powerbrokers hoped that winner-take-all would help Bush or Rubio win. But in the end, that wasn\u2019t the case. Bush suspended his campaign a few weeks before Florida\u2019s primary and Rubio ended up only winning his home county of Miami-Dade while Trump swept the rest of the state.\nBush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said that Bush \"had no role at all\" in setting the winner-take-all system. \u00a0A spokesman for Rubio declined to respond.\nOur ruling\nTrump says that Bush and Rubio \"had it set so that the winner takes everything, because they wanted to make sure that I didn't get anything\" in the Florida primary.\nIt wasn\u2019t Bush or Rubio who set those rules for the March 15, 2016, primary. It was the Florida Legislature that passed the bill setting the date, allowing the state GOP to decide whether to make it winner-take-all.\nBy that point, Trump was a potential candidate, but he wasn\u2019t seen as a major threat to Rubio or Bush -- especially in Florida -- at that point.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement False.\n\u00a0https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ef0a3218-a00f-4779-83b7-9ca0a4a90676", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05088"}
