But the photo is from spring 2012, a period when gas prices spiked.\nThe prices shown in the photo were also $1.70-plus more than the weekly retail price for a gallon of gas on average in the U.S., which was $3.79 on May 7, 2012.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas prices fluctuate often, regardless of who is president at the time. Several experts maintain that unless the president is directly controlling gasoline prices, he cannot take credit for the cost.\nSeverin Borenstein, the director of the Energy Institute at the Haas School of Business University of California Berkeley, told PolitiFact presidents have \"very little direct influence\" over gas prices.\n\"By far the biggest driver is the price of crude oil, which is driven by supply and demand factors,\" he said. \"A strong global economy, which presidents can influence slightly, is likely to increase demand and drive up prices. The economic growth out of the financial crisis was part of what drove high gasoline prices in 2012-14, just as the pandemic-driven global recession is now keeping oil prices very low.\"\nA comprehensive look at gas prices during both the Obama and Trump administrations revealed that average gas prices for the entire country varied greatly.\n\nOn average, the weekly regular retail gas price during the Trump administration was about $2.50 per gallon, which is less than the average weekly regular retail price during the Obama administration \u2014 about $2.97 per gallon.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post includes an image of an Exxon sign that lists gas prices at more than $5 per gallon and says, \"Just a reminder of what things looked like the last time Biden was in the White House.\"\u00a0\nIt is a real photo of the price of gas at a Washington D.C. Exxon station in May 2012, when Obama and Biden were in office. However, the photo was taken when gas prices were spiking and shows a price that was still well above the average cost of a gallon of gas in the U.S. at that time.\u00a0\u00a0\nGas prices fluctuate regardless of who the president is. The average price during the Obama years was $2.97 a gallon.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18602"}
