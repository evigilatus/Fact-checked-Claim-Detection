It was a familiar theme on the track of the election campaign, in television advertising and during discussions in one of the most visible Senate races in the country. :: During the first three television discussions on October 24, 2014, Shahin, a democracy, took her to Republic Brown, saying that he voted to grant tax exemptions to companies moving jobs abroad. \"One of the problems with our tax code is that we encourage companies to outsource our jobs. We're actually offering tax exemptions to companies that ship jobs abroad,\" Shaheen said directly to Brown. \"When I was in the Senate, I voted to reward those companies for shipping jobs abroad.\" Brown had a definitive response: \"I've never voted for outside work.\" The exchange looked like a work for Polly Fuckett. In this item, we will consider Shaheen's claim that Brown is a \"vote to reward\" companies for shipping jobs abroad. As evidence of this, Shaheen's campaign referred to Brown's vote on a 2010 draft law submitted by Mr. Dick Dorbin, D-IL., called the American Job Creation and Immigration Elimination Act (S. 3816). The bill aims to provide companies with incentives to return jobs abroad to the United States and to reduce tax exemptions that companies may benefit from when moving jobs abroad, in accordance with a legislative summary issued by the Library of Congress. In some cases, the 2010 measure would have set aside the company &apos; s choice to postpone taxes on profits from goods manufactured abroad but sold here. The bill attracted opposition from major business and industry groups as well, including the United States Chamber of Commerce and Coach Industries, both registered to press the bill. R. Bruce Justin, Executive Vice-President for Government Affairs of the American Chamber of Commerce, who now supports Brown in the race, wrote. However, the concept of economic growth is not a zero-sum game. The replacement of a post based in another country with a domestic job does not stimulate economic growth or enhance the competitiveness of American firms around the world.\" In the past, Polyte Fact reviewed a claim from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., a co-sponsor of S.3816, which stated that the country &apos; s tax law allowed companies to deduct the costs of offshoring. This statement was found to be correct. Shaheen voted yes, Brown voted no. But he's got some cover. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job. But on January 15, 2021 first, while the purpose of the Durbin Bill was \"to create American jobs and prevent the transfer of such jobs abroad,\" he did not get any upward or downward votes. The bill was completed by a procedural vote to end the debate, known as the crack. It obtained only 53 of the 60 votes required to close the debate and move to a final vote up or down. Senators voted mostly according to party lines: 52 out of 57 Democrats voted yes (no one voted) and 40 out of 41 Republicans voted no (no one voted). The room has been divided separately. So Brown never voted on the merits of this procedure. However, Brown publicly criticized the bill on 27 September 2010 - the day before the Senate vote - saying that it would harm job creation and the economy. \"Mr. President, this law on Earth tonight is not about job creation. He said at that time about the campaign and November. \"They want to call us a party \"No - I get it. Some polls say they play a good role in the country when politicians talk about \"ship companies operating abroad.\" I understand that too. He added: \"The main employer in Massachusetts, to whom I spoke, said that such suggestions were like getting a small piece of candy with one hand and hitting with a slide hammer with the other.\" The second part of Brown's coverage is that Shaheen is a little overreacting when she says that Brown is a \"vote to reward\" companies \"to ship jobs abroad.\" As mentioned earlier, there is no tax exemption or gap specifically addressing outsourcing or outsourcing of employment. When Democrats refer to \"tax cuts\" for outsourcing, they usually refer to standard cuts in commercial expenditures. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax deductible - including transportation. This provision of the Tax Code does not target businesses moving outside the United States. Business will get the same discounts for the money he spent from New York to California. Our judgment Jane Shaheen says Scott Brown voted to reward companies for shipping jobs abroad. A bill in the Senate in 2010 called the United States Job Creation and Outward Transportation Act aimed at providing companies with incentives to return jobs abroad to the United States and to reduce tax exemptions that could benefit companies moving jobs abroad. In a procedural vote to move the bill forward, Shahin voted in favour of the bill and Brown against it. Brown expressly opposed the bill in a speech, but his actual vote was procedural - not merit - and it is controversial whether his opposition equates with \"equivalent\" companies that contract abroad or simply maintain the status quo that treats all companies equally. In short, we find that the saying of Shaheen is half correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07041"}
