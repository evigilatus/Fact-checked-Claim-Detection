Limbaugh was going off on a Huffington Post blog written by Carolyn Gregoire. In her post, Gregoire criticized a Cadillac commercial as over-materialistic.\nHere\u2019s what Limbaugh said on his March 6 show:\n\"Hey, Ms. Gregoire, never mind that Barack Obama made NASA into a Muslim outreach department and it's Barack Obama, your idol and hero, that makes it necessary to pay the Russians $70 million for every astronaut to the space station,\" Limbaugh said.\n\"By the way, with this thing in the Ukraine, with the KGB vs. Obama, i.e., ACORN, what happens if Putin says, \u2018You know what, you really ticked me off and I'm not taking you back to your space station.\u2019 How we gonna get there, Ms. Gregoire? 'Cause Obama's shut it down. NASA's a museum for Muslim outreach now.\"\nThere\u2019s obviously some hyperbole in Limbaugh\u2019s comments here. But we did think it worthy to attempt to answer two questions:\n\n\nWhat is Limbaugh talking about when he says Obama turned NASA \"into a Muslim outreach department?\"\n\n\nDid Obama shut down NASA space flights?\n\n\nThe Muslim museum connection\nLimbaugh did not return a request for comment. But we\u2019re fairly certain the origin of his \"Muslim outreach\" claim stems from the summer 2010 news cycle. New NASA chief Charles Bolden made a curious remark about Obama\u2019s three-pronged vision for Bolden\u2019s job description in an interview with Middle Eastern news channel Al Jazeera.\nObama had made improving relations with the Middle East a priority in his first campaign and traveled to Egypt for an historic address to the Muslim world in July 2009. To commemorate the one-year anniversary of that speech, Bolden told Al Jazeera the following in Cairo (video):\n\"When I became the NASA administrator, (President Obama) charged me with three things. One, he wanted me to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math; he wanted me to expand our international relationships; and third, and perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math and engineering.\"\nMonths earlier, Bolden brought up NASA\u2019s goal of working with \"non-traditional\" allies, such as Indonesia, in a talk with engineering students, according to the Orlando Sentinel.\nWe wanted to know what other ground Bolden covered during the Al Jazeera interview, but we could not find a full-length transcript and video. So we turned to other recaps. A 2010 PolitiFact Texas fact-check on this topic pointed out Bolden also spoke of NASA\u2019s focus on international exploration of deep space and using robots to knock human race-threatening asteroids away from Earth. An ABC News synopsis said Bolden said his mission was not about diplomacy but expanding international relationships for \"tangible reasons,\" such as traveling to Mars.\nStill, Bolden\u2019s comment about reaching out to Muslim nations struck conservative talking heads and politicians as bizarre. Fox News commentator Charles Krauthammer said Bolden\u2019s remarks signaled \"a new height of fatuousness.\" Former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin, who served during the George W. Bush administration, called it a \"perversion\" of NASA\u2019s purpose. Limbaugh was mad back then, too.\nThe White House clarified Bolden\u2019s remarks as outrage swelled, with spokesman Robert Gibbs saying, \"That was not his task, and that's not the task of NASA.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA NASA spokesman told PolitiFact Texas in a previous fact-check, \"NASA\u2019s core mission remains one of space exploration, science and aeronautics. Administrator Bolden regrets that a statement he made during a recent interview mischaracterized that core mission. The success of NASA\u2019s efforts is increasingly enhanced by mutual cooperation with dozens of other countries around the world that are also committed to these efforts.\"\nIn the years since, Bolden has traveled around the world promoting NASA but has not made many public statements.\n\"He misspoke a bit and has since then had a fairly tight leash put on him by the White House,\" said John Logsdon, space historian at the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, in an interview with PunditFact.\nObama did not want Bolden to extend NASA\u2019s cooperation to solely Muslim countries, Logsdon said, but also to non-traditional countries in South America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The American space program could be\u00a0\"an instrument of political goodwill\" and help developing countries get involved with modern space activities, Logsdon said.\nWe reached out to NASA for examples of collaboration with Middle Eastern countries since Bolden took over, and about Limbaugh\u2019s characterization of Bolden\u2019s remarks in general, but a spokesman did not answer those questions.\nThe end of NASA\u2019s space shuttle program\nThe retirement of the 30-year-old space shuttle program may have happened under Obama\u2019s watch, but the process was triggered during the administration of President George W. Bush.\nIn 2004, Bush called for retiring the space shuttle once the International Space Station was complete. (PolitiFact looked at the origins of the phase-out of the American space shuttle program in this fact-check.)\nNASA retired its space shuttle fleet after the final flight for the space shuttle Atlantis in July 2011.\nThe goal after that was to have a commercial spaceship to carry American astronauts by 2015. In the interim, NASA is paying for seats aboard Russia\u2019s Soyuz space capsules for missions to the International Space Station. Other countries, like Japan and Canada, have reached the space station via Soyuz capsules, too.\nThat arrangement will continue for NASA through 2017. Part of the reason for the delay is that Congress has underfunded Obama\u2019s recent budget requests to help private companies develop their own space technology, according to Space.com, a space and astronomy news website.\nRegardless, one thing is clear: NASA is not closed for business. The agency has a $17 billion budget and is spending it, Logsdon said. There are satellites en route to Pluto and Jupiter, a rover on the surface of Mars, and work being done on the successor to the Hubble space telescope, he said.\nNASA spokesman David Weaver said the agency is working on a plan to launch American astronauts to the space station and not rely on Russian transport, but Congress needs to fund Obama\u2019s budget requests.\nOur ruling\nLimbaugh reached into the early flare-ups of the Obama presidency for his quip about NASA\u2019s conversion into a \"Muslim outreach department.\"\nThe notion stems from remarks by Bolden in an interview with an Arabic TV channel in 2010. Bolden identified three priorities from Obama, including finding \"a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math and engineering.\"\nThe Obama White House refuted Bolden\u2019s remarks once outrage swelled, with spokespeople emphasizing the agency\u2019s mission is space exploration and not diplomacy.\nLimbaugh also accused Obama of shutting down NASA space flights. Obama certainly played a role (the shuttle flights stopped while he was in office), but the plan to scuttle the space shuttle program started before Obama took office, and Congress has not fully funded budget requests to speed along the creation of a private American space fleet.\nThose omissions go beyond the realm of hyperbole.
