When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much.

If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2018\n\n\nTrump ignores basic facts about reality for Puerto Ricans after Hurricanes Irma and Maria after September 2017. Trump also miscasts the estimate as a Democratic effort when it was created by experts on disaster response.\nThere was no \"magic\" to the increase in the death toll estimates. It is based in science.\n\"Early after a disaster, death tolls tend to be preliminary,\" said Roberto Rivera, College of Business University of Puerto Rico. \"In the case of Hurricane Maria, indirect deaths are the reason the toll was so high, as suggested by some reports. That's the context that Trump is missing.\"\nDeath toll estimates by academics\nThe government in Puerto Rico initially reported 16 deaths in September 2017, and raised it to 34 in October and then 64 in December.\nBut for months, researchers had said that the government\u2019s official count was an undercount.\nPart of a death toll is a count of direct deaths from a storm, such as being struck by a falling tree or drowning in a flood. The more complicated count comes from indirect deaths caused by unsafe or unhealthy conditions, such as someone who relies on a respirator but loses electricity.\nUsually, the death toll of an event such as Hurricane Maria is determined through an exam by a medical examiner. But Puerto Rico officials did not have the proper resources to effectively conduct forensic examinations.\nWithout complete medical records, researchers were left with other ways to try to come up with an estimate. Multiple studies used different methodologies and time periods, and therefore arrived at different results about \"excess deaths\" \u2014\u00a0comparing the number of deaths with historical trends during the time period in previous years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcess death measurement has been a standard in the measurement of deaths attributable to environmental and climate events since the early 1960s, said Alexis Santos-Lozada, an assistant teaching professor at Pennsylvania State University.\nHowever, in some ways the case in Puerto Rico is unique. Before Hurricane Maria, governors and stakeholders were usually the first ones to raise alarm about the number of deaths \u2014\u00a0as the mayor of New Orleans did after Hurricane Katrina.\n\"This was not the case of Puerto Rico, in Puerto Rico we turned to estimates because both the governor and the president minimized the number,\"\u00a0Santos-Lozada said.\nOrigins of the 3,000 estimate\nTrump was referring to an estimate published in late August by George Washington University\u2019s Milken Institute. That estimate was higher than some earlier estimates by academics and the New York Times that were around 1,000, but lower than the 4,645 midpoint of a Harvard study.\nGov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 contacted\u00a0George Washington University in December, which led to commissioning the university to do a study.\nThe Milken Institute published the first phase Aug. 28 and found a midpoint of 2,975 excess deaths in the six months following the hurricane.\nThat number was 22 percent higher than the number of deaths that would have been expected during that period in a year without the storm. Researchers found that lack of communication and training for doctors about how to certify deaths resulted in an undercount.\nTrump misrepresents what the Milken Institute study actually concluded about deaths. The study did not include anyone who died for \"any reason, like old age,\" as he said. If that were the case, the number of deaths would have been much higher. The study found that there were 16,608 total deaths during the six months \u2014\u00a0and approximately 77 percent were at least 65 years old.\nThe study didn\u2019t attribute individual deaths to Maria; it tried to determine a number of \"excess\" deaths. In other words, it tried to find\u00a0how many deaths would have been expected were it not for the\u00a0but rather came up with a counterfactual: how many deaths would you expect to see each month if the hurricane hadn\u2019t happened and then subtract the actual number to arrive at an \"excess\" number of deaths.\nDr. John \"Jack\" Sandberg, an associate professor in the department of global health, told PolitiFact that the contract stipulated that the study would be done with no government interference by officials in Puerto Rico \u2014\u00a0and none occurred.\n\"I did the number crunching on this, no one ever said boo to me about anything,\" he said. \"We are quite shocked that this is having political repercussions.\"\nLynn Goldman, the dean of the Milken Institute, responded to Trump's tweets in a Washington Post op-ed.\n\"To set the record straight, our study was carried out with no interference whatsoever from any political party or institution,\" she wrote of the study done in collaboration with scientists at the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health. \"We do not know the exact circumstances around each of the 2,975\u2009excess deaths that occurred. Many factors \u2014 disruption in transportation, access to food, water, medications, power and other essentials \u2014 may have contributed.\"\nThe government in Puerto Rico accepted the Milken institute study and raised Maria's official death toll from 64 to 2,975.\nThe study's next phase\u00a0is expected to more closely examine the identified deaths to look at causes through interviews with family members and medical personnel.\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted that 3,000 people did not die in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico and that the\u00a0death toll estimate was \"done by Democrats.\"\nTrump tried to cast doubt on an estimate by George Washington University that includes indirect deaths. Studies by other academics or researchers have also concluded that the number of deaths was above 1,000.\nThe death toll provided by the government in Puerto Rico did rise after the storm from 16 to 64 in the months following the storm. The government then hired George Washington University to research an estimate and several months later it produced a report estimate 2,975 deaths. None of that is evidence of an estimate created by a Democratic conspiracy to make Trump look bad.\nWe rate this statement False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8cc83597-0b0f-44b9-b1d4-08f347457af7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01602"}
