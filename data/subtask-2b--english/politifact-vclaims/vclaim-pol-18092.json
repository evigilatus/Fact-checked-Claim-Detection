Chris Larson issued a news release responding to the \"first coronavirus case in Milwaukee County.\"\nJust one problem.\nThe county has no confirmed cases.\nAn employee at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Foundation was tested for the disease Monday, March 9, 2020, after falling ill following contact with a person who traveled to a country with a Level 3 warning. The school released that information a day later, noting test results were expected at the end of the week.\nBut Larson, D-Milwaukee, skipped the waiting-for-results part.\u00a0\nHe sent out a release March 11, 2020, announcing, \"The coronavirus has officially reached Milwaukee County.\" Larson is running for county executive, a role in which he would oversee \u2014 among many other things \u2014 many people and agencies with key roles combatting the virus.\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported officials with the Milwaukee County Jail, House of Correction, the county Behavior Health Division facility, the airport, and the zoo are among those on a weekly conference call discussing the local coronavirus response.\nWhile health officials around the country have said the virus is a great concern, they have also warned about overreaction and misinformation\nLive coronavirus updates: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel blog\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the wording of the news release, Larson campaign manager Sonja Chojnacki said it was a reference to \"the possible case that\u2019s being reported on.\" She said she was not aware of any positive tests.\nLarson\u2019s campaign sent out an amended news release referencing the \"potential coronavirus case at UWM\" after being questioned by the Journal Sentinel.\u00a0\nA positive test is hardly a foregone conclusion. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services is no longer releasing data on the number of people tested, but it reported only two of the first 46 tests came back positive.\nAt the time Larson\u2019s original news release went out, Wisconsin had three confirmed coronavirus cases. Two of those \u2014 in Dane County and Pierce County \u2014 were reported in the days before Larson\u2019s release. The state notes one of those has already recovered.\nOur ruling\nLarson, a state senator running for Milwaukee County executive, sent out a news release calling for action because coronavirus had \"officially reached Milwaukee County.\"\nBut that\u2019s sloppy at best.\nTo this point, no coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the county. Larson\u2019s staff confirmed they were referencing a UWM Foundation employee who at that point had only been tested.\nThe number of tests and cases are growing, so the situation in Milwaukee County will certainly change. But we rate statements based on what is known at the time they were made.\nAnd we rate Larson\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18092"}
