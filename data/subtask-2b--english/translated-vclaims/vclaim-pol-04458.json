Remember, Clinton compares its proposed expenditure with actual expenditure since the Second World War. No one can say at this stage how much Congress would approve if she were elected president. With that in mind, let's dig in Nettie-Gritty. Clinton has proposed total federal spending in several areas: $275 billion on infrastructure, $500 billion on higher education, $100 billion in energy and research and $25 billion on housing, as well as lower-cost investments in a few other areas. So this is at least a total of $900 billion in new spending over a 10-year period (or two extra periods after leaving office). How does that compare with the past? According to the Clinton campaign, the largest federal investment in three categories of jobs - infrastructure, education, research and development - since the Second World War has been about $766 billion over a 10-year period beginning in 1998, when her husband, Bill Clinton, was President. How the Clinton Policy Group reached this figure becomes a little weird. In short, its campaign collected historical data dating back to 1947 to estimate how much the federal Government spends on public investment each year - including on non-defence infrastructure, education, and research and development. For each year, they then calculate the amount of increase or decrease in investments over the next 10 years compared to that first year. (All figures have been adjusted for inflation.) Here one tastes what this means: the Clinton campaign estimated that total \"public investment\" in 1998 was $174 billion. Over the next 10 years, the increase in public investment totalled $766 billion. This is much less than the $900 billion (or more) proposed by Clinton in the form of an increase in investments over the next 10 years. It is a rough estimate, which does not necessarily accommodate all aspects of public investment, let alone how expenditure leads to new jobs. However, the experts told us that this is a reasonable representation of the size of Clinton's proposals compared to historical increases in spending in these areas. However, they added that we should view the volume of investment as a share of GDP, thus helping to increase spending as a share of the size of the economy at that time. We did the math. Thanks, Axl. We found that Clinton &apos; s statement was not quite accurate once it took into account GDP. Clinton &apos; s investment will be greater than most years, at about 5 per cent of current GDP. However, the share was higher each year than 1954-64 (6 to 12 per cent) and in 1998 at 6 per cent. On January 17, 2021, President Donald Trump stated in an interview with Fox News that he \"cannot say anything (about the riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms removed it.\" By Bill McCarthy on January 18, 2021, Clinton's proposals continue to account for a large amount of spending, much of which she intends to finance through changes in tax law. Jesse Rothstein, Director of the Institute for Research on Work and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, said that her spending proposal \"was historically large.\" For comparison purposes, Rothstein noted that the total federal expenditure on job training was less than $5 billion per year and that the budget of the Ministry of Education as a whole was less than $100 billion. For a more historical comparison, consider the largest investment in infrastructure since the Second World War, the interstate highway system, which began in the 1950s under President Dwight Eisenhower. The project has cost about $500 billion today over decades of construction, according to industrial analysts. Clinton + historical spending = jobs? Clinton's argument gives rise to a classic economic debate: does government spending create jobs, or are jobs lost as a result of increased spending and borrowing? Federal investment is not necessarily equal to \"new jobs with good pay,\" although, as Steve Ellis said, the vice-payers of public sense, a group that is concerned about the rising deficit, can be found. But if spending is not properly allocated, it can go to waste or stand in the way of the private sector. It is clear that parts of Clinton's platform are geared towards creating new jobs, such as investing $275 billion in infrastructure, which would involve construction jobs, and parts of a $10 billion package for the manufacturing sector that the campaign says will \"equalize\" manufacturers to create new and paid local jobs. Other proposals are more precise or require some assumptions, such as the idea that investment in energy research and development would lead to increased productivity, as well as increased private investment and ultimately increased employment. According to the Clinton Campaign, its plans to train colleges and the workforce will lead to the availability of higher-skilled workers for higher-skilled jobs. However, much of this money will go towards debt reduction for many students. This may help some children to get through the university without harming them, but their jobs will be the same for many that their debts will be lower. \"It's obvious, not every dollar of that will go straight to pay for a new job,\" said Rothstein. \"But I think it is reasonable, for example, to calculate student debt relief as an investment in well-paid jobs, since a graduate who gets a good job in another way but needs to pay a lot of her salary in loan payments does not actually have a well-paid job.\" Our referee, Clinton, says that her campaign includes \"the biggest investment in new jobs with good pay since World War II.\" Using approximate estimates of public investment in several sectors, Clinton's proposals - at least $900 billion over 10 years - appear to be larger than any other investment of 10 years since the Second World War. It should be noted, however, that when we look at historical public investment as a share of GDP, there have been 12 years since the Second World War with larger public investment. As to whether these investments will lead to \"new jobs with good pay,\" this is all a matter of prediction. In many cases, the new expenditure proposed by Clinton on education, research and development and infrastructure will not literally create new jobs. Instead, a large part of the money will go to programmes that the Clinton campaign argues will stimulate job creation. Its claim is partially accurate but requires additional information. We appreciate Clinton's claim of half the integrity. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/33b01e65-a13b-4a49-ab8a-80c2d1801b6a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04458"}
