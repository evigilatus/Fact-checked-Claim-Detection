We\u2019re not touching that here. Instead, we turn to another ownership claim by Brady.\n\nIn last week\u2019s televised mayoral debate, she was introduced as board chair and co-owner of Celilo Group Media. The company publishes and distributes coupon books, including the popular Chinook Book.\n\nCompany president Nik Blosser said that he doesn\u2019t use the co-owner term. But he confirmed that Brady is the third largest individual who is a shareholder in the company. He and co-founder Tom Koehler invited Brady to join their board nearly a decade ago, and she has been chairwoman since.\n\n\"So she has and has had a key leadership role in the company, and she's an investor herself,\" Blosser said.\n\nWho are we to argue with that? Brady\u2019s claim is accurate. We rule the statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11159"}
