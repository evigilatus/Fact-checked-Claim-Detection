CNN got a taste of this law of social media on Wednesday after airing a silly-looking graphic about a serious topic: the Islamic State\u2019s recruitment of female fighters.\nThe anchor\u2019s set-up of the segment did little to help viewers take it seriously.\n\"ISIS is talking online about jars of Nutella, pictures of kittens and emojis,\" CNN Newsroom host Carol Costello said in the Feb. 18, 2015, segment. \"These three images are in part helping ISIS recruiters lure westerners into their fight because they want people to believe their life on the battlefield isn't so different than yours. They actually eat Nutella, and I guess they have pet kittens.\"\nAs she spoke, a highly sharable graphic depicting a jar of the chocolate hazelnut spread, two orange tabby kittens\u00a0and a silly face from the emoji keyboard appeared with script (a chyron in TV talk) that said \"ISIS LURES WOMEN WITH KITTENS, NUTELLA\".\nCostello went on to interview Nimmi Gowrinathan, an academic who studies women in crisis and a visiting professor at the Colin Powell Center for Civic and Global Leadership at City College, New York. The words \"Nutella,\" \"kittens\" or \"emoji\" were not part of their discussion.\nInstead Gowrinathan talked about how the discussion of female Islamic State fighters (also called ISIS or ISIL)\u00a0should focus on the larger political suppression that pushes women to join these kind of movements rather than looking at what may have triggered one woman\u2019s turning point to extremism.\nBut her more nuanced discussion wasn\u2019t the takeaway. Instead the blogosphere ranks of Jezebel, New York Magazine\u2019s Daily Intel, and, most angrily, Vox dinged CNN for suggesting women could be easily \"lured\" into ISIS with guilty, silly pleasures.\nAs fact-checkers, we felt beckoned to sort out the confusion. Was CNN\u2019s segment just plain weird or onto something?\nCNN did not return emails and calls for comment. We went to experts who track jihadist groups, including ISIS, on social media.\n\"The way that the CNN story was framed was kind of funny and eyeroll-inducing,\" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, \"but it\u2019s largely correct.\"\nThe online prowess of the Islamic State is a well-documented strength of the movement. From videos to online forums to journals to various social media websites, supporters disseminate propaganda messages (90,000 a day) that are more slickly produced and reach wider audiences than efforts from other terrorist groups (think of al-Qaida home videos showing Osama bin Laden speaking into the camera with little other detail).\nISIS even has plans for a 24-hour propaganda network, said Daniel Cohen, a research fellow and coordinator of the cyber security program at Tel Aviv University\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies.\nThe videos or posts are often translated into multiple languages so that demographic groups can be more effectively targeted around the world. Some of the imagery depicts a fulfilling life in a dream state ruled by sharia law, where kids are cheerful and ISIS recruits offer humanitarian aid in war zones.\nAnd yes, the group\u2019s supporters also speak in emojis, tweet pictures of themselves unwinding with Nutella and run Twitter accounts like @ISILCats showing jihadists cuddling with kittens and kittens cuddling with firearms. It\u2019s all part of an effort to speak the same cultural language as potential recruits so that they don\u2019t think life with the Islamic State is all beheadings and burnings, Cohen said.\n\"Most of the people sharing this content on social media came from Western culture,\" Cohen said.\nIt makes them seem relatable and charismatic, said Gartenstein-Ross, adding that it\u2019s nothing new for ISIS.\nRichard Brennan, a Middle East expert at the RAND Institute, said the ISIS campaign \"is much more sophisticated\" than what was portrayed on CNN.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s targeting the young men and women who want to be part of something greater than themselves to accept this movement for the validity that they believe the Koran is teaching,\" he said.\nObviously, not all of the tweets, videos and images are cheery (the beheadings of prisoners, for instance). Other viral memes are designed to show how \"disgusting\" their enemies are by showing dead children\u2019s bodies from bombs or airstrikes.\nThe point is, the use of familiar western imagery in social media messages is just one tool in the Islamic State\u2019s vast marketing toolbox, and the real motivations for someone joining the fight run much deeper.\nThose motivations are connected to the pursuit of identity and purpose.\nSome of the women recruited by ISIS act as internal police within their territories to make sure people are adhering to sharia law and stopping women who are not dressed appropriately, Cohen said. They also play a big role in online recruitment efforts.\nIn an August article for Foreign Affairs, Gowrinathan criticized experts for being so perplexed by the formation of all-women brigades within ISIS. Women in war zones, she wrote, typically don\u2019t have a role in the politics of their society and are drawn to extremism when they cannot air their grievances in the open. Still, some are coerced into joining and do so for their own safety.\nThe audience for the communications with kittens and Nutella is a slim component of the majority of Sunni Islamic women who are joining ISIS from countries around the region out of oppression in their home state, she said in an interview with PunditFact.\nAnd even for the westerners, a life promising time with cute kitties and tasty sweets \"won\u2019t ever be enough of an effective recruitment tool for any group.\"\n\"The kittens and emoticon thing is most damaging because it denies women any political agency,\" she said. \"It infantilizes them in a way that you would assume they would be drawn to this for the most superficial reasons.\"\nFor the record, Gowrinathan said she wasn\u2019t brought on CNN to talk nutella and cats, nor was she pleased with the attention CNN producers brought to the popular hazelnut spread, winky faces and baby cats.\n\"All I tried to point out is we dismiss women\u2019s politics all the time,\" Gowrinathan said.\nCostello eventually deleted a tweet (which we captured below) promoting the segment with a video of the interview.\n\nAnd Gowrinathan tweeted that she did not, for the record, believe \"emoticons are relevant in recruitment of #women to #isis.\"\nOur ruling\nThis fact-check is a case study of what can go wrong when a news channel sacrifices nuance for an eye-catching graphic.\nOn CNN, that graphic said, \"ISIS LURES WOMEN WITH KITTENS, NUTELLA.\" There wasn\u2019t much more to Costello\u2019s introduction of the segment, but she did reference images of nutella, kittens and emojis that are used \"in part\" to recruit westerners.\u00a0Costello\u2019s words are technically accurate, but CNN\u2019s click-baity graphic is incomplete and misleading.\nIn reality, ISIS is using a vast array of tactics to persuade people to give up their lives for their fight. No expert would say that someone would join ISIS for the reasons isolated on CNN.\u00a0To boil down ISIS\u2019 recruitment strategy of women to nutella, emojis and kittens is a vast oversimplification that borders on the absurd.\nThere is a shred of truth to this claim but not much beyond that.
