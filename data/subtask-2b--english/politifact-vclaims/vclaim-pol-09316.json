The Atlanta Braves thrilled the city with an improbable World Series appearance. \"The Silence of the Lambs\" won the Oscar for Best Picture. Basketball legend Michael Jordan won his first pro championship.\n\n\nAnd Fulton County commissioners raised the millage rate, causing property taxes -- and anger -- to rise in Georgia\u2019s highest-populated county.\n\n\nNow, Fulton officials are upset with state lawmakers, who passed a series of bills this year that the lawmakers believe will improve county operations. County Chairman John Eaves made the argument that Fulton is a well-run county in a recent television interview.\n\n\n\"The facts are Fulton County has not increased its millage rate since 1991,\" Eaves told Channel 2 Action News\u2019 Lori Geary. \"So why fix something that\u2019s not broken?\"\n\n\nPolitiFact Georgia was curious whether Eaves was indeed correct about his claim that county commissioners haven\u2019t raised the millage rate in more than two decades.\n\n\nFor several years, Republican state lawmakers from north Fulton have battled with the Democratic-led County Commission over the direction of the county government. Many of the lawmakers and their constituents say they\u2019re not getting their money\u2019s worth in services for the taxes they pay. There\u2019s been talk, and unsuccessful legislation at the state level, to split Fulton into two counties. Fulton has 920,583 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. census.\n\n\nThe tax for general county services in Fulton is currently 10.281 mills, which equates to about $720 on a $250,000 home with a homestead exemption. But total property taxes in Fulton vary, depending on what part of the county the property is located. Cities add their own millage rates, increasing the overall rate. Then, there are other charges for bond payments, the county\u2019s school system and other services. Fulton\u2019s school board sets its own property tax rate.\n\n\nIn 1991, county commissioners voted 4-3 to raise property taxes. Then Chairman Michael Lomax said the increase was necessary to help fund Grady Memorial Hospital. Some residents unsuccessfully tried to recall Lomax. Eaves was first elected as chairman in 2006.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 1991, the county government\u2019s millage and bond rate has gradually declined. In 2011, though, it rose from 10.28 mills to 10.55 mills to help fund a library construction program. Fulton voters passed the proposed $275 million library program in 2008. Fulton public affairs manager Jessica Corbitt told us the increase of 0.27 mills was to the bond millage rate, not the general fund millage rate. It was listed on Fulton tax bills as a separate millage rate.\n\n\nThe county chairman\u2019s comments, though, do not reflect some property tax changes in a portion of Fulton.\n\n\nThe county has a Special Services District for a portion of its south Fulton residents. The Georgia Legislature created the district in 2006 after the cities of Chattahoochee Hills, Johns Creek, Milton and Sandy Springs were all created. South Fulton leaders pushed for the district to ensure funding for services in that portion of the county as those cities, most of them in the north, were being created.\n\n\nThe millage rate for the South Fulton Special Services District was 5.73 mills in 2006, county financial records show. It declined slightly to 5.66 mills in 2007 and 2008. The rate rose sharply in 2009 to 8.16 mills, the records show. It went up in 2011 to 8.97 mills and again in 2012 to 10.47 mills.\n\n\nThe county said in its 2012 budget book that the most recent increase was primarily due to lower assessments on property values and that the county needed the additional money to maintain the same level of service to residents there. The increases are a direct result of the defections of Johns Creek, Milton and Sandy Springs, as well as plummeting property values brought on by the Great Recession, county officials have said.\n\n\nCorbitt confirmed the accuracy of the financial records. She defended Eaves\u2019 statement in the television interview.\n\n\n\"While it is true that the millage rate has increased for the special services district, which serves approximately 10 percent of the county\u2019s population, the discussions related to the Fulton County legislation have primarily focused on the Countywide General Fund. With regard to the General Fund, the Chairman\u2019s statement is completely accurate,\" Corbitt said via email.\n\n\nTo sum up, Eaves said the county has not increased its millage rate since 1991. But the millage rate in the South Fulton Special Services Fund, which affects about 90,000 people, has increased several times in recent years.\n\nCorbitt said the south Fulton millage rate increases are not relevant to the ongoing debate. Still, Eaves would have been more precise if he had specified the difference. We rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09316"}
