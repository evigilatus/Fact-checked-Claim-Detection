Hinojosa told KERA, the Dallas public radio station: \"The party platform of the Republican Party says deport everybody and to hell with it. And that\u2019s just not what America\u2019s all about. So that\u2019s going to be a big contrast, and I think it\u2019s going to affect substantially the attitude a lot of Hispanics have toward Republicans.\"\nIt\u2019s been widely reported that Texas Republicans, who met in Fort Worth in early June 2014, removed platform language from 2012 endorsing a federal guest-worker program. Also, as the Austin American-Statesman noted in a June 7, 2014, news story, the platform was stripped of \"any provision that would create an opportunity for immigrants living and working in the United States without legal sanction to receive provisional visas.\"\nDid the party also say \"deport everybody,\" as Hinojosa said?\nThe word \"deport\" isn\u2019t in the 2014 Republican platform, which has a two-page section on immigration that opens by saluting the importance of immigrants in the nation\u2019s history.\nIt goes on to say: \"It remains imperative to create fair and consistent procedures that will enable freedom-loving, hard-working and law-abiding immigrants to join us, by providing them an efficient, practical method of legal entry, so they can lawfully take positions where their labor is needed, without exploitation or harassment.\n\"Our national interests are poorly served by our broken, embattled, and outdated immigration system, and patchwork attempts to mend its deficiencies will not prepare us to continue to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex global economy that demands the legal movement of people to fill jobs at all skill levels.\"\nAmong other elements, the immigration plank calls for more officers on the border, an end to the possibility of in-state college tuition for certain illegal residents and protection of the ability of law officers to ask into the immigration status of someone in custody.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe closest the plank comes to deportation is a line stating no form of amnesty should be granted, \"including the granting of legal status to persons in the country illegally.\" Such individuals, we suppose, would remain subject to deportation at any time.\nFor a slightly longer perspective, we looked next at the state Republican Party platform adopted by delegates to its June 2012 convention. The 2012 immigration plank opens: \"Because of decades-long failure of the federal government to secure our borders and address the immigration issue, there are now upwards of 11 million undocumented individuals in the United States today, each of whom entered and remain here under different circumstances.\n\"Mass deportation of these individuals would neither be equitable nor practical,\" the 2012 platform says, going on to oppose \"blanket amnesty\" while endorsing a temporary guest-worker program \"to bring skilled and unskilled workers into the United States for temporary periods of time when no U.S. workers are currently available.\"\nTo our email request for the basis of Hinojosa\u2019s claim, Emmanuel Garcia, spokesman for the state Democratic Party, said Hinojosa was \"referring to the emotions that many Latinos and immigrants feel with the rhetoric at the\" 2014 \"GOP convention and the changes in the GOP platform. You are correct those exact words are not there.\"\nOur ruling\nHinojosa said the Republican Party platform \"says deport everybody and to hell with it.\"\nThe heck you say. The Texas GOP platform opposes illegal immigration and any legal status for unauthorized U.S. residents, which leaves deportations a possibility. But the platform doesn\u2019t venture as far as the chairman said. It doesn't call for deporting everybody living here illegally.\nWe rate this claim as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07665"}
