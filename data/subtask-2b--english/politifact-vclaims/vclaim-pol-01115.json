Two days before his address to the nation, though, a Facebook post about the president\u2019s remarks about immigration started to gain traction.\n\"Trump said illegal immigration has been a problem in America for 'thousands of years,' \" the Jan. 6, 2018 post says. \"Is it possible to be any more ignorant?\"\nBy Jan. 18, it had been shared nearly 15,000 times, and it was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The White House also did not respond to an email about the Facebook post.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the claim appeared on Facebook the same day Trump took questions from the media on the South Lawn at the White House about the government shutdown. According to a transcript of his remarks, Trump said: \"I put out a quote this morning of Barack Obama; I put out a quote this morning of Hillary Clinton in 2015 \u2014 that was a few years ago \u2014 strongly saying that you need a border to keep illegals out. And that\u2019s what you have to have. But it\u2019s not just illegals. It\u2019s criminals. It\u2019s drugs. It\u2019s the new phenomena that\u2019s been age-old, been going on for thousands of years, but it\u2019s never been worse than now because of the Internet. Human trafficking \u2014 where they grab women, put tape over their mouth, come through our border, and sell them. And they go both ways, in both directions.\"\nNearly a week later, on Jan. 11, Trump spoke again at the U.S. border patrol station in McAllen, Texas. According to a transcript of those remarks, Trump hit a similar note: \"In a few moments, the American people will hear directly from or frontline border agents about the tremendous flood of illegal immigration, drug trafficking, human trafficking \u2014 a phenomena that has been going on for a thousand years or more, and that you\u2019d think was something that modern society wouldn\u2019t have. And I hate to tell you that, because of the Internet, it\u2019s worse than ever before. Human trafficking \u2014 it\u2019s a horrible thing.\"\nThough Trump did say \"thousands of years\"\u2014or, later, \"a thousand years or more\"\u2014while talking about border security, it was to lend historical context to the broader problem of human trafficking. While Trump's stream-of-consciousness manner of speaking does sometimes leave room for interpretation, actual transcripts show he did not suggest the United States itself is thousands of years old, or that illegal immigration has been a problem here for that long.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01115"}
