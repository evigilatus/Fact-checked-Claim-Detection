(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIn reality, schools in Canada\u2019s provinces have not yet been shut down through the year\u2019s end. The Facebook post also mischaracterized the employment insurance measures that Canada implemented to provide income support for Canadians who miss work due to the coronavirus.\nSchools are closed, but not necessarily for the year\nCanada\u2019s 10 provinces and three territories have mandated school closures \"with varying dates, which in some cases coincide with the term break,\" according to UNESCO.\u00a0\nAs of March 25, here\u2019s what each of Canada\u2019s provinces has decided for its schools:\n\n\nAlberta: Schools are closed \"until further notice.\"\n\n\nBritish Columbia: Schools are closed indefinitely.\n\n\nManitoba: Schools are closed until at least April 10.\n\n\nNew Brunswick: Schools are closed until at least March 30.\n\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador: Schools are closed indefinitely.\n\n\nNova Scotia: Schools are closed until at least April 6.\n\n\nOntario: Schools are closed until at least April 6.\n\n\nPrince Edward Island: Schools are closed until at least April 6.\n\n\nQuebec: Schools are closed until at least May 1.\n\n\nSaskatchewan: Schools are closed indefinitely.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn sum, the Facebook post overstated the extent of Canada\u2019s school closures, although the situation could change. All 10 provinces have shut down schools for some length of time, but as of March 25, no province had ordered schools closed for the rest of the school year.\nEconomic support measures\nThe Facebook post also mischaracterized Canada\u2019s economic response to the coronavirus.\nOn March 18, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced several actions, some of which were replaced in the final legislation, that the government would take to temper the economic burden faced by Canadians.\nCanadians should not have to worry about paying their rent or mortgage or buying groceries because of the #COVID19 crisis.

Because at a time like this, you should be focused on what matters most - your health and the health of those you love. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re announcing the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit today. \u2935\ufe0f\u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) March 25, 2020 \nThe $2,000 per month is roughly the same as $950 every two weeks. But again, it will only apply to workers who lose income due to the coronavirus. It won\u2019t apply to \"each family.\"\nA government webpage detailing Canada\u2019s efforts to support individuals outlines the emergency response benefit, the six-month moratorium placed on student loans and the flexibility provided to borrowers who need to defer up to six monthly mortgage payments.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said: \"All schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notif(ied) to suspend mortgage payments for at least six months, and student loans deferred.\"\nThe post is right about mortgage payments and student loans. But it overstates the impact of Canada\u2019s new employment insurance benefits and exaggerates the extent of school closures.\nWe rate this statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18208"}
