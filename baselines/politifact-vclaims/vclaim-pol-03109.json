Trump attended a fundraising lunch at the Four Seasons in New York before spending the rest of the day at Trump Tower.\nHe also engaged in a Twitter feud that day with Clinton.\nThat morning he took to Twitter and called Clinton \"Crooked Hillary,\" saying his Democratic rival would be a \"disaster\" on everything from the economy to the military to health care.\nThe barbs continued throughout the day, with Trump lashing out at President Barack Obama over his endorsement of Clinton.\n\"Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama \u2014 but nobody else does!\" Trump tweeted.\nClinton replied that afternoon, urging Trump: \"Delete your account.\"\nTrump then fired back: \"How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up \u2014 and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?\"\nAccording to a schedule of Trump\u2019s rallies released by NBC, Trump held no rally on June 9, and he did not appear for a Florida rally until June 11 \u2014 two days after Trump\u00a0Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner met at Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer.\nThe date of Trump\u2019s Florida rally is backed up by a Tampa Bay Times photo taken at the Tampa Convention Center in downtown Tampa on Saturday, June 11, 2016.\n\nOur ruling\nLewandowski said \"Donald Trump was doing a rally in the state of Florida\" the day his son and others met with a Russian lawyer in New York.\nThat\u2019s wrong.
