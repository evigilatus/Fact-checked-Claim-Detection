The site of August 15 was shared more than 7,000 times: \"The number of people killed in mass shootings in 2018 = 194 and the number killed by illegal immigrants in 2018 = 83,211.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is a very specific function and is not provided with inaccurate sources for several reasons. First, there is no universally accepted definition of collective fire. The Armed Violence Archives, a non-profit research group tracking shooting incidents in the United States, defines mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, with the exception of the shooter, are shot and/or killed in the same location, at approximately the same time. On the basis of this definition, the organization reported that 372 people had been killed by 338 mass shootings in the country in 2018. This is almost double what the claim states. If you go through the mass shooting project by crowds, which goes through the definition of mass shooting more loose for four or more people, shooting in one incident, including the shooter, the number in 2018 rises to 528 from 426. Or take the findings of Mother Jones, which use the name of the most conservative large-scale shooting by the government: one attack in a public place where three or more of the victims are killed. This definition significantly reduces numbers and eliminates all shootings in which victims are only injured. According to the stricter classification, Mother Jones reported there were 12 mass shootings in the United States in 2018 that killed 80 people. Regardless of how you look at it, the first half of the position is suspended - either very high, or very low. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 January 16, 2012, what about the part where 83,211 people were allegedly killed by undocumented immigrants in 2018? This is also inaccurate. Firstly, there is no national database to track the number of persons killed by illegal immigrants in the country. However, even without these data, it is clear that this figure is beyond what can be considered a reasonable estimate. In 2017, the estimated total number of homicides in the United States was 17,284, a decrease of 0.7 per cent compared with the 2016 estimates, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Consolidated Crime Reporting Programme. According to the Agency &apos; s initial report of 2018, there appears to be an overall decrease in violent crime in the country: \"Preliminary figures indicate that law enforcement agencies across the country showed an overall decrease of 4.3 per cent in the number of violent crimes brought to their attention in the first six months of 2018 compared with the figures reported at the same time in 2017.\" The final report on crime statistics for 2018 has not yet been issued, and this function is unlikely to be based on anything reliable. But even without those figures available, we know that the United States suffers from some 17,000 homicides each year, including those committed by legal citizens. It is therefore impossible for migrants alone to be responsible for the killing of more than 83,000 people in 2018. Furthermore, according to the Kato Institute, which describes itself as a \"policy research organization - an intellectual institution - dedicated to the principles of individual freedom, limited government, free markets and peace,\" the rate of criminal imprisonment of immigrants is lower than that of original Americans: \"All immigrants have a lower criminal incarceration rate, and there are lower crime rates in the neighbourhoods in which they live, according to the near-collective findings of peer-reviewed evidence. Since 1911, large federal migration committees throughout the country have asked whether migrants are more vulnerable to crime than Americans born in the country, and each of them responded with rejection, even when the rest of their reports blamed migrants unduly for almost every problem in the United States. From the Migration Commission in 1911, also known as the Dillingham Commission, to the Wickersham Commission in 1931, and the Barbara Jordan Commission in 1994, both reported that migrants were less likely to commit crimes than home-born Americans. The organization also looked at Texas, the only country to track crimes committed because of immigration status, in a study conducted in 2018, and found that \"the conviction and criminal arrest rates of immigrants in 2015 were significantly lower than those of Americans born in the country of origin. Moreover, the conviction and arrest rates of illegal immigrants are lower than those of Americans born in the country. This result bears most of the crimes.\" Our Facebook viral publication claims that 194 people were killed in mass shootings in 2018, while undocumented migrants killed 83,211 people. This function appears to be completely fabricated - no part of the claim has been verified. Estimates of deaths due to large-scale shooting in 2018 range from 80 to 528, depending on the reporting organization and how each defines \"large-scale shooting.\" However, there are no estimates close to 194. Also, according to the FBI, approximately 17,000 murders occur in the United States every year, so 83,211 people killed by undocumented immigrants in a single year is unlikely.
