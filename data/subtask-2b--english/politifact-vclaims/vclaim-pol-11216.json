Hmm.\"\n\n\"The University of Florida announced this past week that it was dropping its computer science department,\" the blog post said. \"Meanwhile, the athletic budget for the current year is $97.7 million, an increase of more than $2 million from last year. The increase alone would offset the savings supposedly gained by cutting computer science.\"\n\nThe article, written by Forbes contributor Steven Salzberg, a professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Medicine, quickly gained traction on social networking sites, getting posted, re-posted and commented on hundreds of times.\u00a0Salzberg said even he was surprised at the attention it got.\n\nBut is the claim true? Is UF really cutting computer science to save the same amount of money that it's adding to athletics? Couldn\u2019t the university use the extra sports money to fund the academic program?\n\nIt's true that UF is struggling with budget cuts while athletic funding is up. But the blog post details are questionable. The computer science program isn't going away, for example. And it's not quite so easy for the university to move money from athletics to academics.\n\nSalzberg told us\u00a0he got his information from various news articles and the UF athletic budget, which he found by searching online. Budget documents for the UF Athletic Association show that\u00a0total expenditures for 2011-2012 were $97.7 million, about $2 million more than the year before.\n\nMeanwhile, UF is attempting to save $1.4 million by overhauling one of its engineering departments.\u00a0But the department, Computer & Information Science and Engineering, isn\u2019t being eliminated. Instead,\u00a0UF is considering merging it with another department, Electrical and Computer Engineering.\u00a0No one's major would change, and course offerings would remain the same.\u00a0\n\nBut many of the program\u2019s teaching assistant positions would be eliminated, with faculty taking on a greater teaching role in the consolidation, the university says.\u00a0The idea sparked campus protests when it was made public a couple weeks ago.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s part of a total $4 million cut that the engineering college has to deal with, its share of a $36.4 million cut to the university \u2014 which is UF\u2019s share of a $300 million cut to higher education statewide.\n\nCammy Abernathy, dean of UF\u2019s engineering college, said she understands people\u2019s frustrations. Nobody likes budget cuts, she told PolitiFact Florida. \"It\u2019s painful.\"\n\nStill, she believes the reorganization would make the best of the situation. \"We looked for areas where we had duplication or overlap,\" Abernathy said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed in a statement released by UF, in response to the Forbes article:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Dean of the College of Engineering has put on the table for discussion a budget plan to reorganize the Computer & Information Science and Engineering Department. Under that proposal, all undergraduate and graduate degree curriculum would remain the same and the college would maintain its brainpower and research capacity. The plan calls for no lay-offs of tenure-track faculty.\"\n\nBut what about that athletic budget? Surely UF could use that extra couple million out of the athletic association\u2019s total $97 million to bolster engineering, right?\n\nNot exactly, says UF.\n\nThe athletic association is a separate, nonprofit entity from the university and does not receive direct state funds. Its money comes from ticket sales, donations, Southeastern Conference revenues and student fees of about $2 per credit hour.\n\nUF President Bernie Machen has no authority over the association\u2019s budget, said university spokeswoman Janine Sikes. \"It is a separate organization with a separate board,\" she said.\n\nIf the association wants to contribute to UF, that\u2019s up to them. And it regularly does so, giving the university more than $60 million since 1991 for academics. Last year, it gave $6 million, paying for things like scholarships, campus events and updates to facilities.\n\nThe association can\u2019t give academics an unlimited amount, Sikes said. Not only does the program require money to operate, but many boosters are specific about wanting to donate to UF sports.\n\nAfter many commenters on the Forbes article made the same points, Salzberg added a clarification. But he maintains that the athletic association director reports to the university president, and as such, Machen should be able to direct those athletic funds however he wants.\u00a0\n\n\"He\u2019s out of his mind to allow this to happen,\" Salzberg responded to a commenter.\u00a0\n\nAnd if Machen isn\u2019t doing anything about it, perhaps Gov. Rick Scott should, Salzberg said. After all, Salzberg points out, Scott just approved the creation of the state\u2019s 12th university, Florida Polytechnic, which will be built in Lakeland under the flag of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\n\"Heads up, Gov. Scott: no one is going to believe that you\u2019re supporting technical education when your flagship university is eliminating its Computer Science Department,\" Salzberg wrote.\n\nScott\u2019s office wasn\u2019t crazy about that suggestion, also issuing a response to the Forbes piece.\n\n\"It would be nice if Gov. Scott could make spending decisions for the universities, but that\u2019s not the way our system is set up,\" said Lane Wright, a governor\u2019s office spokesman. \"In the meantime all he can do is what he has been doing, which is urging them to focus on programs that will give graduates hope of actually getting a job.\"\n\nSalzberg told Politifact Florida that the intent of his piece was to illustrate what he sees as hypocrisy by Scott and other state leaders \u2014 cutting the budget of a well-established engineering program while committing to a new university that\u2019s likely to require more, not less, state resources in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s a compelling overall idea, but some of the finer points are a bit stretched. The university is considering consolidating programs, not eliminating computer science entirely. And the funds for academics and athletics aren\u2019t easily moved around.
