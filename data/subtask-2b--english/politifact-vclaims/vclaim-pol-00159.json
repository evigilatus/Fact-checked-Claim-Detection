(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe real story originated in August 2017, according to the Chicago Tribune, when a teen around 15 years old was warned that if he continued to sneak onto the basketball court of the XSport Fitness facility in Skokie, Ill., just north of Chicago, the police would be called. The gym\u2019s staff eventually alerted the Skokie Police Department after the boy attempted to get in again.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValenti responded, and when he found out the teen had a membership that expired after his mother couldn\u2019t afford it anymore, \"he offered to pay $150 out of his own pocket, asking fitness center workers how much membership time that would buy for the boy,\" the Tribune reported.\u00a0\nIt covered up to about four months, but after the gym\u2019s corporate office found out about the situation, they said the $150 would go toward a two-year membership, instead, with the gym picking up the rest of the cost.\nThe false Facebook post includes Valenti\u2019s full name and photo and appears to be the same photo published by the Tribune. In the post\u2019s caption, it\u2019s obvious the original text was erased and the part that says he \"shot him 53 times\" was inserted, as the text size and style doesn\u2019t visually match up with the rest of the sentence.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00159"}
