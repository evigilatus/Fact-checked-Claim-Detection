Charlie Christ, Scott's been drinking Christ over and over for the jobs he lost during his tenure. Scott said that 238,000 jobs were lost during Christ's term. Christ - who served from January 2007 to January 2011 as a Republican but now functioning as a democracy - responded to his rule during a global economic meltdown. \"One of the decisions I made to get us through this was to work with the President so that we had the money available to keep teachers at work. Now, Rick Scott said taking recovery was an absolute mistake, which would have led to the class of 20,000 teachers.\" Christ used the term shooting, which isn't exactly accurate, since it could have been a layoff. In any case, we do not see this as a serious matter, because the context illustrates the kind of job loss he's talking about. Is it true that taking the federal stimulus Krest saved 20,000 teachers from being laid off? The catalytic money provided jobs that Christ made a similar statement when he announced that he would be running for Governor in St. Petersburg in November. It is one of many retrogressive and immediate attacks about funding education and separating teachers between candidates. The Christ Statement refers to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009, the federal stimulus bill of President Barack Obama, which was adopted by Congress in 2009 at $787 billion. The Florida Ministry of Education published information in 2010 on the number of \"educational personnel\" affected by the Recovery Act. The Department identified 19,166 full-time equivalent posts, which affected a total of 31,003 staff in the quarter ending 30 June 2010. Educational staff included classroom teachers and other school staff, including guidance advisers, librarians and audio-visual workers. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job. On January 15, 2021, the then State Commissioner for Education, Eric Smith, said that stimulus dollars had saved up 26,000 teacher jobs. (Smith was appointed by Christ.) The incentive funds were paid over two years: in 2009-2010, about $908 million went to K-12 education and another $873 million the following year, according to Ruth Milton, Director of Government Relations of the Florida School Councils Association. Milton Polyte Fact Florida said when we first considered this allegation in 2013. But it is difficult to determine the exact number of teachers who would have been discharged without pumping federal money, because we cannot expect each province to deal with its own budgets. Some districts with health reserves may have avoided or minimized demobilization. Or maybe they'd find other ways to cut teachers' budgets. \"It could actually have meant more teachers than the report said,\" said Milton. On the other hand, some provinces could have released more expensive teachers who were close to retirement, and could have reduced that number. The governor, Christ, said that if Florida hadn't taken the incentive, it would have led to the expulsion of 20,000 teachers. The Ministry of Education has identified 19,166 full-time equivalent jobs affected by incentive funds. This is close to what Christ said, but this figure includes not only teachers, but also other types of school workers. In addition, it is difficult to determine the exact number of teachers who could have been demobilized across the state, because the provinces had discretion in how to deal with budget cuts, and perhaps had other options to cut spending until after the teachers were laid off. The statement is accurate but needs to be clarified, so we often appreciate it.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07162"}
