Connie Mack, R-Fort Myers, opposes the federal stimulus.\n\nHe\u2019s decried President Barack Obama\u2019s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which poured $787 billion into the economy, a \"waste of money\" and a move \"to ignore the will of the American people.\"\n\nHe\u2019s released media statements and ads accusing Obama and Sen. Bill Nelson, whom he wants to unseat from the U.S. Senate, of pushing a stimulus that wasted \"millions in taxpayer dollars\" on things like cocaine-addicted monkeys. (PolitiFact pegged that ad as Mostly False.)\n\n\"I\u2019ve said time and time again, we cannot spend our way to prosperity,\" Mack said in a 2010 media release about the stimulus.\n\nThat\u2019s why, on the night of the Oct. 17 Senate debate, Nelson was prepared to use Mack\u2019s own political weight against him.\n\n\"(Mack) rails against the stimulus bill, he didn\u2019t tell you he wrote a letter to the Department of Transportation in order to get $29 million in stimulus for his congressional district,\" Nelson said.\n\nMack, perhaps prepared for the comment, absorbed Nelson\u2019s punch unruffled. But he also didn\u2019t refute it.\n\nThat\u2019s why we decided to fact-check for ourselves.\n\nWe started by asking Nelson\u2019s campaign for evidence.\n\nNelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin gave us a copy of a letter Mack wrote to Secretary Ray LaHood at the U.S. Transportation Department asking for the money on behalf of Charlotte County.\n\nMack\u2019s letter, dated September of 2009, asked the federal government for $29 million to build the Southwest Florida Intermodal and Logistics Center, a project to introduce high-speed rail transportation to Southwest Florida.\n\nTo read the letter, you\u2019d think Mack not only approves of the stimulus, but believes it\u2019s a potential boon to Southwest Florida\u2019s economy.\n\n\"This project will establish a connection between Southwest Florida economic centers and the seaports of Tampa and Manatee counties, advancing the region\u2019s economic competitiveness,\" Mack wrote.\n\nThe letter continued: \"This project is shovel-ready and will facilitate the transportation of goods and people throughout Southwest Florida, spurring economic development in a region crucial to the economic health of the state. These aspects make Charlotte County\u2019s project an excellent candidate for funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was designed in part to encourage economic growth through investments and infrastructure.\"\n\nThe Transportation Department denied the grant, and the project never got off the ground, said Charlotte County administrator Jason Stotzfus.\n\nBut Mack also sent at least two other letters to help the county apply for different stimulus grants.\n\n\"Chances are better if we have the support of our legislators,\" Stotzfus said.\n\nPietro Nivola, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Mack\u2019s approach to the stimulus is common.\n\n\"Constituent services is all about responding to appeals and requests,\" Nivola said. \" If people in (Mack\u2019s) neighborhood were thinking here's some money, here's an opportunity...it's incumbent upon him to follow up.\"\n\nIn fact, Vice President Joe Biden used a similar gotcha against Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., during the Oct. 11 vice presidential debate. Ryan, looking flustered, replied that all representatives ask for stimulus money for their constituents.\n\nMack political consultant Gary Maloney had a similar analysis, and he offered this analogy.\n\nIn 2001 and again in 2003, Nelson voted against tax cuts. But when Floridians wrote him for help on tax issues, Nelson didn\u2019t tell those constituents to take a hike because he opposed those bills, Maloney said.\n\n\"In 2009, Mack voted against the stimulus on principle. Nelson voted with Obama, and the Democrat majority prevailed,\" Maloney said. \"Once the stimulus bill was the law of the land, Mack still represented his constituents. And when Charlotte County applied for funds, Connie naturally helped the taxpayers of his district.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nDuring the U.S. Senate debate, Nelson accused Mack of denouncing the stimulus but asking for money.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret: Mack frequently bashes the stimulus as an impediment to economic growth.\n\nYet, his letters suggest he thinks the stimulus money would boost his area\u2019s economy.\n\nWe rate Nelson\u2019s claim True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist\n\n\nstated on November 4, 2009 in an interview on CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I didn't endorse\" the federal stimulus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 November 5, 2009", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10029"}
