Reduced taxes. More freedom. This is the slogan of the Liberal Party of Georgia, which this year offers candidates for a handful of State posts, including the Governor. In the province of Cherokee, the lawyer and Libertary Jeff Amason are running as a candidate for District Council 21. This seat is currently occupied by Scott Turner, a Republican from Holly Springs. Amason recently appeared on WSB Radio &apos; s Monica Perez presentation to discuss his candidacy and priorities, including curbing government spending. \"The State budget has increased by some $800 million per year in each of the past two years. You can only imagine what it might be in five years, \"Amson said. \"We need to finance core programmes. We don't need to fund every program there.\" With the slow but steady recovery of the economy, we have decided to verify the claims for the Amazon budget. We contacted him, and he sent us the budget figures for the fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014, as well as for the current fiscal year, which began on July 1. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, these data showed that the total State budget increased from $18.5 billion in 2012 to $19.3 billion in fiscal year 2013 and $20.2 billion in 2014. That was an $800 million jump between 2012 and 2013 and an increase of $900 million between 2013 and 2014. We confirmed the accuracy of the Amazon figures using the budget documents available on the website of the Governor &apos; s Office of Planning and Budget. (We did not compare the 2014 and 2015 budgets because the General Assembly will amend the 2015 expenditure plan at the legislative session beginning in January). Among the factors contributing to the payment of recent State budgets was the increase in the number of enrolments in public schools, the medical care programme and the health insurance programme for children in the State, as well as the costs of pensions, according to State documents. Current expenditure levels exceed 2005 levels by 26.7 per cent and have not been adjusted for inflation, as indicated in the report of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts. In summary, Amazon said that the State budget had increased by some $800 million per year in each of the past two years. He was very close, if not conservative in his assessment, we appreciate his words correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07271"}
