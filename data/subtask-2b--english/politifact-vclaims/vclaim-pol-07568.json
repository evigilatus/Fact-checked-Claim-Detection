The poll was conducted online. Unlike scientifically designed surveys, those who responded were not chosen at random but rather volunteered to participate.\nWe checked the survey, which asked doctors, hypothetically, whether they would prescribe marijuana to help alleviate the suffering of a 68-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer.\nThe study\u2019s authors, both physicians, wrote they were surprised by the outcome -- 76 percent said yes. Although participation in the survey was global, 1,063 of the 1,446 votes came from the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\"Analysis of voting across all regions of North America showed that 76 percent of voters supported medicinal marijuana,\" the study\u2019s authors wrote. The low end of support came from Utah, where only 1 vote in 76 supported medical pot. Pennsylvania represented the other extreme, with 102 of 107 votes in support.\nThe study\u2019s authors took a fairly specific situation -- the plight of a suffering 68-year-old -- and extrapolated the votes to indicate that 76 percent of physicians generally support medicinal marijuana. That\u2019s a bit of a broad brush. However, the authors, Drs. Jonathan N. Adler and James A. Colbert, also noted that many votes came with explanations that went beyond that one hypothetical.\n\"Many pointed out the known dangers of prescription narcotics, supported patient choice, or described personal experience with patients who benefited from the use of marijuana,\" they wrote. Those who opposed medical marijuana, by contrast, \"targeted the lack of evidence, the lack of provenance, inconsistency of dosage, and concern about side effects, including psychosis.\"\nInvited by the authors to write a rebuttal, Drs. Robert L. DuPont and Gary M. Reisfield noted that marijuana can cause lung damage, further harming anyone who already has breathing problems.\nWe checked for additional national surveys assessing physicians\u2019 views toward medical marijuana.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most prominent effort was published April 2, 2014, on WebMD\u2019s website. Of 1,544 doctors surveyed, 69 percent said marijuana can help with certain treatments and conditions; 67 percent said it should be a medical option for patients; and 56 percent supported making it legal nationwide.\nThe survey, drawn from doctors representing more than 12 specialty areas, reported a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent. However, as with the New England Journal of Medicine survey, this effort was voluntary, self-selected and unscientific.\nThe survey and poll come as 23 states, including Oregon, and the District of Columbia have now legalized medical marijuana, with eight of those states signing on in just the past three years.\nWe contacted the Oregon Medical Association to see where Beaver State physicians stand on the issue.\n\"We don\u2019t recommend participation in medical marijuana,\" Gwen Dayton, the organization\u2019s general counsel and vice president for health policy, wrote in an email. \"If a physician wants to, fine, but if they ask us whether they should or not, we don\u2019t recommend it.\"\nAsked about the national survey, Dayton said, \"They are an esteemed publication. I\u2019d never say anything they print is nonsense.\"\nThe American Medical Association takes much the same view. While the association is calling for more research into marijuana\u2019s effectiveness as a medical option, it has no language that would give doctors a green light to prescribe it, Kelly Jakubek, the AMA\u2019s public information officer, wrote in an email.\nWe called Liz Kaufman, New Approach Oregon\u2019s campaign director. She said the journal of medicine\u2019s article was posted on New Approach\u2019s Facebook page not because the statistic is viewed as a scientific finding, but because it brings attention to the issue.\n\"This was a study published in the journal, not conducted by it,\" Kaufman said. \"Nor was it a telephone survey. It came from a self-selected set of doctors who gave opinions as individuals. We weren\u2019t making a statement about the New England Journal of Medicine. This is just an article we\u2019re bringing attention to.\"\nNew Approach Oregon\u2019s stated reason on Facebook was to highlight that its measure wouldn\u2019t change anything regarding medical marijuana. \"Our campaign knows that doctors know what\u2019s right for their patients,\" the post reads. \"That\u2019s why the New Approach initiative makes no changes to Oregon\u2019s medical marijuana program.\"\nThe ruling:\nNew Approach Oregon, a group backing an initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the state, claimed on its Facebook page that \"76 percent of doctors approve of medical marijuana use.\"\nThe figure comes from an unscientific survey published in one of the country\u2019s most reputable health publications. Participants chose to take part and were not drawn from a random sample.\nNew Approach Oregon offered no nuance with its posting, including the fact that the study was not scientific, nor that it was based on a single hypothetical example.\nThe associations representing most physicians in both Oregon and the U.S. are making no such call, at least for now, that marijuana should be a treatment option for doctors.\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.\nThoughts on our ruling? Click on over to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on our ruling.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07568"}
