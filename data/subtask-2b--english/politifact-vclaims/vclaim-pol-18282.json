Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2020 \nBy tradition, former presidents extend some graciousness to their successors. But there is no hard and fast rule. And as you\u2019ll see, former presidents have, when it suited them, criticized the person who followed them into the White House.\n\nHoover\u2019s warnings against the New Deal\nThe first example that leaped to mind of three presidential historians we contacted is President Herbert Hoover, who lost to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932.\n\"He railed against the New Deal, FDR, liberalism and, in some ways, modernity itself, from the time he left office in 1933 until his death in the mid-1960s,\" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.\nAt the 1936 Republican convention, Hoover cast Roosevelt and the New Deal as a step toward dictatorship.\u00a0\n\"The New Deal may be a revolutionary design to replace the American system with despotism,\" Hoover said. \"Their product is the poisoning of Americanism.\"\nA generation later, Harry Truman seized the moment at the Democrats\u2019 convention in 1956 to attack his Republican successor, Dwight Eisenhower, Claremont McKenna College\u2019s John Pitney noted.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For three and half years, the Eisenhower administration has been using every trick and device to pry our water power, and our forest, our parks and oil reserves out of the hands of people and into the pockets of a few selfish corporations,\" Truman said Aug. 17, 1956.\nFord, Carter and Reagan\nJump forward to 1977, when Republican Gerald Ford ridiculed the economic policies of the man who ousted him from office, Jimmy Carter.\n\"Mr. Carter's anti-inflation program came in like a lion,\" Ford said three months into Carter\u2019s presidency. \"It's going out like a mouse.\"\nCarter carried on the tradition. In November 1982, he said President Ronald Reagan had undermined confidence in America\u2019s global leadership.\n\"There's not that assured feeling now that our country is in the forefront of peace, nuclear arms control, human rights and environmental concern that it was before,\" Carter said in a news conference.\nAt the same event, Carter chastised Reagan for faulting Carter for the problems Reagan faced.\n\"There is always the temptation for an incumbent politician to blame all his mistakes on his predecessor,\" Carter said. \"Most are willing to withstand the temptation. Mr. Reagan, apparently, is not.\"\nThe idea that Obama is the first president to criticize his successor has been around since at least 2018, when Snopes found it false, citing Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton as recent examples.\n\"Trump\u2019s claim is simply not true under any possible definition of \u2018speak against\u2019 or \u2018successor,\u2019\" said Rutgers University historian David Greenberg.\nOur ruling\nA Twitter post, retweeted by Trump, claimed that Obama \"is the first ex-president to ever speak against his successor.\"\u00a0\nThere are several examples of former presidents criticizing the person who followed them into office. For much of the past century, Republicans have spoken ill of Democrats, and Democrats have done the same with Republicans.\nWhile the tradition of exercising restraint exists, it has its limits, and in at least one case, an ex-president spoke out as early as three months into the new administration.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18282"}
