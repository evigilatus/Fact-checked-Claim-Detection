Is He Right?", "text": "Gov. Gavin Newsom dedicated his second State of the State address almost entirely to California\u2019s deepening homelessness crisis. He said the problem today requires \"a coordinated crisis-level response,\" one that gets \"the mentally ill out of tents and into treatment\" and produces affordable housing to ensure no Californian is homeless.\u00a0\nBut Newsom also said the crisis \"has persisted for decades\" and made a claim that suggests it was worse 15 years ago.\u00a0\n\"Back in 2005, when we did that first point-in-time count, there were over 188,000 thousand people that were deemed homeless in the state of California. \u2026 That\u2019s 35,000 more than we have today,\" Newsom said during his address, held at the state Capitol.\nThose figures caught our attention.\u00a0\nHas the state\u2019s homeless population really dropped by 35,000 over the past decade and a half? We set out on a fact check.\u00a0\n\u2018Apples To Oranges\u2019 Comparison?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development tracks homeless figures for each state based on point-in-time counts conducted every two years by local agencies. For 2005, HUD listed California\u2019s homeless population at 188,299, matching Newsom\u2019s figure.\u00a0\nLast month, HUD released its 2019 report showing California had 151,278 homeless people, or about 37,000 fewer than in 2005. That also generally lines up with the governor\u2019s statement.\u00a0\nBut we found there\u2019s been a major change in how homeless people are counted since 2005. At that time, some communities, including Los Angeles County, would count the \"the hidden homeless,\" or those who were temporarily living in a motel or on someone\u2019s couch, in addition to those who lived on the streets, in cars, shelters or abandoned buildings.\u00a0\nHUD stopped allowing the practice of counting the hidden homeless several years ago.\u00a0\nThat makes comparing past data to today\u2019s \"apples to oranges,\" said Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Sacramento Regional Coalition to End Homelessness. \"It\u2019s not even close.\"\u00a0\nSharron Rapport, director of the California Policy Corporation for Supportive Housing, said a significant number of people who were counted as homeless residents in the past are no longer tallied.\u00a0\n\"There may not be an actual decrease of 35,000 people experiencing homeless. It could just be that we counted them differently before,\" said Rapport, who serves on the governor\u2019s homelessness task force.\u00a0\nAdvocates for homeless people have criticized HUD\u2019s methodology for not counting these less-visible individuals. They have said point-in-time counts, which are conducted on a single night at the end of January and largely by volunteers, tally only a fraction of the total homeless population.\n\"We know there\u2019s an epidemic, right? You would have to be blind to not understand the nature of the epidemic,\" Margaretta Lin, executive director of the Dellums Institute for Social Justice said in a CityLab news article in 2019. \"But HUD defines homelessness as people who are literally homeless. People who are in a motel for that night or couch surfing for that night, under the HUD definitions, they are not considered homeless.\"\nWhile the change in HUD\u2019s methodology partially explains the lower homeless population, Rapport said California is also doing a better job housing people without a permanent home than it did in the past.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos Angeles County, for example, is now housing 133 homeless people per day, a significant increase from the past, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a forum last week on homelessness. The mayor noted, however, that an estimated 150 people per day are becoming homeless in the county.\u00a0\nA More Visible Crisis\nSetting the numbers aside, Rapport said there are several reasons homelessness is more visible now compared with 15 years ago. For one, it\u2019s in more communities.\n\"It used to be more concentrated in specific areas. Now it is more dispersed,\" Rapport said. \"We see homelessness in every part of our state. \u2026 It\u2019s not just in our urban centers, it\u2019s in our suburban areas, it\u2019s in our rural areas. People notice it more, I think, because of that.\"\u00a0\nThe high-profile Hepatitis A outbreaks that spread in homeless communities in San Diego and Los Angeles, along with more media coverage of the topic have also raised awareness, she said.\u00a0\nWhen we asked about Newsom\u2019s statement, the governor\u2019s office told us it\u2019s \"not a perfect\" comparison. But, they said, the federal reports are the only comprehensive source available.\u00a0\nThey added that Newsom was not trying to suggest that the crisis has improved, just the opposite.\nOur Ruling\nNewsom claimed: \"Back in 2005, when we did that first point-in-time count, there were over 188,000 thousand people that were deemed homeless in the state of California. \u2026 That\u2019s 35,000 more than we have today.\"\nHis figures are technically right based on homelessness reports issued every two years by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\u00a0\nBut his statement ignores a key change in how the reports count homeless people. In the past, they tallied a large number of \"hidden homeless,\" those living temporarily at a friend\u2019s home or motel. Today, those people are no longer counted, meaning Newsom\u2019s comparison is problematic, at best.\u00a0\nWe rated the governor\u2019s claim Half True.\u00a0\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nRELATED:\u00a0\nTranscript And Analysis: California Gov.
