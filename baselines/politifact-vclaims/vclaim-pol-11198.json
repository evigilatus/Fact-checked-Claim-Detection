Scott Walker in April, added penalties if physicians perform medication-induced abortions without an in-person exam before the procedure -- a move aimed at blocking the potential use of so-called \"webcam abortions\" in Wisconsin. Medication-induced abortions are limited to the first nine weeks of pregnancy. \u00a0\n\nThe law also required that doctors tell patients they \"must return\" for a post-abortion follow-up appointment at the same facility within 12 to 18 days instead of, for example, seeing their primary care doctor where they live. Critics, such as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, say this places an undue burden on women, especially in rural areas.\n\nIndeed, in the wake of the law, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said April 20, 2012 it would stop providing medication-induced abortions, citing legal uncertainty for doctors.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage also drew a strong reaction from the Wisconsin Medical Society, which said the law intruded on the patient-doctor relationship.\n\nIn an April 19 interview with the Wisconsin State Journal, the society\u2019s new physician-president, Tosha Wetterneck of Madison, spoke about the mandate that women return to the same facility for follow-up care.\n\nThe story paraphrased Wetterneck\u2019s remark this way: \"If she refuses, or prefers to see her personal physician, the patient would face no penalty but the doctor could be charged, Wetterneck said.\"\n\nThe remark prompting a reproductive rights group, RH Reality Check, to say that doctors could face a Class I felony and up to 42 months in jail if the patient does not return for the recommended visit. Its Web posting cited Wetterneck\u2019s comment.\n\nMeanwhile, state Sen. Mary Lazich, R-New Berlin, author of the original bill, denounced critics\u2019 descriptions of it as \"grossly misstated,\" and the claim about criminal charges when patients no-show as \"patently false.\"\n\nSo, who\u2019s right?\n\nCan doctors be charged if a patient fails to do something?\n\nWhile debate rages on about the broad impact of the law -- critics say it limits access to the procedure, proponents say it protects women from substandard care -- we found wide agreement on this narrow question.\n\nThe consensus: Doctors could face a fine of up to $10,000 if they don\u2019t advise women to return in 12 to 18 days -- but not criminal liability.\n\nAnd the forfeiture only applies if the doctor fails to inform -- it\u2019s not dependent on what a patient does later.\n\nWe heard that from Lazich and Wisconsin Right to Life, but also the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council, a state government agency that analyzed the bill -- and even the Medical Society itself.\n\nThey all said that even though the bill says patients have to be told they \"must return,\" there is no accountability built into the law for either the woman or the physician if the woman does not come back.\n\nSo why was Wetterneck of the Medical Society quoted as saying doctors could be charged?\n\nMedical Society lobbyist Mark Grapentine told us Wetterneck is not a lawyer and likely thought \"charged\" was an appropriate description even for forfeitures. He said she and the Medical Society understood the lack of criminal penalties for the no-return scenario, while strongly objecting to felony liability for other aspects of drug abortion protocols.\n\nWe think the term \"charged\" would be heard by most listeners as a reference to criminal liability -- as evidenced by the reaction from RH Reality Check.\n\nPerhaps confusion on the issue was inevitable.\n\nThe law does create a criminal felony penalty for failing to follow certain procedures related to a medication-induced abortion. Just not the protocol on the post-abortion follow-up.\n\nSpecifically, Act 217 requires that the same doctor who prescribes the drugs do the pre-procedure exam and be physically present when the drug is given. Bill authors say those rules were aimed to block use of Web cameras to consult with women about the drugs, as is done in some states to make abortions more possible in rural areas. By law, at least 24 hours must pass between the patient\u2019s voluntary consent and an abortion.\n\nThe potential criminal penalty on that point, for the person who provides the drugs, is up to 42 months imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nThe president of the Medical Society said a new abortion law means doctors could be charged if patients don\u2019t return for a follow-up appointment after a drug-induced abortion.\n\nOn that specific portion of the law, no criminal liability was inserted, and doctors\u2019 duty is limited to orally informing the patient she must return.\n\nThere is a new criminal penalty for failing to personally supervise such abortions, but Wetterneck clearly was referring to the follow-up care section of the bill.\n\nWe rate her statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can comment on this item on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's web site)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11198"}
