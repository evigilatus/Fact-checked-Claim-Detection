Full stop. That's it. They don't have to worry about anything else.\"\n\nThe president\u2019s unequivocal language caught our eye. More than 20 provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to take effect. Are most folks \u2014 those who already have health insurance \u2014 in the clear?\n\nExperts told us the reality is somewhat more complex.\n\n\u2018A huge train wreck\u2019\n\nThe president had been asked to respond to a recent comment from Sen. Max Baucus, a Democratic architect of the law, that rollout might be a \"a huge train wreck.\"\n\nBaucus said at an April hearing that he was \"very concerned\" that not enough had been done to educate people about changes on the way.\n\nBig shifts include new state- and federal-run health insurance exchanges, rules about what policies on the exchanges must offer and a requirement that everyone have insurance.\n\nAnd those are just three of more than 20 provisions to take effect between now and 2018, according to a time line from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent nonprofit group that\u2019s closely followed the law.\n\nBut Obama told reporters at his news conference that any \"implementation issues\" wouldn\u2019t apply to the majority of Americans who already have health insurance. Instead, he clarified, they would affect only \"the small group of people \u2026 who don't have health insurance right now or are on the individual market and are paying exorbitant amounts for coverage that isn't that great.\"\n\nIn other words, he was already correcting himself. But did he go far enough?\n\nThe \u201885 to 90 percent\u2019\n\nThe president had offered blanket reassurance that \"the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance\" had nothing left to worry about.\n\nHe\u2019s right that about 85 percent of folks have some kind of health insurance, according to the most recent Census survey of health coverage. Nearly 16 percent said they didn\u2019t have any coverage in 2011.\n\nWhich means Obama was telling a fairly diverse group of people they had already experienced what the health care law had to offer them: Folks with health coverage through their employers (55 percent), through government programs such as Medicaid (17 percent) and Medicare (15 percent), through policies they buy themselves (10 percent) and through the military (4 percent).\n\n(Those numbers add up to more than 85 percent because the categories aren\u2019t exclusive \u2014 some people have more than one kind of coverage.)\n\n\u2018Stronger, better and more secure\u2019\n\nFor all of those people, Obama said, the \"only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better and more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it.\"\n\nThere certainly have been helpful impacts: protection for people with pre-existing conditions, elimination of lifetime limits, coverage of 26-year-olds on their parents\u2019 policies and no-fee preventive care.\n\nBut those haven\u2019t been the \"only\" impacts.\n\n\"I think there's quite a bit more,\" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who has been a critic of the law.\n\nSome people who have insurance now may face:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Higher taxes\n\n\u2022 More comprehensive, and thus more expensive, policies\n\n\u2022 Employers who opt out, self-insure or move toward part-time employees\n\n\u2022 Health care providers who no longer take Medicaid or Medicare\n\nBut those possibilities apply to small, specific groups of people \u2014 or it\u2019s not yet clear how widespread they may be.\n\nHigher taxes, for example, include new restrictions on tax-free health accounts, a higher threshold for deducting unreimbursed medical expenses and a higher Medicare Part A insurance tax for high-income families.\n\nThen there are higher taxes on pharmaceutical manufacturers, health insurers and employers \u2014 costs which may be passed on to consumers.\n\n\"People will feel those effects as well,\" said Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush.\n\nBut recent headlines about higher premiums \u2014 such as a request for a 25 percent hike by a Maryland insurer and a recent study showing underlying medical costs for individual policyholders may rise 32 percent \u2014 only apply to the individual market. That is, the less than 10 percent of people who buy their own insurance.\n\nCheaper policies with fewer benefits \u2014 perhaps more than half of what\u2019s offered on the individual market now \u2014 simply won\u2019t be available on new insurance exchanges. But some people will qualify for new subsidies to offset higher premiums on their better, more expensive policies.\n\nThen there are anecdotal worries about employers opting out, self-insuring or moving toward part-time employees.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to say how big the effect will be on currently insured workers, or which companies will follow through on their tests. Darden Restaurants, which infamously experimented with shifting more of its workers to part-time to avoid offering insurance, faced \"considerable backlash,\" according to NPR, and backed off.\n\nMeanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that unions are pushing for federal subsidies to keep offering plans jointly with employers to some 20 million people, warning that they may drop coverage.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that employers will drop coverage for about 8 million people in 2019 \u2014 less than 3 percent of Americans \u2014 while people insured through exchanges will leap by 27 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Medicare savings under the health care law include reductions in payments for hospitals and nursing homes, which Medicare\u2019s actuary has warned may make it hard for about 15 percent of them to stay profitable. Doctors have also had to fight off scheduled payment reductions, and some have limited their number of Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n\n\"Medicare is in as much trouble as it ever was,\" said Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management, business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\nIn other words, at least some people with insurance now do face Obamacare implementation worries, as their employers and insurers grapple with how to adjust to changes under the law.\n\nBut it\u2019s not most people, Pauly and a few other experts told us.\n\n\"I think the story isn't over yet, and there will be surprises and disruptions for some people, even if the overall impact is stronger, better and more secure,\" said Tim Jost, a health care expert at Washington and Lee University School of Law.\n\nEmployees who get insurance through large employers, in particular, face the least uncertainty.\n\n\"There isn't going to be a major financial impact on them,\" Jost said. \"And they'll have some benefit.\"\n\nBut Obama got into trouble by punctuating his point with phrases like the \"only impact,\" \"full stop\" and \"that\u2019s it.\"\n\nThat\u2019s just an exaggeration, Wilensky said.\n\n\"He really put an exclamation point on it, which, yeah, doesn't hold,\" Tanner said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama attempted to reassure Americans that for most of them, Obamacare \"has already happened.\" He went on: \"And their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better and more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it. They don't have to worry about anything else.\" He glossed over other impacts of the law, including higher taxes and in some cases, higher premiums. Meanwhile, some people who have insurance now will have to deal with changes from their employers, insurers and health care providers. Most people who have large-group coverage through their employers now face little change, experts told us. So for many of those people, Obama was largely correct.
