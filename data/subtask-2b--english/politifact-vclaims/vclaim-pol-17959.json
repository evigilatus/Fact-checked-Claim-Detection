Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York, urged a quicker reopening of the economy, in part because he said that a failure to do so would cause psychological harm and spur deaths from drug abuse.\nIn the op-ed, Kennedy said he has seen a \"roughly three-fold increase in the number of drug overdose deaths\" during the pandemic. As the country is struggling economically, he wrote, \"such measures come at a cost that goes well beyond the adverse impact they have had on our economy.\"\nThis argument drew a response from Monica P. Wallace, a Democratic assemblywoman for the 143rd District of New York. She told the Buffalo News that Kennedy glossed over the reality that significantly more people died due to the coronavirus in two months than died of overdoses all of last year.\nThe Buffalo News paraphrased Wallace\u2019s remark this way: \"Wallace said Kennedy failed to mention that significantly more people died of Covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before.\"\nWhen we reached her, Wallace confirmed that the paraphrase was accurate.\nWe found that her assertion is correct.\nHow many COVID-19 related deaths were there in two months?\nFor the number of coronavirus deaths, Wallace referred us to a count by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found from the beginning of April until the end of May, approximately 96,647 people died in the United States.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of deaths through mid-June was 103,339, according to the CDC. However, this may be an underestimate due to difficulties in collecting the full data.\nHow many people have died of drug overdoses last year and the previous year?\u00a0\nFor the number of overdoses, Wallace referred us to CDC data.\u00a0\nThe CDC\u2019s most recent full-year data is for 2018. That year, there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths. In 2017, there were 70,237 overdose deaths.\u00a0\nSo the national figures show that the two-month toll of coronavirus deaths exceeded the year-long number of drug overdose deaths in both 2017 and 2018.\nThe same was true for New York state. There were 21,964 coronavirus deaths in New York state between the start of April and the end of May, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That compares to 3,697 drug overdose deaths for all of 2018 in New York state and 3,921 in 2017.\nOur ruling\nWallace said that significantly more people died of Covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before.\nShe\u2019s correct. Nationally, more than 96,000 Americans died of the coronavirus in April and May 2020, compared to a bit more than 70,000 Americans who died of drug overdoses in the higher of the two most recent years, 2017.\nWe rate the statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17959"}
