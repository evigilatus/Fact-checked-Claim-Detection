So it's not surprising that Alan Fong, the mayor of the Republic of Cranston, was attacked for -- wait for that -- raising taxes. A new announcement entitled \"Alan Fung - Ainter's Interster\" by the American leadership PAC, the Political Action Committee focusing on the election of democracy Gina Raimundo, asks, \"What do we really know about Alan Fong?\" The announcement calls it a \"professional politician\" and says, \"As mayor, taxes are raised three times.\" Fong became mayor in 2009. He has repeatedly admitted that he raised taxes three times during his six years in office. But he also inherited a huge pension problem, a budget with $1.5 million in counterfeit savings, and a school committee that spent about $8 million that she didn't have. His first year of office was marked by a significant reduction in government assistance that shook cities and towns. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2012, with the great recession in a perfect vortex, it has not become easier for him or other mayors. For example, at the beginning of his term, the sharing of public revenues was abolished, with the State providing some $55 million in sales and income taxes to municipalities. But he and the city eventually stabilized the budget and during the last three years of his six states, the city did not raise taxes. In the end, the statement in the American commercial declaration of the pilot ship is accurate. But because it ignores the important context of the last three years in which taxes have not been raised, it is often assessed as valid.
