On Twitter on July 12, the American Republic warned Greg Stiop, from Sarasota, that Democrats had banned almost a decade ago the use of money to transfer detainees from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to the United States. \"This means that terrorists currently detained at Guant\u00e1namo Bay can be transported to a neighbourhood near you,\" Stube wrote. Steub is right that the ban has been abolished in the House of Representatives proposal. However, he was wrong to say that the 40 detainees currently in Cuba might come here. This is why: The House of Representatives Bill will only prohibit federal funds allocated to additional detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. \u2022 The House of Representatives Bill calls for federal officials to submit a \"desertification plan\" to Congress on detainees. But the plan to act is that plan. It is not necessary to implement them. \u2022 Because it is important, the White House states that it will recommend that Trump veto the House Bill if he arrives at his office. According to the Guantanamo Defence Bill, the House of Representatives voted 220-197 for approval of the National Defence Licensing Act 2020 in the amount of $733 billion. The draft law was unanimously rejected by the Republicans - eight Democrats joined - for a number of reasons, including the Guantanamo rule, which is $17 billion less than the Senate version. The House of Representatives Bill contains wording prohibiting \"the use of funds for the transfer and detention of additional individuals\" at Guant\u00e1namo Bay on May 2, 2018 or thereafter. The Senate formula extends the long-standing ban on the use of funds to transfer or release detainees in Gitmo to the United States. If the House of Representatives Bill becomes law as it is (the veto warning means it will not be), it will not apply to those currently detained there, as Charles \"Cole\" Stimson said, who coordinated the arrest policy of the Pentagon during President George W. Bush's administration. Stimson, a legal colleague at the Conservative Heritage Foundation, said: \"Don't say you have to get rid of those who are there.\" The bill also provides for the Attorney-General and the Minister of Defence to submit to Congress a plan on how to proceed with each individual detained at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. This does not necessarily mean that they will be sent to facilities in the United States. On January 13, 2021, Jake Taber made remarks on CNN Radio that Donald Trump's second presidential accusation was \"more isolated between the two parties in American history.\" Rachel Harris, Stype spokesman, said that Democrats had prevented efforts to include a ban on the use of money to transport detainees to the United States, a regular language in previous annual defence bills. Harris said that without a provision prohibiting the use of funds to transport detainees, they could be transferred at any time. These detainees may end up in the United States in any number of facilities throughout the country that are located in American societies throughout the country. Stimson didn't agree to that. He said: \"Only because the Council does not include this provision prohibiting the use of funds to bring detainees to the United States does not automatically mean that if it becomes law as approved, the executive branch will decide to bring detainees from Gitmo to the United States.\" \"There's a lot of green between the ball and the cup on this one.\" In 2016, Trump said we'd carry her with the bad guys. It did not achieve that goal, but the population remained essentially stagnating. But he kept his promise to keep Guantanamo Bay open. Even if the Government decided to empty Guant\u00e1namo Bay, that did not mean that detainees would land in United States detention facilities. Detainees may be sent to their country of origin, to another country or to the country where they have been arrested. \"I don't see any indication that anyone in the administration in knowledge has made a recommendation or paid to bring detainees to the United States,\" said Stimson. \"On the contrary, the question was whether the administration could bring additional detainees to Gitmo, including ISIS. They're not looking to unload the detainees in Gitmo, they're looking for loading.\" Our Governor, Steub, said, \"The terrorists currently detained at Guant\u00e1namo Bay can be transported to a neighbourhood near you\" as a result of the actions taken by the Democrats at home on the National Defence Licensing Act. Democrats have for almost a decade banned the use of funds to transport detainees from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to the United States. However, this does not mean that the current 40 detainees will be sent to facilities in the United States. A bill issued by the House of Representatives stated that federal funding could not be spent on additional detainees sent to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The House of Representatives Bill directs officials to write a plan on how to deal with detainees. However, this plan does not mean that detainees will also be sent to the United States. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00420"}
