It had been shared on Facebook more than 52,000 times.\nThere are a lot of parts to this claim, so we will take them one by one.\nRecent changes to North Dakota\u2019s voter ID laws\nSigned into law by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum in April 2017, HB 1369 requires a voter to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that includes their legal name, date of birth and current residential street address in North Dakota.\nThe bill stipulates that a driver\u2019s license, Department of Transportation-issued ID, or tribal government-issued ID are acceptable forms of identification, and allows for other documents, such as a utility bill or paycheck, to supplement missing or outdated information.\nNorth Dakota is the only state without voter registration, abolishing it in 1951, according to the Secretary of State\u2019s office.\nA group of eight Native Americans from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa had already been in a legal battle with the state over voting rights when Burgum enacted Republican-led HB 1369. So, in December 2017, the plaintiffs, represented by attorneys for the Native American Rights Fund,\u00a0amended their original January 2016 complaint, Brakebill vs. Jaeger, and asked a federal judge to declare the new law unconstitutional. They argued\u00a0it violates the national Voting Rights Act.\nThe plaintiffs argued that the law was discriminatory because, \"most tribal IDs do not have a residential address printed on them. This is due, in part, to the fact that the U.S. postal service does not provide residential delivery in these rural Indian communities. Thus, most tribal members use a PO Box.\"\nReached by email, Occupy Democrats told PolitiFact that the organization should have specified in their graphic that Native Americans \"in remote areas\" use PO boxes.\n\"But we stand by the general veracity of the statement, especially with regards to this specific example in North Dakota,\" Occupy Democrats wrote in the Oct. 18 email.\nIn April, Judge Daniel L. Hovland of the U.S. District Court of North Dakota blocked the bill\u2019s new requirements from being enforced. However, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision, allowing the street address requirement to be implemented in the upcoming midterm elections. In September, the Native American Rights Fund took the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to vacate the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling\nOccupy Democrats\u2019 graphic also said, \"The Republican-controlled Supreme Court just said it\u2019s totally okay for North Dakota to demand that ONLY residents with street addresses can vote.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Brakebill vs. Jaeger was 6-2, with justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissenting.\nNewly appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate in the decision. It is generally accepted by political scholars, however, that Kavanaugh\u2019s addition to the court means there is a conservative-majority tilt.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Supreme Court declining to intervene, North Dakota\u2019s voter ID law and its street address requirements will remain in place. However, the U.S. Supreme Court didn\u2019t make a legal determination on the basis of North Dakota\u2019s law. It simply decided not to intervene.\nWere Native Americans the last to get the right to vote?\nThe graphic also said, \"Native Americans were the last to get the right to vote, and now they are the first to lose it.\"\nThat\u2019s partially accurate, but the timeline of American\u00a0voting rights is far less cut-and-dried than that statement might suggest.\nOver the course of history, all but a very small segment of the people who live in the U.S. have had to fight for the right to vote. At the nation\u2019s founding in 1776, only property-owning Protestants over the age of 21 (most of whom were white and male) were given the right to vote.\nEveryone else had to see laws changed in order to cast a ballot.\nIn 1870, the passage of the 15th Amendment meant that, in theory, African-American men could vote. In 1920, the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote. In 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act gave Native Americans citizenship rights, including the right to vote. And in 1952, the McCarren-Walter Act eliminated laws that prevented Asians from becoming naturalized citizens, which included voting rights.\nIn each case, however, the law on the books didn\u2019t necessarily reflect what was happening when people showed up at their polling places to try to cast a ballot.\nIn reality, Native Americans were turned away from casting ballots in New Mexico and Arizona until 1948, when courts ruled in their favor against state government. In Utah, Native Americans weren\u2019t allowed to vote until 1957, becoming the last of America\u2019s indigenous people to be formally recognized as citizens.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the United States applied strong legal spackle to the question of voting rights, filling in the many holes and cracks that, for hundreds of years, permitted elections officials to discriminate against citizens who sought to cast a ballot on Election Day.\nThe new law was primarily championed by black Civil Rights leaders, but it ultimately\u00a0extended protections to people of all backgrounds by prohibiting poll taxes, literacy tests, election fraud and voter intimidation \u2014 tactics that had been used to thwart Native Americans from voting.\nDoes a PO Box really mean you can\u2019t vote?\nOccupy Democrats\u2019 graphic claimed that because of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Native Americans in North Dakota who only have PO boxes will be unable to vote.\nHowever, news reports show that tribal officials and a voting rights advocacy group called Four Directions are working with the Secretary of State\u2019s office to pave ways for those who have PO boxes to be able to go to their polling places with other documentation that will allow them to cast their ballots. These include efforts to help residents secure other acceptable forms of ID to present at the polls.\nThe Associated Press on Oct. 19 reported that \"tribal officials can issue a tribal voting letter with the eligible voter's name, date of birth and residential address at polling locations on reservations,\" a proposal that Deputy Secretary of State Jim Silrum said would be considered valid ID.\nIn her dissent, Justice Ginsburg noted that the numbers of North Dakota residents who are affected by this change is significant: \"1) 70,000 North Dakota residents -- about 20 percent of the turnout in a regular quadrennial election -- lack qualifying ID; and 2) approximately 18,000 residents lack supplemental documentation sufficient to permit them to vote without an ID.\"\nThat means that voting rights advocates have a huge job ahead of them to ensure those affected by the law are able to go to the polls with acceptable ID.\nOur ruling\nOccupy Democrats said that the U.S. Postal Service only gives tribal residents PO Boxes and that because the Supreme Court decided not to intervene in North Dakota\u2019s voter ID law, Native Americans will lose the right to vote.\nWhile rural tribal residents in North Dakota are issued PO Boxes for addresses, it is not true that all tribal residents only have PO Boxes. And a conservative-leaning court did rule to let stand a new North Dakota voter ID law that requires a voter to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that includes their legal name, date of birth and current residential street address \u2014 but the new ninth member did not participate.\nNorth Dakota\u2019s law does pose obstacles for many tribal citizens who don\u2019t have street addresses. However, through the work of voter rights advocates and officials with the Secretary of State\u2019s office, there are ways that Native American voters who have PO boxes instead of residential street addresses will be able to vote.\u00a0The law does not mean they are losing their right to vote altogether.\nThe group also said that Native Americans were the last U.S. citizens to be granted the right to vote and the first to lose them. Native Americans in Utah were the last ethnic group to be recognized by both state and federal law as citizens with voting rights. But it wasn\u2019t until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that federal law more thoroughly addressed issues of voter discrimination for all people, giving underrepresented voters of many ethnicities the actual right and means to vote.\nFor a mixed bag of accuracy, we rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01432"}
