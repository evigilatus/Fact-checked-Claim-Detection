Jon Richards made a claim that made us wonder how prosecutors in district attorney\u2019s offices across Wisconsin have been getting by.\nIn a video released June 16, 2014, the Milwaukee Democrat stated:\n\"Last year, I was involved with an effort to to help prosecutors get their first pay raise in more than 10 years.\"\nNo raises for more than a decade?\nNo.\nBut let us explain.\nThe background\nThe main job of the state's locally elected district attorneys and the assistants they hire is to prosecute felony and misdemeanor crimes, as well as well juvenile cases, in circuit court. Wisconsin has 72 counties but 71 district attorneys, as one DA serves both Menominee and Shawano counties.\nThe assistant district attorneys were county employees until 1990, when a change in state law made them state employees and allowed them to collectively bargain for wages.\nThe pay for the assistants has been a concern for years. A University of Wisconsin-Madison study in 2011 that called for raises found that dating back 2005, annual turnover among assistant district attorneys exceeded 18 percent.\nRichards\u2019 evidence\nWe asked Richards campaign spokesman Sachin Chheda for evidence to back the claim that Richards helped get prosecutors their first pay raise in more than 10 years. He suggested we contact David Feiss, a Milwaukee County assistant district attorney and president of the Association of State Prosecutors, the statewide union for assistant DAs.\nFeiss told us it would be wrong to say the state\u2019s prosecutors have not received any pay raises in more than a decade.\nIndeed, contracts that the union negotiated with the state provided a number of across-the-board raises, as the UW-Madison study noted:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear pay raise effective\n\n\nAmount of raise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 percent, plus 10 cents/hour, plus $250 lump sum\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\n\n2 percent\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n2 percent\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\nApril: 2.25 percent; July: 2 percent plus $1.25/hour\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n1 percent\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, how can Richards claim there were no raises?\nFeiss pointed out to us that the contract covering 2003-\u201905, unlike previous contracts, contained no provision for merit pay raises and that subsequent contracts have not, either.\nIn other words, assistant district attorneys couldn\u2019t advance in pay beyond the across-the-board raises.\nThat changed after the Legislature in 2012 created a new merit pay structure, which was implemented as part of the 2013-\u201915 state budget. As Richards noted, he helped lead that effort.\nThe new pay progression plan consists of 18 hourly salary steps, from $49,429 on the low end to $119,471 at the top. Each step is worth $4,120.\nEffective in July 2013, prosecutors were moved up in pay by one step. And going forward, based on merit, they can get a raise of one step or more each year, although the total annual raise cannot exceed 10 percent.\nOur rating\nRichards said that in 2013, he \"was involved with an effort to to help prosecutors get their first pay raise in more than 10 years.\"\nSince a merit pay system was eliminated in 2003, assistant district attorneys could not get merit raises or \"step\" raises -- to a higher place on the pay scale -- until a new merit and step-pay system was put in place in 2013, with Richards\u2019 help. But prior to that, they received across-the-board raises for five consecutive years, from 2004 through 2008.\nWe rate Richards\u2019 statement False.\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07555"}
