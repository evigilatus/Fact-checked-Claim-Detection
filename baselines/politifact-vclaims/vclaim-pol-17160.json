His presidential ballot attempt.\nWest made a last-ditch effort to land a spot on Wisconsin\u2019s presidential ballot, a move that made Democrats squirm and Republicans willing to lend a hand.\u00a0\nBut the state Elections Commission dealt a blow to West\u2019s planned campaign on Aug. 20, 2020 when it decided that he filed his nomination papers too late.\nAnd Republicans, naturally, blamed Democrats for the outcome.\nIn an Aug. 20, 2020 news release, the Republican Party of Wisconsin issued a news release with a headline that said West\u2019s ballot access was \"denied by liberals.\"\u00a0\n\"Wisconsin Democrats successfully fought to deny ballot access to an African American because he was seconds late with his paperwork, but they want to override Wisconsin law by delaying the deadline to accept absentee ballots because six weeks of ballot harvesting may not be enough for them to win,\" executive director Mark Jefferson said in the statement. \"Let that sink in.\"\nSetting aside the rhetoric, we\u2019re looking at a particular claim \u2014 the one the party chose as its news release headline.\nIs it true that Kanye didn\u2019t get on the ballot because of liberals?\u00a0\nThe background\nFirst, let\u2019s get up to speed on West\u2019s effort in Wisconsin.\u00a0\nOn Aug. 4, 2020, the rapper made a last-minute attempt to appear on Wisconsin\u2019s Nov. 3 ballot as a member of the \"Birthday Party.\" Wisconsin was among several states West targeted, but the effort here gained heightened attention because of the state\u2019s crucial role in the presidential contest.\u00a0\nFrom the beginning, it appeared that West\u2019s campaign failed to deliver his nomination papers in time. Matt Smith, a reporter for WISN-TV in Milwaukee, tweeted a video of Lane Ruhland, an attorney President Donald Trump has used in another matter, walking into the state Election Commission\u2019s building with West\u2019s paperwork just after the 5 p.m. deadline.\nThe state Democratic Party subsequently filed a complaint saying West submitted his papers late, used bogus signatures such as \"Mickey Mouse\" and duped people into signing on his behalf. West\u2019s campaign acknowledged it filed the papers 14 seconds past 5 p.m., but argued he wouldn\u2019t have been \"late\" until 5:01 p.m. and should still appear on the ballot.\nThe campaign\u2019s attorney also argued West was hindered by Democrats, the media and state elections officials.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat brings us to Aug. 20, when the state Elections Commission followed a staff recommendation and decided to keep West off the ballot. On a 5-1 vote, the commission determined that West didn\u2019t file his paperwork in time.\u00a0\n\"I regret it's the case,\" said Dean Knudson, a former Republican state lawmaker appointed to a GOP slot on the commission. \"I do not feel they filed timely.\"\nThe work of liberals?\nWhen asked for evidence to support the GOP\u2019s claim, party spokesman Alec Zimmerman accused Democrats of being \"hypocritical\" and argued their claim focused on the actions of Democrats, not the commission.\u00a0\n\"The candidate was presumed ballot access until the Democrats filed the challenge,\" Zimmerman said. \"He would not have been denied access had the complaint by the Democrats not been filed.\"\nBut Zimmerman\u2019s assertion is not correct.\u00a0\nReid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said the commission routinely denies ballot access to candidates without a challenge when there are issues with the paperwork, such as not securing the minimum number of signatures required.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, the complaint filed by the state Democratic Party was one of two before the board. The second complaint was submitted by Joseph Santeler, an attorney for a Milwaukee bank. Little is known about his political involvement outside of $50 donations to Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 campaign and to former Gov. Scott Walker.\u00a0\nIn the end, when it came time for a decision, two Republican appointees joined the Democratic appointees in voting to keep West off the ballot.\u00a0\nOnly Republican Commissioner Robert Spindell thought West should be on the ballot.\u00a0\nOf note, Spindell had this to say in June 2020 when a challenge to nomination papers for state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, came in past the deadline:\n\"There\u2019s been a long tradition over many, many years and I know personally many candidates that for various reasons or challenges or whatever didn\u2019t get it in on time. They went to the wrong location. They had a flat tire. They didn\u2019t catch the elevator. They were two minutes late. The situation with this type of problem is pretty clear in our past history, and I would suspect that two minutes is two minutes past the deadline.\"\nOur ruling\nIn a statement, the Republican Party of Wisconsin said West\u2019s access to the ballot was \"denied by liberals.\"\nDemocrats led the charge to remove him and arguably had the most to lose if he appeared on the November ballot. But the final decision was bipartisan, with both Democrats and Republicans on the Elections Commission agreeing with a staff recommendation that he filed the paperwork too late.\nOur definition of Mostly False is \"The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\"\nThat fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17160"}
