They do that, and they do that at will because they have no respect for our president and they have no respect for our country.\"\nWe looked at Trump\u2019s that the United States \"rebuilt\" China in a separate fact-check. But we were curious about Trump\u2019s claim that China is now building a groundbreaking fortress in the South China Sea.\nThe Trump campaign didn\u2019t get back to us about his claim, which is exaggerated. While China is expanding aggressively in the South China Sea, it is not constructing a floating Death Star by any means. \nTake me to the South China Sea\nBefore we delve into the South China Sea, let\u2019s go through some basics.\nSeveral Asian nations have been fighting over hundreds of small islands, reefs, atolls and sandbanks in the South China Sea for centuries. Though largely uninhabitable, the area is a potential treasure trove of oil and gas. The waters are also home to some of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, where $5 trillion of trade passes through every year. \u00a0\nChina and Taiwan both claim the good majority of the area and contend their sovereignty dates back, at the very latest, to Kublai Khan in 1293. Vietnam disputes this and says it\u2019s ruled the key island chains, the Spratlys and the Paracels, since the 17th century. The Philippines\u2019 claim for the Spratlys and the Scarborough Shoal is one of geographical proximity. Malaysia and Brunei, meanwhile, say parts of the waters fall within their United Nations-defined economic exclusion zones.\nThe United States, for its part, has no claim on the territories, but it has significant interests at stake. Assistant Defense Secretary David Shear, in congressional testimony last year, listed \"peaceful resolution of disputes, freedom of navigation and overflight, and other internationally lawful uses of the sea related to these freedoms, unimpeded lawful commerce, respect for international law, and the maintenance of peace and stability.\"\nOf particular concern to the United States is China\u2019s ambitions to militarize the South China Sea and achieve \"hegemony in East Asia,\" in the words of Navy Adm. Harry Harris Jr.\nChina retorted that it\u2019s the United States that\u2019s militarizing in the region and escalating tensions.\nAs a show of force, the Obama administration is sending Navy patrols to the region. According to the New York Times, Pentagon officials said these exercises were meant to convey the message that the \"United States is the dominant military power in the region.\" In response, a spokesperson for Beijing\u2019s defense ministry warned the United States to \"be careful,\" according to the AFP.\nHistorical and legal arguments aside, the grab for the islands didn\u2019t really begin until the 20th century, with military clashes and diplomatic stand-offs springing up every couple of years. And to assert their claims, all of the countries except Brunei have been building outposts and artificial islands in the South China Sea for decades. We\u2019ll explain how an island can be artificial in a bit.\nVietnam and the Philippines were the most active in island-building in the early 2000s, and they, along with Taiwan, have stationed military forces on some outposts, according to Reuters. But in recent years, however, China has been the dominant player.\nSince 2014, China has staked out about 2,000 acres in the South China Sea and built seven artificial islands and three airstrips in the Spratlys. This is \"more land than all other claimants combined over the history of their claims,\" Shear told Congress.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say Trump has a point that this reclamation and level of assertiveness is unprecedented. \u00a0Larry Wortzel, a member of the congressional United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, noted that China\u2019s buildup this time around is significantly improved in technical capacity, scope and modernity.\nThe artificial islands themselves, however, are not \"the likes of which the world has never seen.\"\nFloating but not exactly fortified\nArtificial islands are made by building concrete platforms, docks, airtrips and other landmass structures onto reefs and sand cays in the Spratlys. For example, China created about 114,000 square meters (about the size of 20 football fields) of new land in the Spratlys by constructing a large supply platform on a reef, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.\n(Photo from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative)\nThough many in the media have taken to calling these artificial islands \"fortresses\" \u2014 a term that typically refers to a stronghold that can defend against attacks \u2014 they don\u2019t quite live up to the name yet.\n\"It seems a bit premature to say that China is building a military fortress,\" said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nFor one, while Beijing will likely use the islands for military purposes, it\u2019s been deliberately unclear about its intentions and hasn\u2019t deployed any aircraft or missiles yet, Glaser told PolitiFact. Thus far, these outposts only have radars and dual-use equipment, according to Patrick Cronin, the senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\n\"A military fortress would be more obvious than China\u2019s preferred exploitation of grey-zone situations and use of incremental tactics \u2014 salami-slicing incremental moves to improve China\u2019s position,\" Cronin said.\nFor another, the military infrastructure China has built is far from unbreachable and, in fact, pretty vulnerable to attack.\n\"These facilities are quite limited and though they offer a headache to the region in peacetime, they would not be a major threat to U.S. or allied forces in a conflict,\" said Gregory Poling, the director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nTrump may have been referring to the military base on Hainan Island or the surface-to-air missiles deployed on Woody Island in the Paracels. But the two are different from the recently constructed artificial islands. Hainan Island, which is roughly the size of Belgium, is not one of the contested territories. Woody Island, though contested and becoming increasingly fortified, has been under Chinese control since 1946.\nCronin noted that some analysts have speculated that China may be looking to form a triangle of bases to fortify its position \u2014 perhaps the closest thing to a \"military fortress\" \u2014 but \"this is more of a long-term idea than a reality China can defend.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, China is\u00a0\"in the South China Sea and (building)\u00a0a military fortress the likes of which perhaps the world has not seen.\"\nChina made large land grabs in the South China Sea and has constructed several artificial islands in the region.\u00a0However, it's\u00a0a stretch for Trump to say these outposts that could be used for military purposes\u00a0amount to a fortress.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05162"}
