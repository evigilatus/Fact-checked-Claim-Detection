Appling leads Wisconsin Family Council and Wisconsin Family Action, which describe themselves as advocating for Judeo-Christian values.\nIn that 2006 referendum, 59 percent of voters in the fall general election endorsed rewriting the state constitution in a way that legally recognizes marriage only as \"between one man and one woman.\"\nThe referendum language also prohibited the state from recognizing \"a legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in October 2014 rejected appeals from Wisconsin and four other states seeking to preserve their same-sex marriage bans.\nNationally, it\u2019s well documented that attitudes toward gay marriage have become more much more accepting in recent years. Thirty-six states have legalized gay marriage.\nBut what about in Wisconsin?\nAsked to provide backup for her claim of no dramatic change, Appling pointed in part to two polls from 2014. Neither, however, broke out any Wisconsin data.\nOne surveyed only Republicans or GOP-leaning independents and found large majorities favoring a traditional definition of marriage. The other was from surveys of people as they exited polling places across the country; it showed voters evenly split on gay marriage nationally.\nBut Appling cited public opinion in Wisconsin, not nationwide.\nShe did point us to a Wisconsin statewide poll conducted by St. Norbert College in 2014 -- but it doesn\u2019t entirely back her point. It found a slim majority (52 percent) in favor of the 2006 amendment\u2019s language regarding marriage for \"one man\" and \"one woman.\" Remember, it passed with 59 percent support, so that\u2019s a substantial drop.\nWhen we looked ourselves, we found a fairly small number of Wisconsin polls that were on point, but they document relatively large changes in opinion.\nThe St. Norbert \"Wisconsin Survey\" sampled opinion on the \"one man-one woman\" language even before the referendum went to voters, and has continued to do so.\nFrom that poll, here are the percentages in favor of the \"one man-one woman\" approach advocated 2006 referendum.\nSpring 2004: 66 percent\nSpring 2006: 61 percent\nSpring 2012: 56 percent\nSpring 2014: 52 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, while a bare majority in this survey still backed the traditional view, support for it has fallen 14 percentage points in a decade.\nOther polls\nThe Marquette University Law School Poll tested the issue three times in 2014, and its findings were at odds with the St. Norbert poll.\nThat poll found between 55 percent and 64 percent support for \"allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally.\" The portion against legal marriage for such couples ranged in size from 30 percent to 37 percent.\nThat suggests an even bigger change in opinion and suggests a reversal from the 2006 referendum vote. Such comparisons are imperfect, though, due to factors such as the unpredictability of who shows up to vote and the impact of the wording of survey questions.\nThe MU Law Poll was launched just three years ago, so it does not have a long history on this question.\nBut we found a couple other sources.\nIn an August 2011 poll, \u00a0Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning firm, found exactly half of respondents thought same-sex marriage should be illegal, with 39 percent saying legal.\nBy spring 2014, the firm for the first time found more in favor of legalizing than against: 47 to 45 percent, though the two-point gap is smaller than the poll\u2019s margin of error.\nExit polls provide more evidence. Surveys taken in November 2014 as voters left polling places asked if Wisconsin should legally recognize same-sex marriage.\nYes, said 52 percent. No, said 45 percent.\nOne more finding before we close.\nPollsters sometimes throw in other options when asking about how to handle the marriage question. They will ask respondents what is closer to their own view: legalizing same-sex marriage, giving civil recognition to such unions, or giving no legal recognition to them.\nThese results also show major changes in opinion, though support for same-sex marriage comes in lower.\nIn 2009, the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank, found 27 percent support for same-sex marriage, 32 percent for civil unions but not same-sex marriage, and 35 percent for no legal recognition.\nIn May 2014, five years later, the Marquette poll posed the same question using the exact same language. It found 49 percent support for same-sex marriage, 25 percent for civil unions and 19 percent for no recognition.\nThat\u2019s a change of 22 points for same-sex marriage.\nOur rating\nIn saying a do-over of the state\u2019s 2006 referendum legalizing only opposite-sex marriages would again pass, Appling said public opinion polls on gay marriage \"are not dramatically changing.\"\nHer remarks were squarely in a Wisconsin context, and surveys here have shown major change in favor of legalizing same-sex marriages.\nWe rate her claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06835"}
