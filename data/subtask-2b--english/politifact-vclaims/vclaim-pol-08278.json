Or at least, that is one way to read the roster of the official delegation to the games in Sochi.\nFormer Homeland Security director Janet Napolitano leads the group named by the White House. CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley reminded Napolitano of how administrations have handled this before.\n\"I'm sure it's been noted to you, that it's been 14 years since a president or a vice president or a member of their family has not gone and attended at least an event at the Olympics,\" Crowley said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \"Can you tell me as a practitioner of both policy and politics why Sochi is different for the U.S.?\"\nNapolitano denied that any snub of Russian President Vladimir Putin was intended. Obama, she said, had sent a group that \"represented the broad values of the United States.\"\nThe Obama administration has made it clear that acceptance of gays and lesbians ranks prominently among those values. When the White House announced the delegation list, a spokesperson said it \"represented the diversity that is the United States.\" The list included the gay tennis star, Billie\u00a0Jean King. Russia\u2019s anti-gay bias has become a sticking point between the two nations.\nThe president himself said his schedule doesn\u2019t allow him to attend.\nThe meaning behind\u00a0the make-up of the delegation\u00a0is a matter for diplomats and students of international relations. In this fact-check, we will look at whether the tradition that Crowley suggested actually has been in place since 2000.\nAs this table shows, the record speaks for itself.\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nCity\n\n\nWho went\n\n\n\n\n1998\n\n\nNagano, Japan\n\n\nTipper Gore\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\n\nSydney, Australia\n\n\nChelsea Clinton\n\n\n\n\n2002\n\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge W.

Crowley\u2019s statement includes the important catch-all category of family member to make her claim accurate.\nAs far back as 1998, the then-wife of Vice President Al Gore, Tipper Gore, represented the White House at the Winter games in Nagano, Japan. For the 2000 Summer games in Sydney, Australia, President Bill Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea, took time off from college to watch the competition. In 2004, it was the president\u2019s father and mother, former President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush, who made the family connection in Athens, Greece.\nGeorge W. Bush stands out for having personally attended twice. The first time, the games took place on American soil in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the leader of the host country pretty much always attends. But Bush also made the trip to Beijing in 2008 where he memorably bumped a volleyball to a bikini clad member of the U.S. beach volleyball team. \nOur ruling\nCrowley said \"a president or a vice president or a member of their family\" has attended every Olympic games since 2000. That is accurate. In fact, the tradition goes back 16 years to 1998.\nWe rate Crowley\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08278"}
