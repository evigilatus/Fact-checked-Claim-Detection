Jeb Bush of Florida.\nShe wrote, \"Despite what the media is telling you, it is clear that Carly deserved to be on the debate stage, both according to their arbitrary metrics\u200a\u2014\u200aand the ones that actually matter:\n\"In an actual contest of voters, Carly came out ahead of Governors Christie and Kasich.\n\"She has the same number of delegates as Governor Bush. Governor Christie has 0.\n\"Carly is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined.\"\nFiorina never managed to snag a spot at the debate, but we decided to take a look at the third of Fiorina\u2019s bullet points -- the one about about her fundraising totals.\n(For the record, she was right on both of the previous two bullet points. Fiorina got 3,485 votes in Iowa, or 1.9 percent, which was ahead of Kasich by 11 votes and ahead of Christie by 201 votes. That translated into one delegate each for Bush and Fiorina and none for Christie.)\nFor fundraising data, we turned to opensecrets.org for the latest presidential fundraising data.\nHere\u2019s the table, in descending order, for hard dollars raised, defined as money raised by the candidate\u2019s own campaign committee. The most recent data available at the time of her Feb. 6 statement was through Dec. 31, 2015. (Opensecrets.org does not have data for one Republican candidate still in the race, former Virginia Gov.
