An enormous amount of time and money was spent by political parties and third-party groups to protect or promote their candidates.\n\nAnd, of course, to attack their rivals\u2019 record.\n\nThe elections are over. But some of the claims lingered with us.\n\nOne involved the Bradley Center, home of the Milwaukee Bucks, Marquette University Golden Eagles, Milwaukee Admirals and Milwaukee Mustangs. With the busy season of the downtown Milwaukee venue just around the corner, we thought we\u2019d take a deeper look.\n\nThe Bradley Center is a $90\u2002million gift to the community from Jane Bradley Pettit in honor of her father, industrialist Harry Lynde Bradley. The facility is a state building but operates without state taxpayer support.\n\nFor years, the Bradley Center board of directors and the Bucks have complained the facility, which opened in 1988, is obsolete for an NBA team. Most recently, the team sought $10 million in borrowing for renovations, a request that Gov. Scott Walker shot down.\n\nIn recent years, a variety of smaller-scale renovations have been undertaken to generate more revenue for the team. That includes a new scoreboard that debuted in the fall of 2010 in an effort to increase advertising revenue.\n\nThat scoreboard popped up in a string of television ads the conservative Wisconsin Club For Growth used to attack Democrats running in the recall elections. For instance, one spot targeted state Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo), who lost to state Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon) in his recall election.\n\n\"Clark voted for $37 million in pork barrel projects, including a $5 million scoreboard for the Milwaukee Bucks,\" the narrator states in the ad.\n\nDid state taxpayers really buy the Bucks a new $5 million scoreboard?\n\nLet\u2019s go to the replay.\n\nWe asked the Club for Growth for backup, and they sent us to a Journal Sentinel story about items included in the budget, and the budget bill itself.\n\nSo, we dug further.\n\nThe Bradley Center board sought state assistance for the facility, arguing for the economic benefits that the facility provides to Milwaukee. The request was heard in 2009 by the state Building Commission, which handles requests for large-scale construction projects.\n\nThe commission voted April 1, 2009, to recommended a $5 million grant for the Bradley Center, and the amount was included in the proposed 2009-\u201911 state budget.\n\nAmong those voting to approve the borrowing was commission member Dean Kaufert, Republican member of the state Assembly from Neenah. Clark was not a member of the commission, nor were any of the Democrats targeted by the Club for Growth ads.\n\nThe bonding for the Bradley Center was then included in the budget by then-Gov. Jim Doyle.\n\nAl Runde, an analyst at the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, said there was no amendment made to remove the Bradley Center funding from the budget package. In other words, there was no separate vote on that item.\n\n(After this item was published, our attention was directed to a budget amendment that would have -- among other things -- cut the funding for the Bradley Center and nine other projects approved by the Building Commission. That amendment was tabled on a 51-47 vote with Clark voting in the majority.)\n\nThe budget was approved by the Democratic-controlled Legislature with Clark among those voting in favor of it.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this type of approach before, where a vote for an entire budget is used to hammer home a point on one relatively small item contained within it. This often distorts what really happens in the Legislative process.\n\nBeyond that, the Club for Growth\u2019s claim is off base when it says the $5 million went for a scoreboard.\n\n\"Nothing in the act says anything about the scoreboard, just general funding\" for the Bradley Center, Runde said.\n\nThe Bradley Center spent $1.29 million of the state money on the $3.2 million scoreboard, said Evan Zeppos, spokesman for the center\u2019s board. The state funds also went to repair concrete, lighting, elevator and escalator maintenance, plumbing, flooring and a new hockey dasher-board system, he said.\n\nThe Bradley Center has not yet spent the entire $5 million, and more than $580,000 remains on hand, Zeppos said.\n\nZeppos noted the scoreboard isn\u2019t just for the Bucks. Marquette, the Admirals and other tenants also use it.\n\n\"It\u2019s for everything we do there,\" Zeppos said.\n\nLet\u2019s settle the score on this one.\n\nThe Wisconsin Club for Growth said Clark and other Democrats voted for $5 million for a new scoreboard for the Bradley Center.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Clark had an opportunity to vote yea or nay on that specific matter, although he did vote to table an amendment that included the Bradley Center funding and numerous other projects. And it\u2019s a reach to make a specific charge against him for an item that was wrapped in a broader vote. What\u2019s more -- and more importantly -- the group misstates how the state money was used. About a fourth of the money went to the scoreboard. And it\u2019s not specific to the Bucks.\n\nSo it\u2019s wrong in multiple ways. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12510"}
