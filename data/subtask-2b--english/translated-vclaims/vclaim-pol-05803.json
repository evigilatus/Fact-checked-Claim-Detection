Chris Christy drew faint laughters in the presidential Republican debate in Boulder, Colo. When he described the democratic sphere as \"social, solitary, pessimist -- and for me, I can't know which.\" He went to see Sean Bernie Sanders from Vermont, one of the three democratic candidates. \"The socialists say they'll pay for everything and give you everything for free, but they don't tell you they'll raise your taxes to 90% to do it.\" This echoed Donald Trump &apos; s claim at a rally in Richmond, Va, on 14 October 2015. At that gathering, Trump Sanders called \"communist\" and said that tax increases would come to everyone, not just billionaire. Trump said at Richmond's rally, referring to the democratic debate the night before. \"You will be taxed by 90%. It'll take everything. And no one heard the term communism, but you know what? I'll call it socialist/communist, okay? 'Cause that's what it is. There is no doubt that Sanders wants to raise taxes on the richest 1%: \"Yes, we will ask Trump and his billionaire friends to pay more taxes. We're gonna get to this rate. But it's going to be much higher than it is now, \"Sanders said in the 18 October interview with ABC this week. But do you want Sanders to tax Americans on average at 90 per cent as well? Here, we will summarize the problems that we found in relation to Tramp's claim and address why Christy's claim was equally problematic. What Sanders said has not yet issued a tax plan -- the Center for Non-Party Tax Policy has a summary of the tax plans of the candidates here -- and we searched Lexie Nyxes and CQ and found that Sanders has never explicitly proposed a 90 per cent tax rate for billionaires, let alone applying this rate to everyone. The confusion may arise from the comments made by Sanders in May 2015 on the marginal tax rate of the very rich. In an interview with CNBC, Sanders does not believe that the highest marginal tax rate of 90% is very high. Before we express its suspension, let us review what the marginal tax rate means. The tax rate is applied to the last dollar you earn. The United States tax system is based on tax brackets. Let's say you were a single filewriter who got $410,000 in total income adjusted last year. The tax on the first $9,075 was 10 per cent, from $9,076 to $36,900 was taxed at 15 per cent, from $36,901 to $89,350 was taxed at 25 per cent, from $89,351 to $186,350 at 28 per cent, from $186,351 to $405,100 was taxed at 33 per cent, from $405,101 to $406,750 were taxed at 35 per cent, and the amount above $406,751 was taxed at 39.6 per cent. (The dollar levels differ for other types of filers, such as spouses who file joint declarations.) In other words, the currently highest marginal tax rate is 39.6 per cent, affecting individuals earning more than $400,000 annually. This is almost the threshold for making it the highest 1% of income if you apply as an individual. Even for this sample file, which earns $410,000, the tax rate is 39.6 per cent, reaching only a relatively small amount of their income. The average American never sees marginal federal income tax rates as high. \"If my memory is correct, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the highest marginal tax rate was like 90 percent,\" said Sanders on May 26. ........................................................................................... \"That's not 90 percent of your income, you know? This is the margin.\" Many on the right and left thought Sanders' comments called for a top 90 percent. But Camp Sanders told us that Senator Vermont made it clear that that's not what he's saying. In addition to what his camp told us, the review of his previous comments - one from 2008 and four from this year - does not seem to be committed in any way: on January 10, 2021, \"Trap refers to the insurgency law - General Flynn to be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 - November 5, 2008, on Fox News, your world with Neil Cafoto: Sanders said from the highest tax rates, \"No, of course, it won't be 90%. Saunders said, under pressure from Cavoto as a character, \"Neal, I will not develop a tax policy in a three-minute segment of your program.\" \u2022 June 2, 2015 in Yahoo! News: In response to Katie Corick's suggestion that he proposed a 90 per cent tax on the richest Americans, Sanders intervened: \"No, I didn't. That's not true. This is one of these things that seems to be going on. We did not come up with a formal tax proposal. Are we going to raise the rate of individual taxes for the rich? Of course, but we haven't figured it out yet.\" \u2022 11 June 2015 on Charlie Rose: \"We are now working on a comprehensive tax package which I believe will exceed 50 per cent for the highest marginal rates.\" \u2022 18 September 2015 on CBS this morning: \"No, I don't think you have to go up to 90%. I don't know if you have to go there, but we'll come up with some very specific ideas.\" \u2022 23 September 2015 on the new day of CNN: \"If you are very rich, yes, you will pay more taxes. If you're a big company today, by the way, that's hiding your money in the Cayman Islands and not paying nickel in federal taxes, yeah, you'll pay taxes.\" In short, the more specific figure we found from Sanders at the highest marginal tax rate is not dramatically defined - \"more than 50 per cent\" - and will affect only a small fraction of Americans. There's nothing certain but corporate taxation and this is the most problematic point with this claim -- which assumes that Sanders' 90 percent tax will affect. Both Trump and now Christy have indicated that everyone will essentially be subject to 90 percent tax increases. With Trump, this rate is supposed to be imposed on \"you people\" in the audience at his gathering. Christy, for his part, Sanders said \"up your taxes to 90 percent.\" But no matter how high President Sanders will seek to implement it -- based on his comments, something south of 90 per cent -- will be directed mostly to the richest Americans, including rising taxes on the largest real estate and commercial transactions and eliminating tax moratoriums on American companies abroad. The only exception is his call for paid family and medical leave, based on the legislation enacted by Mr. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., which requires a \"simple increase in the salary tax\" that would infect everyone, as Sanders said this week. How small is it? Employers and employees will reduce an additional 0.2 per cent each, raising the federal salary tax from 12.4 per cent to 12.8 per cent. According to a report from the Gilbert office, this is equivalent to $72.04 per annum for the average worker and $227.40 for the highest paid worker. Moreover, there is some doubt that Sanders could achieve his policy proposals without additional tax increases. In fact, one tax expert warned against guessing because Sanders was very vague about his proposals. Roberton Williams of the Center for Non-Party Tax Policy said when we reviewed Trump's original claim. \"Organizations usually wait until a fully formulated plan is in place before trying to model it. Saunders isn't near that point yet.\" Christy the Governor said that Sanders' plan was \"to raise your taxes to 90 percent.\" Sanders did not release an official tax plan, either for billionaires or for anyone else. However, based on his earlier comments and proposals, the tax policies advocated by Sanders target rich companies and Americans. Sanders rejected the idea that he wanted to set marginal tax rates for the billionaire by 90 per cent. Overall, his tax proposals so far do not envisage raising your \"taxes\" -- that is, ordinary Americans' taxes -- to anything close to 90%. This is a blatantly misleading description of the extent and scope of Sanders' plan, so we value Christy's claim for pants on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94917f97-e53e-4d00-8f83-c9f2de668891", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05803"}
