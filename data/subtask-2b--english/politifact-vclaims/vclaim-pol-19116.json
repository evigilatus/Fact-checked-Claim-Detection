Ron Johnson changes tune on objecting to Electoral College results", "text": "It\u2019s a new year, and the turmoil surrounding the 2020 presidential election still isn\u2019t over.\nCongress convenes on Jan. 6, 2021 to count the Electoral College votes that show President-elect Joe Biden defeating President Donald Trump 306 to 232. Vice President Mike Pence, acting as Senate president, will open the sealed certificates from each state, hand them to tellers to read aloud and call for any objections to the results.\nThat\u2019s where Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson plans to come in.\u00a0\u00a0\nJohnson and 10 other Republican senators and senators-elect issued a statement on Jan. 2, 2021 saying they will object to the votes in \"disputed states\" unless an election audit is completed.\u00a0\nThe move came as Trump and his allies have continued to try to cast doubt on the Nov. 3 election despite no evidence of widespread fraud and nearly 60 failed legal attempts to overturn the results.\nWeeks before that, Johnson was singing a different tune about the Jan. 6 session. So we decided to break out our Flip-O-Meter.\u00a0\nReminder: We\u2019re not measuring whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. We\u2019re just examining whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views.\nLet\u2019s take a look.\nThen\nA Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter asked Johnson on Dec. 15, 2020 whether he planned to object to the Electoral College votes.\u00a0\n\"No, I don\u2019t have any plans,\" Johnson said. \"Something would have to surface that would call into question the legitimacy of the election. Again, so far nothing has \u2026 again, plenty of irregularities, things that need to be investigated.\"\nHe went on to say he regarded the election as legitimate and accepted Biden as president-elect. The next day, however, he held a Senate hearing to discuss election \"irregularities\" and argued that legitimate questions had been raised about how it was administered in Wisconsin and other states.\u00a0\nStill, Johnson said he didn\u2019t anticipate a level of fraud that would change the election\u2019s outcome.\n\"Today we will hear testimony on \u2026 how fraudulent voting did occur, as it always does,\" he said during the hearing. \"The question that follows is whether the level of fraud would alter the outcome of the election. This year, through dozens of court cases, through the certification process in each state, and by the electoral college vote, the conclusion has collectively been reached that it would not.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow\nJohnson\u2019s more recent comments, however, paint an entirely different picture.\nIn their statement, Johnson and his Republican colleagues claimed that the 2020 election \"featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.\"\nJohnson added to that in a Jan. 4, 2021 talk radio appearance, saying 50 to 70 million Americans \"have real legitimate suspicions that this election was stolen\" \u2014 but offered nothing more than suspicions, which Trump and others helped stoke.\nThat same day, he said on Fox News that affirming the results would turn a blind eye to alleged problems in certain states. Again, he did not offer specifics on new evidence, but rather past allegations that have been litigated in lawsuits and other forums.\nHe also appeared on the conservative Newsmax network and argued for an investigation, saying fraud allegations need to be taken seriously.\u00a0\n\"There's so many irregularities here,\" Johnson said in the interview.\nJohnson has not said whether he\u2019ll challenge his own state, but the results in Wisconsin have been disputed multiple times after Biden won by a narrow margin similar to the victory Trump secured in 2016.\u00a0\nSpokesmen for Johnson did not respond to PolitiFact Wisconsin\u2019s inquiry about what changed the senator\u2019s mind.\nBut here\u2019s what hasn\u2019t changed: Courts across the country, including the nation\u2019s highest, continue to throw out lawsuits brought by Trump allies alleging the election was rigged. And as of Dec. 23, 2020, only a handful of fraud cases had emerged in battleground states \u2014 including one woman charged in suburban Milwaukee.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s hardly unprecedented.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nJohnson said in mid-December that he had no plans to object to the Electoral College results that Congress will tally on Jan. 6. He spoke of potential \"irregularities\" in certain states but overall considered the election to be legitimate.\nWeeks later, he joined other Republicans in pledging to object despite no evidence emerging that points to rampant fraud.\u00a0\nWe give Johnson a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19116"}
