The site has a banner reading \"Fox News: The FB Page,\" and several other posts resembling news stories.\nThis particular post was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fake, part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to battle fabricated stories in news feeds.\nThe story built on a real news story from NPR about the Big Easy replacing Confederate icons around the city. This particular account is from May 11, recounting how work crews had to remove the Davis statue in the middle of the night after \"death threats against city officials and contractors.\"\nThe TDAlliance.com post used bits and pieces from that real story, then added fake news that an Obama statue will take Davis\u2019 place.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisiana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars,\" the story read. It also added that the Davis monument would be \"melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.\"\nLooking at the crude composite image plastered on the story, we saw a familiar sight: A real bronze statue of Obama installed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, back in 2012. When last we saw this statue, it was erroneously cited as being erected in the White House (read here for more about\u00a0that contrived tale).\nTDAlliance.com appears to alter existing news stories, or make subtle changes to comments from officials in myriad posts.
