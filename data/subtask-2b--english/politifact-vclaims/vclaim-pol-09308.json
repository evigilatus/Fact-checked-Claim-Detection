Joe Sanfelippo changed as it worked its way from drafting through passage to the desk of Gov. Scott Walker, a former Milwaukee County executive who is expected to sign it.\n\nBut the fundamentals haven\u2019t changed since Sanfelippo unveiled his first draft in January 2013.\n\nFrom the get-go, the West Allis representative wanted voters to decide on trimming Milwaukee County supervisors' pay. The initial proposal was a cut from $50,679 to $15,000 a year. In the bill\u2019s final version, the April 2014 referendum still deals with supervisors\u2019 pay, but the pay cut is smaller -- about 50%, reducing the salary to about $24,000. The precise pay is tied to per-capita income in Milwaukee County. If voters approve the pay cut, supervisors would lose health and pension benefits.\n\nBut a reading of the final bill shows that county voters will not be asked whether the County Board\u2019s budget should be cut by two-thirds under a budget-capping formula outlined in the bill.\n\nThere is no referendum on the budget cap, contrary to what Vukmir\u2019s May 15 release stated.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s been true since Sanfelippo first went public with a draft in mid-January.\n\nA Journal Sentinel story on his announcement was headlined: \"A $5 million cut to County Board budget won\u2019t go before voters.\" (The cut initially was larger than in the final bill; it\u2019s now about $4 million).\n\nBottom line: The bulk of the hoped-for $4 million savings annually in the County Board budget would be accomplished if Walker signs the legislation -- without voters weighing in.\n\nSimilarly, without requiring voters to sign off, the bill requires supervisors to stand for election every two years instead of every four, and scales back the board\u2019s role in contracts, land sales and labor negotiations, as the Journal Sentinel reported.\n\nVukmir aide Jason Booth blamed confusion about the contents of the bill for the error on the scope of the referendum.\n\nProponents of the bill, including current Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele and top Milwaukee business leaders, say it would restore authority to the county executive\u2019s office and streamline county decision-making.\n\nSanfelippo has claimed his bill puts Milwaukee County Board spending in line with other major counties. We rated that statement Mostly True. Sanfelippo, himself a former Milwaukee County Board member, thinks supervisors should be part-time citizen legislators starting in 2016.\n\nBut others see the legislation as an anti-democratic power grab that will put too much power in the executive branch.\n\n\"With the long history of Milwaukee County Executives abusing their power, this bill is a dangerous step in the wrong direction, Senate Democratic Leader Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, said upon passage. \"Unfortunately, this bill flies in the face of the trust in the people of Milwaukee County and our Democratic system.\"\n\nOur rating\n\nVukmir contended that Milwaukee County voters would decide whether the County Board budget takes a big cut.\n\nThat\u2019s wrong. A referendum would determine County Board supervisors\u2019 pay, but most of the changes in the bill -- including the County Board\u2019s budget level -- would take effect directly through the legislation, without voter approval in 2014.\n\nWe rate her claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09308"}
