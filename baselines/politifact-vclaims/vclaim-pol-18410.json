But the Nov. 1 posts, which sought to portray Biden as mentally unfit to run for president, rest on doctored video.\nThe posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nPosts such as this one shared a brief clip of Biden walking to a podium accompanied by music, in front of a banner that said, \"Battle for the Soul of the Nation.\" Biden then tells the crowd, \"Hello Minnesota!\"\nIn the clip being shared on social media, the banner includes \"Tampa, Florida\" and a sign on the lectern says, \"Text FL to 30330.\"\nHowever, neither the Tampa label on the banner nor the \"FL\" suggestion for texts on the sign were present at the actual event, which was held in St. Paul, Minn., on Oct. 30. The actual banner said \"Text MN to 30330,\" as did the sign on the lectern.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot from a Bloomberg news video of the moment captured in the social media posts. (Watch the original on YouTube.)\n\nPeople who know anything about Florida might also have noticed the banner\u2019s design, which features mountains receding to the horizon, a geographic feature that doesn\u2019t exist in Florida. Oh, and the music is by Twin Cities native Prince.\nMeanwhile, Biden\u2019s Florida sign the day before was different, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\nSocial media posts said Biden told a crowd in Florida \"Hello Minnesota!\" However, the video used to back up this claim has been manipulated. The event took place in Minnesota, and had Minnesota specific touches that were doctored out of the widely shared clip.
