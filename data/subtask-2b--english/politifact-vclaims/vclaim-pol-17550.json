Man photographed at Baghdad U.S. embassy protest visited the White House in 2011", "text": "After U.S. airstrikes killed fighters of Iran-backed militia in Iraq, protesters broke into the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Dec. 31, 2019, in what the Associated Press called \"one of the worst attacks on the embassy in recent memory.\"\nSeveral days later, social media posts including this one on Facebook identified a man photographed in a crowd as the \"guy who led the storming of the U.S. embassy.\"\nThe Jan. 4 post paired the image with a second photo captured at the White House on Dec. 12, 2011. The post says that one of the people photographed with then-President Barack Obama and then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is the same person. \"Also guy who led the storming of the U.S. embassy,\" the wording over the Facebook image reads.\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe looked into it. And while it we can\u2019t verify what role this man played in the Dec. 31 U.S. Embassy raid (we find nothing indicating he \"led\" it as the post suggests), it does appear he was in attendance there as well as being a White House visitor years earlier during the Obama administration.\u00a0\nNews outlets like the Associated Press are reporting that a man named Hadi al-Amiri was among commanders of militia factions loyal to Iran who joined protesters outside the embassy on Dec. 31. In 2011, Amiri, then Iraq\u2019s transportation minister, did indeed visit the White House.

Fox News reported \"it is unclear what Amiri\u2019s level of involvement was in the siege.\" The Associated Press said he \"joined the protesters outside the embassy in a strikingly bold move.\" In a story headlined, \"These 3 pro-Iran militia leaders are provoking protesters at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad,\" the Washington Post said he was \"also in attendance.\"\u00a0\nBut he is the same person who visited the White House in 2011.\u00a0\nA viral Facebook post displays two pictures \u2014 one taken at the White House in 2011 and one taken at a protest outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in December 2019 \u2014 and says they show the same man was at both.
