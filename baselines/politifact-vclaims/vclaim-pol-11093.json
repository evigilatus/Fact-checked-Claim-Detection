Bill Nelson\u2019s vote in favor of the federal health care law, saying in a new television ad that the law will \"be a nightmare for Florida seniors.\"\n\nThe ad includes a statement from Nelson supporting the health care law but interrupts Nelson to suggest his statement is inaccurate. (Watch it here.)\n\nThe narrator in the ad, among other things, says that \"seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare.\"\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re fact-checking here -- and have fact-checked many times before.\n\nBy way of introduction, Medicare serves as the health insurance program for 39 million seniors and another eight million people under 65 receiving Social Security. Medicare makes up about 12 percent of the federal budget. Medicare reforms were part of the 2010 health care legislation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSome of the changes included in the health care law increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage, said Tricia Neuman, who is vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation -- a trusted independent source. For instance, the health care law adds $5 billion to help cover prevention services and $43 billion to help fill in a gap for enrollees purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program (sometimes called the doughnut hole).\n\nOther changes reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help pay for coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation, Neuman said. And yet other provisions are designed to improve the delivery and quality of care. (Neuman explains the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website. It's the best non-ideological explanation we've seen.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe key to this claim is the fact that the health care law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending increases over the next 10 years.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn fact, Medicare spending will still increase.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. So while the health care law reduces the amount of projected spending increases in Medicare, the law doesn't cut Medicare.\n\nPut simpler, Medicare\u2019s budget will continue to grow -- just at a smaller rate than had originally been projected.\n\nThe chamber is correct on one point, however: The spending reductions to Medicare are intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the new health care law.\n\nOn May 14, 2012, lawyers for Nelson wrote to Florida TV stations asking them not to air the ad because of the Medicare claim.\n\n\"Just last Friday, FactCheck.org, a non-partisan, non-profit consumer advocate project with the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, examined this ad and reported: \u2018Chamber Continues To Mislead On Healthcare Law.\u2019 In addition, the Pulitzer Prize-winning, \u00a0independent non-profit organization PolitiFact has reported a number of times that the claim is \u2018false\u2019,\" lawyers Kendall Coffey and Abigail Parent wrote.\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve rated claims about the $500 billion in \"cuts\" to Medicare anywhere from Half True to Mostly False to False, depending on how they were worded.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber said that \"seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare.\" That\u2019s largely incorrect. Medicare spending is still set to increase, just not at as high a rate as originally anticipated. The difference, about $500 billion, is being used to help fund other provisions in the new health care law. \u00a0That\u2019s the small kernel of truth in this claim, which we rate Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitiFact Florida and 10 News are partnering for the 2012 election season.
