The majority party in the Senate, which aims to elect Democrats, has published a radio announcement urging greater participation among black voters. The ad is attacking Tom Teal'c, the Republican Speaker of North Carolina House, challenging the Democratic Kai Hagan. The Declaration makes a series of allegations about Teal'c, including this announcement: \"Till Teal's led the effort to pass some kind of \"stand-by\" law that killed Travon Martin. Several allegations concerning the Trajvon Martin case were examined by Polyte Fact. Did Florida's law \"stand on your land\" cause his death? The radio announcement was picked up by the conservative blogger, Sister Toldja, and raised the media &apos; s attention. He led a conservative group to counter-attack by radio accusing Democrats of \"ethnic entertainment.\" While we are focusing on the claim that Florida's law \"stand on your land\" killed Travon, other media reports have explained the role of Teal'c in North Carolina's law, for which Teal'c voted. On February 26, 2012, the fatal shooting of Travon Martin from Miami Gardens, and the acquittal of George Zimmerman the following year, triggered political debate about race, arms rights and Florida law \"Stay on your land.\" This law was approved by the legislature by an overwhelming majority and signed by the Government. The Bush pocket in 2005 allows people to use lethal force when they believe that their lives are in danger. This law, promoted by the National Guns Assembly, is now in some 20 states. Trivon was 17 years old, returning from a store and walking in a closed neighborhood where he lived with his father. Zimmerman, a Spanish white neighborhood guard, called a non-emergency police number to report Trevon as \"suspicious.\" This was followed by a violent conflict and Zimmerman shot and killed Trajvon. Zimmerman waived his right to a pre-trial \"stand-by\" hearing, which he did not mention in his defence during the trial. However, the law states in the jury's instructions: \"If George Zimmerman is not engaged in illegal activity and has attacked wherever he has the right to be, he has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand on his territory and face force, including lethal force, if he reasonably believes it necessary to do so to prevent death or serious bodily harm to him or others or to prevent the commission of a coercive crime.\" In July 2013, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. After the verdict was handed down, Dan Gilbert, a former federal prosecutor and legislator in Miami Beach, who was critical of the law in 2005, wrote on his blog that the jury would have received different instructions under the old law, who said: \"The defendant cannot justify the use of force that would cause death or serious bodily harm unless he uses all reasonable means within his authority and in accordance with his integrity to avoid danger before resorting to such force. (Gilber is now adviser to Charlie Christ's Democratic Campaign for Governor in Florida.) On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio said in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders?\" By Miriam Valferde on January 29, 2021, it is difficult to determine how the law of \"stand on your land\" affects the jury's decision. A jury told CNN Anderson Cooper that the jury discussed the law \"Stay on your ground.\" It's getting very confusing. We had things thrown at us. We had a second-degree murder charge, a manslaughter charge, and then we had self-defense, \"Stop on your ground,\" and I think there was another one. The juror, who was not named, said that the charge of murder or manslaughter did not apply \"because of the heat of the moment and \"stand on your ground.\" \"But while the law of \"stand on your ground\" could have played a role for the jury, the law itself did not pull the trigger in the shooting. It's impossible to fully assess Zimmerman's thinking when he shot Trevon, but it could have been a factor that Zimmerman was an eager cop -- he was refused to work in Prince William County, the police department. Racial profiling could have played a role; Trevon was a black teenager wearing a hood. And then we'll mention what's obvious: Zimmerman had a gun. In a television interview in 2012, Zimmerman said that he had never heard of \"stand on your ground\" even after the shooting, although during the trial the prosecution provided evidence that Zimmerman took a criminal trial course where the coach said he covered the law \"Stay on your ground.\" Zimmerman received an \"A\" in the 2010 cycle. The majority support in the Congress refers to an article published by Mother Jones shortly after the acquittal, which indicates that Zimmerman took this course: \"In fact, \"to stand on your land\" played a key role, from Martin's death to Zimmerman's acquittal. Zimmerman was armed and known for \"to stand on your land\" years ago. Tai Matsdorf, the PAC spokesman, did not respond to the questions of Polyte Fruit other than sending us support. He made a statement to The New York Times defending the Declaration in general terms. But the defense lawyers we met said that the law of \"stand on your own land\" did not play a proven role. \"I do not recall any evidence that he made a conscious decision to rely on the law before acting,\" said Kendall Kofi, the former American Attorney General in Miami now in private practice. Maybe \"Stay on your ground\" has led to George Zimmerman's acquittal; this is a more accurate statement. This has also led to further acquittals.\" \"The law did not cause his death,\" said David Weinstein, a former state and federal prosecutor and now a Miami defense attorney. The bullet fired by George Zimmerman is the cause of Travon Martin's death. After the Trajvon case, efforts to get rid of Florida's law \"Stand on your land\" have not gone anywhere in the Republican-led legislature. In fact, the legislature in 2014 added that it applies to warning shots. The law has been a hot topic throughout the country, including the Florida race between the Government of the Republic. Rick Scott and Christ During the 15 October debate at Broward College, Scott said that he would not change the law, while Christ said that he was \"essentially flawed\" and needed to be reformed. The Senate announcement of the \"PAC majority\" radio said that Telis even led the effort to pass some sort of \"stand on your land\" law that caused the death of Travon Martin. The part on which we focused is whether Florida's law \"Stop On Your Land\" killed Trevon. There are many factors that could have contributed to the shooting of George Zimmerman Travon, including racial profiling and his desire to be a law enforcement officer (not to mention the obvious: having a weapon). The law of \"stand on your ground\" could have affected the jury's decision to exonerate Zimmerman from the murder. But it is an exaggeration to say that the law is responsible for Travon's death. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07053"}
