In a social media landscape rife with claims about manufactured COVID case and death tallies, and conspiracies related to vaccines, 5G cell towers and whatever else, the clear implication is there\u2019s something nefarious going on.\n\"Nothing to see here except synchronized cases all over the world,\" said one post from June 15, 2020.\n\"Google 322 Covid! Why is 322 a magic number!?!\" screamed another post from the same day. \"How is it that an additional 322 cases of Covid have been reported in Massachusetts, South Korea, Philippines, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Equador, Thailand, Oklahoma, China, Colorado, Armenia, Oman (Middle East), Onondaga (NY), Kerala (India), Simerset (NJ), Kentucky, Wyoming, Borders (UK), Amritsar (India), Thane (India), Camden County (NJ), Iraq, Khaleej (Dubai), and Dakota County (Nebraska)!\"\n\nThat post was accompanied by 17 different photos noting the number 322 in headlines dating back to March.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nWe found at least 15 different versions of this claim scattered across Facebook, together shared thousands of times.\nThe comments on the various posts offer a smorgasbord of explanations. Some noted the \"Skull and Bones\" secret society at Yale University is also called \"Order 322.\" Others noted the numbers add up to seven, or that terrorist attacks in London and Brussels occurred on March 22 (3/22).\nSigh.\nAllow us to point out the obvious.\nYou can find this supposed connection to COVID-19 with just about any number in the low three-digit range.\n\"Connection\" only due to volume of media coverage\nWe\u2019re in the midst of a global pandemic that is unprecedented in this age of media saturation. All manner of local and regional publications have been reporting on COVID-19 case and death numbers for months.\nThere is no time in history where this many media outlets have been so focused for this long on one singular topic \u2014 particularly one in which counting stats are so critical and readily available through online searches.\nIn other words, there are a lot of media outlets posting a lot of numbers.\nAnd America really loves units of government.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the nation you\u2019ll find more than 3,000 counties. Beyond that, there are nearly 20,000 incorporated places (primarily cities, towns, villages, boroughs), about 3,000 of which have at least 10,000 people.\nAdd that to the 50 states and, well, the entire rest of the world, and you\u2019ve got a lot of places tallying COVID data that could potentially add up to 322.\nBut in case you\u2019re somehow not convinced yet, we\u2019ll follow the advice of one poster and Google this.\nWe ran a Google News search using the terms \"322 cases\" AND COVID, to find online references to where \"322 cases\" appeared as a unit on a page that also referenced COVID.\nThen we did the same with the numbers around 322. Here\u2019s what we found as of about noon on June 16, 2020.\n\n\n\"320 cases\" AND COVID \u2014 8,660 results (larger, since many reports round off the numbers)\n\n\n\"321 cases\" AND COVID \u2014 1,170 results\n\n\n\"322 cases\" AND COVID \u2014 1,960 results\n\n\n\"323 cases\" AND COVID \u2014 2,240 results\n\n\n\"324 cases\" AND COVID \u2014 1,600 results\n\n\n\"325 cases\" AND COVID \u2014 2,530 results\n\n\nWe\u2019ll spare you another set of bullets, but searches with the word \"deaths\" in place of \"cases\" yields the same type of results.\nIn other words, you can find COVID-19 media reports citing any number in that range.\nOur ruling\nAn array of Facebook posts claim a link between the number 322 and COVID-19 in media reports.\nThe implication is that there is something shady or manufactured in the way these tallies are reported.\nBut even in the context of social media in 2020, this is ridiculous.\nThe volume of media reports on COVID-19, the number of cases and the number of local and regional units of government means there is ample opportunity for tallies to add up to just about any number, particularly in the low triple digits.\nGoogle searches prove out that 322 isn\u2019t even a particularly common number.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17930"}
