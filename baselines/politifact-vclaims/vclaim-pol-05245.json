Just that vote, and you must know this, alienates most in the Republican Party, so they never would vote to confirm him.\"\nA few conservative groups and figures have already attacked Garland for his position on guns since his nomination. We\u2019re putting O\u2019Reilly\u2019s specific claim that Garland voted \"to keep guns away from private citizens\" on the Truth-O-Meter.\nD.C. gun ban\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s statement refers to a landmark case on gun rights, District of Columbia vs. Heller. In its 2008 ruling, the Supreme Court found that Washington\u2019s gun regulations \u2014 essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home \u2014 were unconstitutional.\nThis ruling was significant because it was the first time the court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual\u2019s right to own a firearm for self defense. Up until Heller, the widespread understanding of the Second Amendment was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service.\nBefore the case went to the Supreme Court, though, it appeared in the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuit, where Garland has been a judge since 1997, as Parker vs. District of Columbia. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of three D.C. Circuit judges came to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional.\nBased on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion.\nGarland didn\u2019t vote on this case at all.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the city of Washington asked the court to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the court\u2019s judges would reconsider the case, not just the panel of three. The court ended up denying the city\u2019s petition, but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who was in favor of rehearing the case.\nIt\u2019s not fair to conclude that Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider the case, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is generally used when a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case.\nD.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a well-known conservative, joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual rights, filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court asking them to send Heller back to the lower courts for consideration, noted Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School.\n\"Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law,\" Winkler said. \"Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment.\"\nWe should also note another case, which some critics say indicates that Garland has a left-leaning opinion of the Second Amendment. In 2000, he joined the majority opinion in a 2-1 finding that the FBI could hold on to gun purchase records for six months for auditing purposes, to make sure the instant background check systems worked.\nThe National Rifle Association called the six-month record retention an \"illegal national registration of gun owners,\" while the court found that it was a common-sense auditing system, not a national firearm registry, according to news reports from the time.\nOur ruling\nO\u2019Reilly said Merrick Garland \"voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens.\"\nGarland never heard the case about Washington gun laws from the bench, and so he never voted on it.\nHe voted in favor of reconsidering the case, but it\u2019s impossible to extrapolate from that vote his position on the merits of the case.\nWe rate O\u2019Reilly\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05245"}
