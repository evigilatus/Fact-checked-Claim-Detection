At the time, more than 118,000 cases of COVID-19 had been identified in over 110 countries worldwide, and the disease has continued to spread since.\nNow, more than 27 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Coronavirus Resource Center. But some social media users are still questioning the terms used to describe the disease.\n\"The CDC has removed the \u2018Covid-19 Pandemic\u2019 and replaced it with \u2018Covid-19 Outbreak\u2019 on their website,\" one Facebook post says. \"It was never a pandemic.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe post mischaracterizes the coronavirus updates on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s website homepage.\nAs early as Jan. 18, the CDC\u2019s top homepage story was about the coronavirus. \"CDC is closely monitoring an outbreak caused by a novel (new) coronavirus in Wuhan City, China,\" the story said, according to an archived version of the page.\nThe CDC was also using the term \"outbreak\" in February and March, archived pages show.\nThe CDC homepage still refers to the virus as an outbreak on its homepage.\nHowever, the use of the term \"outbreak\" doesn\u2019t mean COVID-19 is not a pandemic, as the CDC\u2019s website explains.\nThe site defines outbreak as \"a higher-\u00adthan-expected number of occurrences of disease in a specific location and time.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"An outbreak is called an epidemic when there is a sudden increase in cases. As COVID-19 began spreading in Wuhan, China, it became an epidemic,\" the website explains. \"Because the disease then spread across several countries and affected a large number of people, it was classified as a pandemic.\"\nThe CDC site uses the term \"outbreak\" to describe COVID-19 on its homepage, while \"pandemic\" is used elsewhere on the site.\nThe post also incorrectly asserts that COVID-19 was never a pandemic.\nThe World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11 and has not changed that designation.\u00a0\nThe CDC refers to COVID-19 as a pandemic on various website pages dedicated to providing coronavirus information, including the \"Global COVID-19\" page, the \"Travel during the COVID-19 Pandemic\" page and others.\nThe CDC\u2019s page about influenza pandemics, which was last updated on May 12, plainly declares: \"The United States is NOT currently experiencing an influenza pandemic. There is an ongoing pandemic with a new coronavirus.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims, \"The CDC has removed the \u2018Covid-19 Pandemic\u2019 and replaced it with \u2018Covid-19 Outbreak\u2019 on their website. It was never a pandemic.\"\nThe CDC website\u2019s homepage currently refers to the \"novel coronavirus outbreak,\" and has been using that term since January. But there is no evidence the CDC removed the word \"pandemic\" to replace it with \"outbreak.\"\u00a0\nThe World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March, and the CDC website still refers to \"the COVID-19 pandemic\" on several of its pages.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18897"}
