Obama, touting an element of his stimulus package, said that a tax cut \u201cbegan showing up in paychecks of 4.8 million Indiana households about three months ago.\u201d   That struck our reader as odd because the Census Bureau pegs Indiana\u2019s population at 6.3 million, of which one quarter are under 18. What\u2019s the likelihood that the remaining 4.8 million Indiana adults each constitute their own household?\nNot likely at all.\nWhen we asked the Indiana Department of Revenue how many tax returns are filed annually in the state, they said the number is around 3.2 million, and that includes both joint filers and individuals.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

A White House official confirmed for us that it was a goof, pure and simple. A staffer mistakenly used the number of households in Illinois in Obama's speech, 4.8 million, instead of Indiana, which is 2.4 million.\nSo there aren't as many Hoosier households as Obama claimed, and he earns a False on the Truth-O-Meter.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15652"}
