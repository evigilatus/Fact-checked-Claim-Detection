But sometimes those stories are wrong.\nTake, for example, the claim that Congress voted to give itself a pay raise in 2018 (it didn't),\u00a0or the rumor that members can retire with full pay after only one term in office (they can\u2019t).\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, a Facebook post says that while House Democrats are\u00a0requesting a pay increase, congressional salaries have gone up a whopping \"231%\" over the last 30 years.\nThe post, which includes text over a photo of the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, says:\n\"Over the past 30 years, Congressional Salaries have gone up 231% While 80% of Americans haven\u2019t even been able to keep up with Cost of Living! Now Congress is saying they need a $4,500 raise \u2026 for doing WHAT???\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe part of the claim that says \"80% of Americans\" can\u2019t keep up with the current cost of living is essentially correct. According to a 2017 Career Builder report, 78% of full-time workers in the U.S. said they live paycheck-to-paycheck to make ends meet.\nAnd while members of Congress have, indeed, gotten raises over the years, it hasn\u2019t happened since 2009. As well, the salary increases that have been approved in the last 30 years appear to add up to less than half of the 231% figure the post employs.\nFirst let\u2019s look at how congressional salaries increases work\nRequired by Article I, Section 6, the Framers of the Constitution decided that Congress would determine its own salary. In 1789, members earned $6 a day when they attended sessions. The per diem was increased to $7 for senators that same year, marking the first official congressional pay raise. After that, Congress periodically enacted specific legislation to alter its pay \u2013 until 30 years ago with the passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill established the current automatic annual adjustment formula, which is fixed to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) that measures changes in wages \u2013 meaning that the raises must be equal to increases in the ECI. Under this system, congressional pay increases are automatic each year unless Congress votes it down \u2013 which it has done since 2009 \u2013 the last year senators and representatives received a salary adjustment.\u00a0\nSo how much have congressional salaries gone up?\nAccording to a Congressional Research Service report, rank-and-file members of Congress were making $89,500 30 years ago in 1989. Today, they receive the same salary they have since 2009: $174,000. That comes to a 30-year increase of 94 percent.\n\n(Note that Congressional leadership receives higher salaries: $223,500 annually for the Speaker of the House today, and $193,400 for the Senate President pro tempore. The majority and minority leaders in both chambers also receive $193,400.)\nBill Ryan, spokesperson for the Library of Congress, confirmed to PolitiFact that, per the Congressional Research Service report we consulted, the salaries have seen a 94% increase since 1989.\nThe post is even more incorrect when you consider inflation. The $89,500 lawmakers were earning in 1989 today would be worth nearly $182,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics's inflation calculator.\nWhen it comes to the upcoming adjustment in January 2020, if the potential increase of $4,500 is approved, the projected percentage increase for the year would be 2.6%, bringing the total 30-year increase to 84 percent over the $96,000 salary members received in 1990.\nOur ruling\nA post on social media says that over the last 30 years, congressional salaries have gone up \"231% while 80% of Americans haven\u2019t even been able to keep up with Cost of Living!\"\nWhile three-quarters of full-time U.S. workers did say they live paycheck-to-paycheck, congressional salaries haven\u2019t increased since 2009, and in the last 30 years have gone up about 94%.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00354"}
