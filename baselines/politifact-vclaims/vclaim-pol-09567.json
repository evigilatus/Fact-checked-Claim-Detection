A year prior, the state had 3,325,600 private-sector jobs. That\u2019s a net loss of 115,700 jobs.\n\nJoseph J. Seneca, an economics professor with the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, agreed with that figure.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in other fact-checks about private-sector job gains and losses in New Jersey, Christie had cited a figure of 117,000.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy either measure, Christie\u2019s numbers are off a bit. One reason is that the BLS has \"benchmarked\" its numbers, according to the state Labor Department.\n\n\"Benchmarking at BLS has taken place, which is a backward look at the numbers and adjustments based on newer, fuller data,\" Labor Department spokesman Brian Murray explained in an e-mail. \"It is done annually, and the look back goes anywhere from two years to further back.\"\n\nBLS spokeswoman Stacey Standish confirmed how benchmarking works.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether Corzine really is to blame for those lost jobs.\n\nLet\u2019s point out that the first half of 2009 \u2013 Corzine\u2019s last year in office \u2013 was marked by recession.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit research group, has said the \u2018Great Recession\u2019 began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Lingering effects from the economic slowdown, however, have continued.\n\nAlso, as economic experts have told us for previous and similar rulings about private-sector job growth in New Jersey, the governor not only can\u2019t take all the credit for job gains, he can\u2019t pin blame for loss solely on another administration when there are other factors at work.\n\nChristie spokesmen Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not return a request for comment.\n\nOur ruling\n\nChristie said the year before he took office, the state lost 119,000 private-sector jobs, labeling them \"Corzine jobs losses of 2009.\"\n\nChristie is off a bit, since data from the BLS and state Labor Department show that New Jersey lost 115,700 jobs from December 2008 to 2009 \u2013 a period marked by the height of the recession, and something that economic experts have told us cannot be blamed solely on one person.\n\nSince the governor\u2019s number is off slightly and the claim implies that Corzine is to blame for those job losses, we give Christie a ruling that he\u2019s had before on these types of fact-checks: Half True.\n\nTo comment on this story go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09567"}
