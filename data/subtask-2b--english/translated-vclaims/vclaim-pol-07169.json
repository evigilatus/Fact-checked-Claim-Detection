Agriculture is the first industry in Georgia, with more than $71 billion a year pumped into the State economy. In this context, talking farms are a political account, particularly in heavy central Georgia. These maths were presented with their full glory at this week's State Fair in Perry, where the U.S. Senate hopes for a discussion for the first time. \"How do you justify to farmers that there are 17 more important items on your priority list than farmers in this state?\" (In fact, the Republicans have asked his democratic opponent. Nan appeared to have confused the matter and described the allegation as incorrect. \"There's no plan that has that list,\" Nan said. In view of the fact that the winner of the race would replace Mr. Saxby Champles, a former agricultural lawyer who had spent his career in Congress on agriculture committees, Poletti Fakt Georgia decided to look at the facts behind the political scene. First, some background. Nun and Birdo are both political novices demanding some claim to the countryside in Georgia. Nan spent the first six years of her life in Perry before her father was elected to the United States Senate. The family still owns a farm in the area. Central Georgia is also a citizen of Central Georgia. An announcement showing his cousin Goff's ex. Sonny Birdo, speaking of that background, spent the young men \"picking up the melons.\" The candidates met with the influential Georgian Farm Office, which does not support the candidates. Both said that they would be looking for seats on the Senate Agriculture Committee if elected. Pido's television ads have always shown that he's wearing a jacket, and he's walking in a country field. Its programme includes reducing the systems faced by farmers to help increase production. \"I hope to bring in new ideas that will help ease burdensome restrictions and ensure the success of our local farmers in the strong development of Georgia,\" said Birdo in a press release in August. Pedor &apos; s criticism of N'Agricultural Certificates is based on two of the 144 pages of N &apos; s campaign memoirs issued in December 2013 and leaked this summer. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook that says that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"requiring him to stick to the proven book of democratic play.\" By Sierra Aurourke on January 11, 2021, starting on page 61, there are many political issues that require background notes for the candidate and her staff to review. Agriculture ranked 18, in order of delivery, after various issues such as the budget and detention camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. \"It is quite clear that how they put agriculture on their list of priorities should be discussed,\" said spokesman Birdo Derek Dickie. However, the note appears to contradict this interpretation. The document bears the word \"agricultural,\" a sign from the authors that the policy paper on this issue has either been completed or is nearing completion. Policy papers on issues that rank higher in the memorandum, such as the budget, are not bold and are therefore still being prepared. Nathan Nikle, spokesman for Nun, said that this was because the issues were not listed in order of importance but rather as subjects that the advisers wanted to address. She said that Nan made her commitment to agriculture clear when, within a week of her nomination in July 2013, she told the reporters that her goal was to serve in the Senate Agrarian and Armed Services Committees. Her father, Sam Nan, was Chairman of the 24-year Senate Armed Service Commission. The seven-page Nan Action Plan includes an invitation to expand partnerships between government universities and farmers among other priorities such as tax reform. \"My family has a third-generation farm in Perry, and we've grown and raised everything from groceries to peppers to pigs -- if you count our ranch pig, Mayblin,\" Nan said during a visit to Georgia's farm office in February. \"I understand how important our agricultural society is to our economy and our heritage as Georgians.\" So where does that leave us? It is true that agriculture is listed in 18 of the 22 policy notes that need to be updated, in accordance with the leaked internal electoral campaign documents. However, there is no evidence to support the idea that the list is an arrangement of Nan &apos; s priorities. The Piedward statement ignores critical facts and is misleading in his face. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07169"}
