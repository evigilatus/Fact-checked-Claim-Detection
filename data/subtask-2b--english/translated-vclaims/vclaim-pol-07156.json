The Farming Bill 2014, a bi-party effort that ended direct payments to farmers, strengthened crop insurance and reduced philatelic financing, is under consideration. Michel Nun, a democratic candidate for the open Senate of Georgia, invoked her support for the bill in her first discussion this week with Republican candidate David Birdo. Saxby Champles, Johnny Isaacson, said that the farm bill was the most important legislation of the Georgians, but still stood against it, Nan said. Since agriculture injects $71 billion into the State economy each year, making it the largest industry in the State, it implies that lack of support for farmers constitutes a dangerous business. But is that true? Paulette Fakt Georgia has decided to verify. The N's claim is aimed at strengthening their bipartisan goodwill - and the show is consistent with conservatives such as Georgia's two current senators, Saxby Champles, Johnny Isaacson, and powerful groups, such as Georgia and the United States farm offices. Both Birdo and Nan said they wanted to work on the Senate Committee on Agriculture. Her claim is based on statements made by Birdo in February, while he was running at the crowded GOP primary school. Of the seven Republicans running, only the American Republic Jack Kingston, R-Savannah, said he supported the farm bill. At the time of that debate, Nan had already expressed support for this measure, which took more than two years, as well as her intention to seek a seat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, her spokesperson, Nathan Klick, said. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" One of the legislative priorities of Georgian farmers -- Michelle Nun said from the beginning of this campaign that fighting for Georgian farmers is one of its top priorities, \"He said click. The draft law on farms has been endorsed by legislators from various political groups, largely because of the importance of agriculture in different states. Yitzhakun and Chambels supported the final bill, and Chambels took the floor in the Senate to urge others to vote with him. \"There is no single legislation affecting a number of people in my state like this,\" said Champles, a former agricultural lawyer. The opposition came mostly from the far left and extreme right of each party. The Democrats who voted against the bill complained that food stamps had been reduced by some $8.6 billion over a decade, officially known as the Supplementary Food Assistance Programme or the South Pacific National Action Programme. Republican opponents claimed that these cuts did not go far enough. The spokesman for Derek Dickie said that he was on one side of the opposition of the General Democratic Party. It is believed that Congress missed an opportunity to reform the wider food stamp program. \"We've seen a dramatic growth in food stamps over the years,\" said Dickie. David supports a debate that focuses on getting these people back to work, separate from protection from farmers. This type of debate requires a fragmented draft law on financing agriculture and nutrition. An attempt to do so failed in Congress before legislators gathered behind compromise. In spite of that date, Nan is clearly right to say that Birdo did not support the Farming Bill 2014. However, it is exaggerated that opposition to the draft law translates into opposition to farmers or agriculture. We assess her claim mostly correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07156"}
