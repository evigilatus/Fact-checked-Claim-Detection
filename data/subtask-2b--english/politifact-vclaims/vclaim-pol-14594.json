(Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.)\n\n\"Taxin\u2019 Kathryn,\" says the mailer sent in early August 2010. \"With Kathryn Starkey\u2019s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?\"\n\nWe wondered, can you trust the mailer\u2019s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item examines her actions and stance on the Penny for Pasco sales tax. Other items are here on her attendance at river board meetings and here on her actions involving votes on river board tax rates.\n\nThe tax hike in question is the Penny for Pasco sales tax, a one-cent-on-the-dollar county sales tax increase to build new schools and roads, preserve land and buy public safety equipment. About 52 percent of voters approved the tax in March 2004. By the end of 2009, the extra penny had pulled in about $205 million.\n\nThe claim that Starkey \"joined forces with liberal Democrats\" to pass the tax has problems.\n\nFirst, Starkey played no strong public role in selling the tax to voters. She publicly endorsed the Penny for Pasco during her successful 2004 campaign for School Board, but she never actively campaigned for it or joined the committee promoting it.\n\nSecond, where were the liberal Democrats? Pasco\u2019s Citizen Committee, the political action committee that formed to promote the tax, had 14 key volunteers: 10 of them were registered Republicans, the Pasco Times reported then.\n\nThey included well-known Republicans Allen Altman, Joanne Hurley, Thad Lowery and Bill Phillips.\n\nTrue, the tax got the endorsement of Pasco\u2019s Democratic Executive Committee and not that of the county\u2019s Republican Executive Committee.\n\nBut consider, too, the prominent Republican politicians who publicly supported the tax: Commissioners Ted Schrader, Ann Hildebrand and Pat Mulieri and then-commissioner Steve Simon, along with then-state representatives Ken Littlefield and Heather Fiorentino.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget Pasco Sheriff Bob White, another Republican, who was quoted in the Pasco Times calling support of the tax a \"no-brainer.\"\n\nWhite said then that his remarks were aimed primarily at how the tax would help the school district, but his endorsement \u2014 however nuanced \u2014 was political gold for the tax\u2019s backers.\n\nOne big selling point for Republicans: The sales tax would result in a property tax reduction on the school district side. (Incidentally, that is not unlike Corcoran\u2019s platform in the House 45 campaign to eliminate property taxes and increase the sales tax.)\n\nTo be sure, there were Democrats who were very involved in the effort. They included Land O\u2019Lakes lawyer Tim Hayes and, most visibly, Ray Gadd, who led the school system\u2019s effort as a Pasco school district administrator at the time. Then-commissioner Peter Altman, a Democrat, was also a vocal supporter.\n\n\"I can\u2019t think of a liberal Democrat who was involved,\" said Gadd, who, incidentally, has changed his affiliation to independent.\n\nThe strongest opponents of the tax included Republicans Bill and Ann Bunting, leaders in the local party. But even they acknowledge that they were more often fighting people with Rs, not Ds, after their names.\n\n\"I can\u2019t for the life of me understand how those Republicans supported it,\" said Ann Bunting.\nPennington, Corcoran\u2019s consultant, said he linked Starkey with the Penny leaders because her endorsement as a School Board candidate carried weight. He said he also thought Allen Altman, who helped spearhead the campaign, was a Democrat. (Wrong.)\n\nCorcoran was equally mistaken that the tax was a strongly Democratic initiative. \"It was overwhelmingly pushed by Democratic leaders,\" he said. (He was also unaware that White \u2014 whom he now works for as a contract attorney \u2014 endorsed the Penny.)\n\nA new tax may be often associated with \"liberal Democrats,\" but that wasn\u2019t the case with Penny for Pasco, particularly when it came to those who were publicly pushing for it. In addition, Starkey was not a key promoter of the tax.\n\nWe rate this claim False.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
