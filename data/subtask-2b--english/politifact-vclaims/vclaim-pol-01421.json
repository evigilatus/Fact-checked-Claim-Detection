Trump said they did at a rally in Lebanon, Ohio, on Oct. 12.\nHe said, \"I'll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress \u2014 thanks to (Ohio Republican Sen.) Rob Portman and a lot of others \u2014 thank you, Rob \u2014 but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support.\"\nWas this a mostly Republican-backed bill?\nNot at all.

After the chambers ironed out their differences, the final version passed the House 393-8 on Sept. 28 and the Senate 98-1 on Oct. 3. (The only vote against the bill in the Senate \u2014\u00a0on both versions \u2014\u00a0was by a Republican, Mike Lee of Utah.)\nThe bill then went to the president, but he hasn\u2019t officially signed it yet.
