But that isn't substantiated at all.\n\"Lisa Page squeals: DNC server was not hacked by Russians,\" said the July 17 headline by Your News Wire which frequently publishes fake news.\nThis story was flagged as part Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no credible evidence to back up the headline.\nYour News Wire largely drew from a story by The True Pundit about Page\u2019s closed-door House hearings on July 13 and July 16. The True Pundit said the information came from \"federal sources\" and \"well-placed FBI sources.\"\nThe True Pundit said that Page alleged that the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed \"assets\" had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s 30,000 \"missing\" emails.\nIn 2016, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that the Russian government directed the recent theft of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite that, Trump has questioned whether the Russian government tried to interfere in the U.S. election. In 2016, Trump said it could have been China who hacked emails of Democratic operatives and the Democratic National Committee. Or someone \"sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\"\nPage, a former FBI lawyer, has drawn attention from lawmakers because she and former FBI agent Peter Strzok exchanged anti-Trump text messages while having an affair. Both worked on the FBI's Russia investigation and for a brief time on Special Counsel Robert\u2019s Mueller\u2019s investigation. Strozak testified publicly for 10 hours on July 12.\nWe don\u2019t have access to Page\u2019s testimony because it occurred in a closed-door session. News reports said Page didn\u2019t answer reporters\u2019 questions before or after her testimony and lawmakers revealed little. However, of the information that has emerged about her testimony and reported by the mainstream media, none of it indicated she blamed the Chinese.\nConservative news outlets included Breitbart and The Daily Caller said that lawmakers indicated Page contradicted Strzok about their texts and focused on the issue of political bias at the FBI, but those articles didn\u2019t indicate that she blamed China, either.\nThe Washington Post reported that Republican lawyers said that Page provided new information that further convinced them that political bias marred the investigations of Hillary Clinton's emails and the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia. Page denied bias.\nSeveral right-wing websites have repeated the claim that Page contradicted the U.S. intelligence community and pointed the finger at China. We sent an email to Your News Wire and did not get a reply.\nPolitiFact evaluates information using on-the-record sources and information as of the time that a person or website makes a claim. At the time of this fact-check, we found no on-the-record credible information that Page blamed the hacking on the Chinese.
