(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere is no evidence that the Biden administration has labeled members of the Libertarian Party or people with libertarian views terrorists.\u00a0\nWhile Biden referred to the rioters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 as \"domestic terrorists,\" he did not single out libertarians in the roughly 20-minute speech he delivered Jan. 7.\u00a0\nIn his inaugural address, Biden singled out domestic terrorism and white surpremacy as threats the nation \"must confront\" and \"defeat.\" He did not mention libertarians in that address or insinuate libertarians were terrorists.\nCohen told PolitiFact that he based his post \u2014 which he described as \"pretty tongue-in-cheek\" \u2014 on a statement made by former CIA director John Brennan during an MSNBC interview.\u00a0\nCohen claimed that Brennan, who served under President Barack Obama, said the new administration would be investigating domestic terrorists \u2014 including Libertarians.\nIn another Facebook post, Cohen referred to the MSNBC video more directly.\u00a0\n\"It's been less than 24 hours into the new administration, and the former head of the CIA is already on national TV saying that the Biden administration will move with \u2018laser-like focus\u2019 on... libertarians,\" Cohen wrote.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the video does not substantiate what Cohen claimed.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what Brennan said:\u00a0\n\"I know looking forward that the members of the Biden team, who have been nominated or have been appointed, are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we\u2019ve seen overseas. Where they germinate in different parts of the country, and they gain strength, and it brings together an unholy alliance, frequently, of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, nativists \u2014\u00a0even libertarians.\"\u00a0\nBrennan did not say the Biden administration would target libertarians. Brennan does not hold a position within the Biden administration.\nNick Shapiro, former deputy chief of staff to Brennan at the CIA, told PolitiFact that Brennan's comments in the interview referred\u00a0to government efforts to find and charge people involved in the attack on\u00a0the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. \"He said 'even libertarians,'\u00a0since many self-identified libertarians acknowledged their participation in the disgraceful events of 6 January. He was not referring to the Libertarian Party,\" Shapiro said.\nCohen told PolitiFact that he did not have any proof that Biden himself had labeled Libertarians terrorists.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nCohen claimed the Biden administration labeled Libertarians \"terrorists.\"\u00a0\nThere is no evidence of this. The claim was based on a misinterpretation of a statement made by a former CIA director who holds no official position in the Biden administration.\nWe rate this claim False.\nUPDATED, Jan. 22, 7:26 p.m.: This article was updated to include comment from a spokesperson for Brennan.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19213"}
