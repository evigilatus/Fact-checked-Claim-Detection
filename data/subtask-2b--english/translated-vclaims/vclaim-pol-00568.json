This was the case with a democratic comment made by Kirsten Gillibrand from New York during the month of her presidential campaign. The Facebook virus misrepresents Gilibrand's words, claiming that illegal immigrants should receive social security benefits without being paid in the system. She then said: \"Social security must be extended to illegal immigration, which is their right.\" Under the alleged quotation, the text reads: \"Why do older social security persons have to pay for medical care and supplementary insurance, yet the illegal gets it all free of charge?\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This allegation takes the words of Gilbert out of context. What I have suggested is that migrants have a \"right\" to pay taxes, social security and local school systems and that access to citizenship should be provided. On March 19, 2019, the campaign in Davenport, Iowa, discussed a variety of issues, and at some point, a woman in the crowd asked, \"Will you talk a little bit about immigration... what have you done, and what do you see, on a large scale, both dreamers, prisoners for profit, separated children and asylum-seekers?\" It took Gilbrand a few minutes to respond and eventually said (about 19:45 in a live video of the event on Facebook): \"First, we need comprehensive immigration reform. If you are in this country now, you must have the right to pay for social security, to pay your taxes, to pay in the local school system It has to happen.\" Soon after she made those comments, former Arkansas Goff. Mike Hakapi, Governor, appeared on the Sean Hannetti Fox News program and misdescribed her words. \"If someone comes here illegally... let's not just give them grandma's social security, let's throw in a car,\" said Hakapi. \"I hope Kristin Gillibrand has to go out and talk to people in the '70s who can barely afford food and tell them they won't get their own social security. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 On January 16, 2012, this was not the only circulation in Gilbert's remarks. Other outlets, such as Britbart and Washington, have also published an explanation that Gilbrand suggested that undocumented migrants should receive social security benefits without contributing to them. It didn't take long for the claim to appear on social media. However, as analysed in the Los Angeles Times, Gilbrand did not call for the benefits of the programme to be abandoned, but for migrants, regardless of their status, to be allowed to pay these benefits publicly, through salaries and income taxes, and to receive the benefits they had earned. According to the analysis, many undocumented migrants are already paid into the system without receiving any benefits. According to the Social Security Department report 2013, 1.8 million undocumented migrants (the report uses the term \"unlicensed\" migrants) were working and contributing to social security in 2010 using the social security figure that was either fabricated or belonged to another person. The report does not cover visa holders and others. It is estimated that a total of 3.1 million undocumented migrants were working and paying social security taxes that year. \"while unauthorized migrants were working and contributing up to $13 billion in salary taxes to the Institute's programme in 2010, only about $1 billion of benefit payments during 2010 were due to unauthorized work,\" the report states. \"Thus, we estimate that the income of unauthorized migrants has a net positive impact on the overall financial position of social security, and that this impact has contributed about $12 billion to the cash flow of the programme for 2010. * Meredith Kelly, spokesperson for the Gilbrand Campaign, was told that the words of Politifakt Gilbrand were being mischaracterized. \"Sen Gillibrand simply made a factual statement: undocumented migrants do pay for social security and income taxes, but do not receive any of the benefits they may receive as citizens,\" Kelly wrote in an e-mail. \"As part of its comprehensive migration reform plan, they will have a way of obtaining their citizenship and the benefits they already pay. This is deliberately misleading information that has already been disclosed.\" Gillibrand says: \"Social security must be extended to cover illegal immigration, which is their right,\" indicating that migrants should receive such benefits free of charge. However, Gillibrand did not call for the benefits of the programme to be abandoned. She believed that migrants living in the United States had the right to pay in programmes such as social security and a path to citizenship.
