Malkin praised Bishop for his commitment to the conservative agenda and suggested that other Republicans had gone astray. She said, \"It was a previous North Carolina governor who was a Republican who shepherded in driver's licenses for illegal aliens in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\"\nMalkin is a political blogger, commentator, and author whose work focuses on immigration and corruption. She appeared on the show to discuss her new book, \"Open Borders Inc.: Who's Funding America's Destruction?\"\u00a0\nHer claim seemed fishy to us for a few reasons. First, the state didn\u2019t have a Republican governor until over a decade after 9/11. Also, North Carolina isn\u2019t among the 14 states and territories that allow immigrants living in the country illegally to get a driver\u2019s license. There\u2019s actually a bill in the General Assembly to do this, but it hasn\u2019t passed.\nSo, we decided to look into her claim and found there was little to support it.\u00a0\nWe assume she was talking about former Governor Pat McCrory, because he was the only Republican to hold the office since 9/11. During his term, DACA recipients became eligible for driver\u2019s licenses. However, McCrory opposed allowing immigrants living in the country illegally to get drivers\u2019 licenses. It\u2019s quite a stretch for Malkin to say he \"shepherded in\" those privileges.\nLimitations on driver\u2019s licenses for immigrants in NC\nThirteen states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to make immigrants living in the country illegally eligible for driver\u2019s licenses, according to a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures in July 2019. North Carolina is not one of them.\nThat wasn\u2019t always the case. In the 1990s and early 2000s, those immigrants could get driver\u2019s licenses in North Carolina. In a New York Times article from August 2001, Wayne Hurder, the state\u2019s director of driver\u2019s license certification, explained the reasoning behind the policy.\n''We think it's in the best interests of everyone in the state if we can get them to learn the laws of the road and get insurance. It's not our job to get into national immigration policy \u2014 this is a purely practical decision,\" Hurder said at the time.\u00a0\nBut in response to 9/11, Congress launched several efforts to strengthen domestic security. The REAL ID Act of 2005 mandated states to require proof of citizenship for REAL ID driver\u2019s licenses and identification cards. REAL IDs are required by federal agencies for people who want to access federal facilities, board federally-regulated airplanes, and enter nuclear power plants. The law is being phased in with a final deadline in October 2020.\nIn 2005, then-Governor Mike Easley, a Democrat, followed the mandate and signed a law that specified driver\u2019s license applicants must provide a valid Social Security Number, which prevented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from getting licenses. Before then, applicants could provide an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number instead.\u00a0\nIn recent years, a group of Democratic state representatives have been pushing another bill called the Safer Roads and Communities Act. It also would enable those immigrants to get licenses. The bill\u2019s supporters argue that if more drivers are trained and insured, roads will be safer for everyone.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDACA recipients are eligible\u00a0\nWe reached out to Malkin about her claim but did not hear back. It seems likely that she was referring to a policy change in 2013 to allow immigrants who qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to get North Carolina driver\u2019s licenses. (They are a small subset of the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, accounting for about 15%.)\nPat McCrory, who is the only Republican governor since 9/11, was in office at the time. Neither the REAL ID Act of 2005 nor the recent bills in the General Assembly were in play during his term.\nDACA was a program established under President Barack Obama that would defer deportation for \"Dreamers\" \u2014 young immigrants who illegally entered the United States as children \u2014 who met certain criteria. Immigrants with the new status could apply for a Social Security card and legally work in the United States.\nBut the North Carolina DMV wasn\u2019t sure how to handle driver\u2019s license applications from DACA recipients and asked the attorney general\u2019s office to weigh in. In January 2013, then Attorney General Roy Cooper released a legal opinion that said DACA recipients were entitled to driver\u2019s licenses.\nWhen we asked McCrory about the policy, he emphasized that the driver\u2019s licenses issued to DACA recipients included the phrases \"Legal Presence\" and \"No Lawful Status.\" The former governor said, \"We were following the law reluctantly.\"\nMcCrory also told us that he opposed expanding driver\u2019s license eligibility to immigrants living here illegally. When a 2015 bill was introduced that proposed to do just that, McCrory\u2019s legislative liaison told lawmakers, \"He is concerned with the provision providing driving privileges to those who are in this country unlawfully.\"\nOur ruling\nMichelle Malkin said former Republican Governor Pat McCrory \"shepherded in driver\u2019s licenses for illegal aliens in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\"\nFor the most part, her claim isn\u2019t supported by the facts.\nNorth Carolina hasn\u2019t allowed unauthorized immigrants to get driver\u2019s licenses since 2006, when a Democratic governor signed an act requiring driver\u2019s license applicants to provide a valid Social Security Number. We found widely varying estimates on the number of people living in North Carolina illegally who are currently ineligible for driver\u2019s licenses.\nAlthough North Carolina decided to allow DACA recipients to access driver\u2019s licenses during McCrory\u2019s tenure as governor, he said he followed that \"reluctantly\" and did not support making the larger population of immigrants living here illegally eligible for driver\u2019s licenses.\u00a0\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.\nEditor's note: This item has been updated with comments from former Gov.
