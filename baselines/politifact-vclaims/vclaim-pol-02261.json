Bloggers spread misinformation", "text": "Multiple internet bloggers falsely claimed that student David Hogg was not on the campus of \u00a0Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when the school shooting happened Feb. 14.\nThe inaccurate claims surfaced after CBS News produced \"39 Days,\" a documentary of several Stoneman Douglas High School students including Hogg. At the beginning of the video, Hogg, described as a student journalist, explained his immediate actions following the shooting that left 17 people dead.\nSome bloggers took the 14-second soundbite to insinuate that Hogg wasn\u2019t actually at school when the shooting took place.\n\"In a recently leaked excerpt of a CBS documentary, David Hogg admits he was at home during the Parkland shooting,\" reads the opening of a story on Squawker.org.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-27 16:42:09 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says David Hogg wasn\u2019t at school during the Parkland school shooting.    Internet rumors posts on the Internet https://truthunsealed.com/conspiracy/bombshell-marjory-douglas-student-leader-david-hogg-wasnt-at-school-on-day-of-the-mass-shooting/   blogs Monday, March 26, 2018 2018-03-26    Read More  info    \n\n\"David Hogg admits he wasn\u2019t at school during Parkland school shooting,\" says a headline on DailyPresser.com.\nNone of those claims are true.\nThe inaccurate posts say that Hogg\u2019s comments directly contradict statements in a Feb. 15 Time Magazine interview. Hogg said he heard a gunshot while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m.\nThe blogs juxtaposed that statement with the following statement from Hogg in the CBS documentary: \"On the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting.\"\nPeople questioned how Hogg could be at school when the shooting started and also be riding his bike three miles to get his camera. And if Hogg really did leave school; how did he get back on to campus if the area was on lockdown?\nThe timeline presented in this way is a bit confusing, but the blogs didn\u2019t try to fairly settle the seeming discrepancy.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Daily News 24\n\n\nstated on July 28, 2017 in a headline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Debbie Wasserman Schultz \"going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 August 2, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what happened.\nHogg was at the school during the shooting. Hogg shot a video on his cellphone while taking cover in a classroom closet.\n\nSometime after that, he went home.\nAt around 6 p.m., Hogg went back to get interviews, according to Vox.\n\"The evening after the shooting, Hogg says, he biked up to the school, where the media was still camped out,\" the article says. \"This time, he put himself in front of the camera, making his first \u2014 but not final \u2014 plea for an end to mass shootings.\"\nRegardless of this information, other conservative news websites including InfoWars and RedState jumped the gun and reported that the CBS interview \"cast doubt\" on Hogg\u2019s whereabouts during the school shooting.\nSometime after the original stories, both websites issued \"updates\" on their stories to say that the CBS video included Hogg\u2019s quote without context.\nBut not every site did.\n\"It appears that the problem was that CBS included a very confusing quote without context,\" wrote conservative Florida writer \u00a0Sarah Rumpf, author of the errant RedState story. \"Hogg was on campus during the shooting and returned several hours later to interview people across the street.\"\nClaims that Hogg was not at school during the shooting are not based in reality.
