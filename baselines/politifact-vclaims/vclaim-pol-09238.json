Bob Gibbs says 30 million will be left uninsured after Obamacare takes full effect", "text": "On May 16, the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives held its 37th vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act that was enacted in 2010. Because the U.S. Senate is controlled by Democrats, the House had no real chance to repeal the law. As the Washington Post reported that day, its main purpose was to give Republicans a platform to bring up their objections to the law they call \"Obamacare.\"\n\n\nHolmes County Republican Rep. Bob Gibbs was eager to take advantage of that opportunity. Before the vote, he delivered a House of Representatives floor speech in which he described the law as \"detrimental to all Americans\" and said that if the U.S. Senate \"really wants to pass a jobs bill, then they should listen to the American people and support repeal and replace.\"\n\n\nThe next day, Gibbs used his Twitter account to decry the law further. \"If #Obamacare is fully implemented, 30 million people will still be without health insurance,\" Gibbs tweeted.\n\n\nWe decided to check out Gibbs\u2019 claim that so many people would still be without health insurance after the bill is fully implemented. Although Gibbs\u2019 office did not respond to requests to document his information, we found a Congressional Budget Office analysis released three days before Gibbs\u2019 remark that stated: \u00a0\"In our current projections for 2023, the ACA reduces the number of people without health insurance by 25 million, leaving 31 million uninsured (compared with 30 million in our February estimate).\" That\u2019s close to the number that Gibbs provided.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA widely circulated CBO report from last summer said the \"ACA, in comparison with prior law before the enactment of the ACA, will reduce the number of nonelderly people without health insurance coverage by 14 million in 2014 and by 29 million or 30 million in the latter part of the coming decade, leaving 30 million nonelderly residents uninsured by the end of the period.\"\n\n\nGibbs\u2019 statement that 30 million people will be uninsured after the health care law\u2019s full implementation is close to the CBO\u2019s latest estimate, but it ignores a key fact: the number of people without insurance would be much higher without the law. In the next 10 years, 25 million nonelderly people who don\u2019t have insurance now would gain insurance under the bill. That\u2019s important context that Gibbs overlooks in his tweet. According to CBO, the insurance rate for the nation\u2019s non-elderly residents is predicted to rise from 80 percent this year to 90 percent in 2023.\n\n\nWhile Gibbs is right that many people will not have insurance after the law is implemented, his statement fails to acknowledge that it will enable millions of people to get insurance.
