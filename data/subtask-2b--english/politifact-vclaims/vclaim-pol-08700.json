He cited a Sept. 4 editorial in The Washington Post criticizing Cuccinelli\u2019s support of a 2007 bill in the General Assembly that would have extended to human embryos a \"right to the enjoyment of life\" from the moment of fertilization.\nThe editorial said the failed legislation would have \"provided an opening to prohibit common methods of birth control, including the pill and intrauterine devices.\"\nThe Post editorial, however, made no claim that every form of birth control -- including condoms and spermicides -- would have been banned under the bill.\nDebate over the impact of legislation that confers personhood from the moment of conception centers on how various forms of birth control work. No one disputes that devices that merely prevent fertilization wouldn\u2019t be affected by personhood laws.\nThe issue is that some forms -- including the intrauterine device, emergency contraception and birth control pills -- may also work by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. Some people say those methods go beyond mere contraception and are tantamount to causing an abortion.\nIn 2012, as Virginia was debating another personhood measure, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a statement saying laws that bestow rights from the moment of fertilization would restrict contraception choices.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group wrote, \"some of the most effective and reliable forms of contraception, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,, and other forms of FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives could be banned in states that adopt \u2018personhood\u2019 measures.\"\nBut the organization\u2019s statement, which was cited in editorial NextGen references, never said all forms of contraception would be banned. It said personhood laws would leave \"condoms, natural family planning and spermicides the only legally allowed forms of birth control.\"\nIn a September Truth-O-Meter, we gave a Half True to Cuccinelli\u2019s statement that he\u2019s never supported legislation that invades contraceptive choices. We noted that while the personhood bills he\u2019s backed never explicitly sought to ban birth control, they could have opened legal avenues to challenge certain forms of contraception.\nCuccinelli has repeatedly said he would not seek to restrict contraception. We asked his campaign how he defines birth control but did not receive a clear response. As a state senator in 2003, Cuccinelli voted against a bill that would have specified that contraception that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg is not an abortion.\nOur ruling\nNextGen Climate Action Committee says Cuccinelli wants to \"eliminate all forms of birth control.\"\nThe group cites an editorial that said personhood legislation Cuccinelli supported could have fostered legal challenges to types of contraception that prevent the implantation of fertilized eggs. But the editorial made no assertion Cuccinelli wants to ban all birth control devices.\nCuccinelli has repeatedly said he has no interest in restricting contraception, which generally works by preventing ovulation or the fertilization of a human egg.\nNextGen doesn\u2019t have a speck of proof to bolster its incendiary claim that Cuccinelli wants to ban all forms of birth control -- even condoms and spermicides. We rate it Pants of Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08700"}
