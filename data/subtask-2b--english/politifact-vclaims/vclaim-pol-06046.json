Upon reconsideration, we are changing our ruling to Half True. The text of the fact-check is unchanged.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Jim Webb says the U.S. needs a leaner, more efficient tax code.\nThe former Virginia senator broadly calls for lowering tax rates in exchange for eliminating \"loopholes and exceptions\" that he says \"have made a mockery out of true economic fairness.\" Webb says investment income should be taxed at the same rates as wages. And he would like to see the U.S. shift some of its burden away from income and toward consumption.\nBig changes? Sure. But Webb says the tax code is not sacrosanct.\n\"We did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913,\" he wrote on his campaign website.\nOur radar beeped. Somewhere in the course of our lives, we recalled reading or hearing that the income tax had deeper roots in U.S. history than Webb claimed. So we investigated.\nIn 1913, the year Webb cites, the U.S. began a tax on individual incomes, and a levy on personal earnings has been exacted ever since. That was the birth year of the 1040 tax form that, with many modifications, remains in use today. It came with one page of instructions back then, compared with 104 pages this year.\nAlthough the form was new, oldtimers in 1913 might have remembered another era when they paid income tax to Washington.\nIn 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed a measure enacting an income tax to help pay for the Civil War. It imposed a tax of 3 percent on incomes between $600 and $10,000 and a 5 percent tax on incomes above that level. The levy, which had sunset provisions, expired in 1872. It was not forgotten, however.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1894, Congress passed a new income tax, but it never went into effect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional the next year because it was a direct tax that was not apportioned on the basis of each state\u2019s population. At that time, for example, if 5 percent of the U.S. population lived in Virginia, then no more than 5 percent of the total revenue could come from Virginia.\nThat constitutional hurdle was cleared by the 16th Amendment, proposed by President William Howard Taft in 1909 and ratified by the states in 1913. It allowed the tax to be levied without any apportionment among states. Congress adopted a 1 percent tax on net personal income of more than $3,000 with a surtax of 6 percent on incomes of more than $500,000.\nBy 1918, with World War I raging, the top income bracket soared to a 77 percent tax rate.\nWe ran Webb\u2019s statement past Joseph Thorndike, the director of the online Tax History Museum -- a nonprofit organization based in Falls Church. Thorndike, also an adjunct professor of tax policy at Northwestern University, said Webb\u2019s historical oversight merits a minor penalty. \"I think it\u2019s fair to treat the Civil War tax as an anomaly,\" he said.\nWonder where the U.S. got its revenues prior to the income tax?\nBefore the Civil War, government funds primarily came from custom duties, selling public land and temporary excise taxes, according to the Congressional Research Service report. During the decades after the Civil War, when the income tax lapsed, the IRS says about 90 percent of the country\u2019s revenues came from taxes on liquor, beer, wine and tobacco.\nOur ruling\nWebb said \"we did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913.\"\nThe modern income tax structure, complete with Form 1040, was born in 1913. But his claim disregards two pre-1913 efforts to impose an income tax \u2014 one of which was in place for a decade. This claim rates Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06046"}
