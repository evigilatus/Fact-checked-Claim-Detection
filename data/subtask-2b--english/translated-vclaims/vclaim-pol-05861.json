Clinton announced last week that she no longer supports the international trade deal, despite her support while serving as Secretary of State -- once called it the \"golden scale.\" The CNN anchor and moderator Anderson Cooper picked up those words and asked Clinton to reverse them in the October debate in Las Vegas. \"I said, when I was Foreign Minister, three years ago, that I wish it was the gold standard,\" said Clinton. \"I finally negotiated it last week, and when I looked at it, it did not meet my criteria. My criteria for more good new jobs for Americans, to raise wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, \"This will help you raise your wages.\" And I concluded that I can't.\" Clinton's formulation -- she said \"I hoped it would be the gold standard\" -- means she didn't decide on TPP. However, this does not fully correspond to its previous comments. We found that her earlier observations gave the impression that she trusted the deal as it is. In Australia in 2012, Clinton made remarks on the overall theme of the relationship between the United States and Australia. Here's all she said about TPP in that address, with \"standard gold\" hanging in bold. \"It is therefore fair to say that our economies are intertwined, and we need to continue to strengthen our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Australia is a very important partner. This programme defines the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent and fair trade, and the type of environment in which the rule of law and equality of opportunity prevail. When negotiated, this convention will cover 40 per cent of the world &apos; s total trade and build strong labour and environmental protection.\" So Clinton seems to say that TPP does, definitely sets the gold standard -- unlike Clinton in the hope that it does. In other words, at about the same time, I have expressed a similar assertion that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will meet a high standard. In her remarks in Singapore in November 2012, she encouraged all States \"wanting to meet the standards of the twenty-first century as embodied in the Trans-Pacific Partnership\" to join the package. \"The so-called Trans-Pacific Partnership will reduce barriers, raise standards and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 per cent of the world &apos; s total trade and create strong protection for workers and the environment. Improving higher-wage employment and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others who were often excluded from the formal economy, would help build the middle class in Asia and restore balance to the global economy. Canada and Mexico have already joined the original partners of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We continue to consult with Japan. We offer assistance in capacity-building, so that every country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) can eventually join it. We welcome the interest of any State willing to meet the standards of the twenty-first century as embodied in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, including China.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman, January 11, 2021, here are some of the other words that Clinton used to describe TPP before leaving the State Department in 2013: \"Sexy,\" \"Innovator,\" \"Hot,\" \"Trash,\" \"Evolved,\" \"Senior\" and \"Senior.\" (For more complete comments, see our previous article on this subject.) The Clinton presidential candidate also used more hedging language, for example, saying she had \"some concerns,\" and now she explicitly said she did not support the deal as it stood. In its 2014 memoirs, she wrote: \"Because the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations are still under way, it is logical to retain the provision until we can assess the proposed final agreement. It is safe to say that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will not be perfect -- there will be no negotiated deal between twelve countries -- but its highest standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers.\" For Clinton's sake, the Turkish Postal Party is still under negotiation when Clinton made the \"standard gold\" comment. The partners just finished the deal this year. It is quite possible that the deal seems to be very different from what it was in the early stages of negotiations, when Clinton was in the Foreign Office -- what Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out in this fact check. The negotiations took place secretly, so it's hard for us to evaluate it ourselves. Also, as Secretary of State, I spoke as a representative of the Obama administration, who was and continues to wholeheartedly support the deal. Our referee (Clinton) said, when the Secretary of State was, she kept the ruling, but \"The hope of a Trans-Pacific Partnership will be the gold standard.\" She's playing her notes in 2012 a little bit. Clinton said, \"This TPP sets out the gold standard in trade agreements,\" which is a more reliable requirement than it would have said \"I hoped\" that it would meet that standard. This contrasts with the recent comments by Clinton that they have concerns about the Agreement and that they ultimately oppose it. The statement distorts its previous comments.
