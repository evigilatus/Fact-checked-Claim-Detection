John Cornyn accused a group of Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee of failing to wear masks.\nCornyn shared a photo on Oct. 14 that shows Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Richard Blumenthal and Cory Booker huddled together. The caption asks, \"What\u2019s missing in this photo?\" Cornyn\u2019s quote-retweet then added, \"Masks?\"\u00a0\nThe original tweet was posted about nine hours before Cornyn retweeted it.\n\nSenate leaders have encouraged lawmakers to wear masks this year to combat the spread of COVID-19. But Cornyn\u2019s suggestion that the senators\u2019 masks are missing is misleading. The photo in the tweets wasn\u2019t taken during the pandemic.\nA reverse-image search shows that the photo is authentic, but it was taken in September 2018 by Getty photographer Mark Wilson during Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image caption in the Getty archive reads: \"Democratic senators Sen.
