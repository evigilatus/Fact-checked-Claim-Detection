(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe source of the post is a Trump-supporting real estate agent based in Eugene, Ore. We reached out to her for evidence to back up the post, but we haven\u2019t heard back. So we looked into it.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nThe post is wrong \u2014\u00a0several fact-checkers have debunked it.\nBiden would increase capital gains taxes for Americans who make more than $1 million per year. Those taxes apply to home sales if sellers make hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit.\nFirst, let\u2019s review what capital gains taxes are.\nA capital gain is the difference between what someone paid for an asset, also known as the \"basis,\" and what they sold it for. The capital gains tax is the main federal tax that the Internal Revenue Service imposes on real estate.\nFor example, if you purchased a house for $250,000 and sold it for $300,000, your capital gain would be $50,000. However, the IRS typically lets sellers deduct up to $250,000 in capital gains if they\u2019re single and $500,000 if they\u2019re married and file joint tax returns, so you probably wouldn\u2019t owe anything.\nBiden has not proposed changing those exemptions. He also hasn\u2019t advocated raising taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 per year, as we\u2019ve reported.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn his official campaign website, Biden says he would double the long-term capital gains rate from 20% to 39.6%. His administration would use that money to help pay for Biden\u2019s health care plan.\nHowever, the 39.6% tax rate would only apply to those making more than $1 million per year. That means Biden\u2019s proposal would not affect the vast majority of people \u2014\u00a08.5% of Americans make more than $200,000 annually.\u00a0\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service, the capital gains tax rate \"is no higher than 15% for most individuals.\"\n\"Some or all net capital gain may be taxed at 0% if your taxable income is less than $78,750,\" the agency says. \"A capital gain rate of 15% applies if your taxable income is $78,750 or more but less than $434,550 for single; $488,850 for married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er); $461,700 for head of household, or $244,425 for married filing separately.\"\nWhat does that look like in practice? Let\u2019s break it down.\nLet\u2019s pretend you\u2019re married and file taxes jointly. You and your partner\u2019s combined annual income is $650,000, putting your household in the IRS\u2019 top federal income tax bracket. You decide to sell your house, which you purchased for $400,000. To your surprise, you get your full asking price of $700,000.\nRELATED: No, Joe Biden doesn\u2019t want to impose a federal tax on homes\nYour capital gain would be $300,000 on the home \u2014\u00a0several times higher than the nationwide average. Since your household\u2019s annual income is less than $1 million, Biden\u2019s proposed capital gains tax rate would not apply to you. And since you\u2019re married and file taxes jointly, you probably wouldn\u2019t owe the IRS capital gains taxes anyway.\u00a0\nSo in what real estate scenario would Biden\u2019s proposed capital gains tax rate kick in?\u00a0\nFirst, your household would have to make more than $1 million per year. Then, if you\u2019re single, you\u2019d have to sell your house for at least a $250,000 profit. If you\u2019re married and jointly file taxes, you\u2019d have to make $500,000 on a home sale.\nFor the vast majority of Americans, that is unlikely \u2014\u00a0and far from a blanket tax on home sales, as the Facebook post says.\nWe reached out to the Biden campaign for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
