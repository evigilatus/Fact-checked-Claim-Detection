So were we.\nMaking the grade\nLong ago, Cairo was a thriving river port. The town figured in a key plot twist of Mark Twain\u2019s Huckleberry Finn as the point where Huck and his friend Jim, a slave, planned to stop their southward drifting raft trip on the Mississippi so Jim could catch a boat north into the free states. Their raft, however, bypassed the port in a fog.\nAs the economic heart of Illinois shifted toward Chicago, the state\u2019s so-called Little Egypt region was hard hit, few places more so than Cairo.\nOne consequence is that residents of the bottom end of the state have come to develop an innate wariness of politicians from the north coming to court votes without spending much time trying to understand the region or its needs.\nEnter Chris Kennedy and his sweeping statement about the education shortcomings of high school seniors that left many in Cairo scratching their heads and wondering how the candidate could make such a claim without ever setting foot in the school.\nThat\u2019s because 18 of the 24 members of Cairo\u2019s 2018 high school graduating class have received at least one college offer, according to Andrea Evers, the superintendent of the Cairo junior and senior high school where, because of declining enrollment, grades 6-12 are taught under one roof.\nTen of those students have also gotten a head start by taking college classes through a dual enrollment program at a nearby community college.\nBut Kennedy wasn\u2019t referring to any of that in making his point about the ramifications of limited state funding. When we reached out to his campaign, a spokeswoman confirmed he made his claim about zero college readiness based solely on a reading of state standardized test data.\nThat said, he made two different statements citing two contradictory sets of figures. What explains the difference?\nHis initial comment referenced an overview of Cairo students\u2019 ACT scores that showed none of those who took the test last year scored high enough to be considered college-ready in all four core subjects. That compares with 28 percent readiness in all four subjects among students statewide.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state once required all high school juniors to take the ACT college admissions test, and the results were then used to benchmark student proficiency. But Illinois dropped the mandatory ACT rule in 2015, eventually replacing it with a requirement that juniors take the competing SAT college admissions test.\nSo when Kennedy chose to highlight ACT test results for students in Cairo\u2019s class of 2018, he was pointing to an incomplete set of data. It did not reflect the scores of the entire class, but only those students who chose to take the ACT.\nWhat\u2019s more, a caveat about the incompleteness of the data is posted clearly on the website of the Illinois State Board of Education where Kennedy or his staff found the numbers.\nIt reads in part: \"This percentage relates to the students in the class who chose to take the ACT test before graduation and is not representative of the entire class, district or state.\"\nKennedy\u2019s second statement to the Southern Illinoisan that mentioned a 6 percent proficiency number referred to SAT results also posted on the state board website.\nBut whichever data set Kennedy was referring to, Evers said he still missed the mark.\n\"He was looking at a data set and interpreting it without ever having a conversation with anyone locally,\" said Evers, who has been with the district for six years and can rattle off a long list of political leaders who have made the trek to Cairo, including Democratic U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth.\nThe state school board, which compiled the testing data Kennedy drew from, likewise cautioned against using test data in a vacuum to determine how prepared students are for college.\n\"I wouldn\u2019t say that the SAT is the only indicator of college and career readiness because it\u2019s one test and so it can only tell you so much,\" ISBE spokeswoman Jackie Matthews said. \"We\u2019re building out a much more robust college and career readiness indicator that looks at a lot more experiences that students have in high school that are very important and aren\u2019t necessarily captured by the SAT.\"\nA draft of that plan was presented to the board in January. It considers factors like volunteer and work experience along with taking classes for college credit, as some of Cairo\u2019s seniors are doing.\nOur ruling\nKennedy tried to make a point about inadequate state school funding when he declared \"zero percent of kids in Cairo are college-ready.\"\nBut school officials in that deep southern Illinois community report a majority of current seniors have already received acceptance offers from at least one college.\nKennedy backtracked on his original statement when news media sought clarification, though he did not admit error. In the second go-around, he pointed to slightly better numbers from a different set of state-collected test data.\nThe first figure Kennedy referenced relied on the ACT, a test the state no longer uses for its proficiency benchmark. Some, but not all, Cairo students took that test, meaning the results were incomplete and did not reflect the performance of the entire class of 2018. The caveat is clearly stated on the schools website accessed by the Kennedy campaign to derive data about Cairo.\nKennedy later revised his comments to cite a different set of college preparedness data based on a different test that the state now administers to high schoolers. The results from that second set of tests, the SAT, are not great when it comes to Cairo, but they also don\u2019t show zero percent college preparedness.\nIt also should be stressed that the Illinois State Board of Education cautions against using a standardized test score as the sole indicator of college preparedness.\nThe confusing set of numbers and assertions reeled out by Kennedy to bolster his comments about Cairo students make it clear he didn\u2019t do his homework before claiming initially that no members of the graduating class of 2018 were prepared for college. For that reason, we rate his statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02361"}
