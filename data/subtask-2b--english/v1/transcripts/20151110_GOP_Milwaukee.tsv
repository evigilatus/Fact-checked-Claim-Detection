0001	CAVUTO	It is 900 p.m. on the East Coast, 800 p.m. here inside the Milwaukee theater.
0002	CAVUTO	Welcome to the Republican presidential debate here on the Fox Business Network.
0003	CAVUTO	I'm Neil Cavuto, alongside my comoderators, Maria Bartiromo, and the editorinchief of the Wall Street Journal, Gerard Baker.
0004	BARTIROMO	Tonight we're partnering with the Wall Street Journal to ask questions on the economy that voters want answered.
0005	BARTIROMO	We're also working with Facebook, who tells us that since the first Republican debate, more than 58 million people have joined the political conversation online.
0006	BARTIROMO	More than 9 million are talking specifically about the economy.
0007	BAKER	The candidates on stage tonight were selected based on their standing in an average of four national polls.
0008	BAKER	Those standings determining their position on the stage.
0009	BAKER	And here they are.
0010	BAKER	At center stage, businessman Donald Trump.
0011	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0012	BAKER	Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson.
0013	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0014	CAVUTO	Florida Senator Marco Rubio.
0015	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0016	CAVUTO	Texas Senator Ted Cruz.
0017	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0018	CAVUTO	Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.
0019	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0020	BARTIROMO	Businesswoman Carly Fiorina.
0021	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0022	BARTIROMO	Ohio Governor John Kasich.
0023	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0024	BARTIROMO	And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.
0025	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0026	BAKER	Tonight's rules are simple.
0027	BAKER	Up to 90 second for each answer.
0028	BAKER	One minute for each followup response.
0029	BAKER	And if a candidate goes over their allotted time, you'll here this.
0030	CAVUTO	It sounds like a game show but it's not.
0031	CAVUTO	Now I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the elephant in the room, and I'm not talking about your party's fine symbol.
0032	CAVUTO	I'm talking about the purpose of tonight's debate.
0033	CAVUTO	The economy and what each of you would do to improve it.
0034	CAVUTO	No more, no less.
0035	CAVUTO	We are focused on those issues, and what you have said on those issues in your words and what your opponents have said in their words about your words.
0036	CAVUTO	That is the agenda tonight.
0037	CAVUTO	How each of you plans to make America better tomorrow.
0038	CAVUTO	And so we begin.
0039	CAVUTO	Candidates, as we gather tonight in this very august theater, just outside and across the country, picketers are gathering as well.
0040	CAVUTO	They're demanding an immediate hike in the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
0041	CAVUTO	Just a few hours ago, near Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed doing the same for all state workers, the first governor to do so.
0042	CAVUTO	Mr. Trump, as the leading presidential candidate on this stage and one whose tax plan exempts couples making up to $50,000 a year from paying any federal income taxes at all, are you sympathetic to the protesters cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year?
0043	TRUMP	I can't be Neil.
0044	TRUMP	And the and the reason I can't be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily.
0045	TRUMP	There is nothing that we do now to win.
0046	TRUMP	We don't win anymore.
0047	TRUMP	Our taxes are too high.
0048	TRUMP	I've come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much.
0049	TRUMP	It's going to be a tremendous plan.
0050	TRUMP	I think it'll make our country and our economy very dynamic.
0051	TRUMP	But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world.
0052	TRUMP	I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is.
0053	TRUMP	People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum.
0054	TRUMP	But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world.
0055	TRUMP	We just can't do it.
0056	CAVUTO	So do not raise the minimum wage?
0057	TRUMP	I would not do it.
0058	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0059	CAVUTO	Dr. Carson, you have long bemoaned this lackluster recovery.
0060	CAVUTO	And this Facebook map show Americans share your concern.
0061	CAVUTO	The green represents how the jobs issue is resonating all across the nation, especially here in the state of Wisconsin.
0062	CAVUTO	You suggested one minimum wage does not fit all, and that perhaps we should offer a lower or starter wage for young people.
0063	CAVUTO	Those protesters outside are looking for $15 and nothing less.
0064	CAVUTO	Where are you?
0065	CARSON	Well, first of all, delighted to be here.
0066	CARSON	My family's here, and my little granddaughter, who's three years old, said she wanted to come to the debate.
0067	CARSON	So this is very cool.
0068	CARSON	As far as the minimum wage is concerned, people need to be educated on the minimum wage.
0069	CARSON	Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.
0070	CARSON	It's particularly a problem in the black community.
0071	CARSON	Only 19.8 percent of black teenagers have a job, who are looking for one.
0072	CARSON	You know, that  and that's because of those high wages.
0073	CARSON	If you lower those wages, that comes down.
0074	CARSON	You know, I can remember, as a youngster  you know, my first job working in a laboratory as a lab assistant, and multiple other jobs.
0075	CARSON	But I would not have gotten those jobs if someone had to pay me a large amount of money.
0076	CARSON	But what I did gain from those jobs is a tremendous amount of experience, and how to operate in the world and how to relate to different people, and how to become a responsible individual.
0077	CARSON	And that's what gave me what I needed to ascend the ladder of opportunity in this country.
0078	CARSON	That's what we need to be thinking about.
0079	CARSON	How do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity, rather than how do we give them everything and keep them dependent?
0080	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0081	CAVUTO	So, sir, just to be clear, you would not raise it?
0082	CARSON	I would not raise it.
0083	CARSON	I would not raise it, specifically because I'm interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities.
0084	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0085	CAVUTO	Senator Rubio, you called the recent Democratic debate in Las Vegas a night of giveaways, including free health care, free college and a host of other governmentpaid benefits.
0086	CAVUTO	Since you aren't a fan of all they're giving away, tell us tonight what you would take back.
0087	RUBIO	Well, let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related.
0088	RUBIO	As I've said many times before, my parents were never rich people.
0089	RUBIO	My father was a bartender.
0090	RUBIO	My mother was a maid.
0091	RUBIO	They worked for a living.
0092	RUBIO	But they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves.
0093	RUBIO	We call that the American dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world.
0094	RUBIO	It is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people.
0095	RUBIO	What makes America special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful.
0096	RUBIO	The problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough.
0097	RUBIO	If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, I would be all for it, but it isn't.
0098	RUBIO	In the 20th century, it's a disaster.
0099	RUBIO	If you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine.
0100	RUBIO	And that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.
0101	RUBIO	Here's the best way to raise wages.
0102	RUBIO	Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training.
0103	RUBIO	For the life of me, I don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education.
0104	RUBIO	Welders make more money than philosophers.
0105	RUBIO	We need more welders and less philosophers.
0106	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0107	RUBIO	If we do that  and if we do this  if we do this, we will be able to increase wages for millions of Americans and we will be able to leave everyone better off without making anyone worse off.
0108	CAVUTO	Thank you, Senator Rubio.
0109	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0110	BARTIROMO	We've asked people on Facebook to submit their questions for the candidates.
0111	BARTIROMO	Seth Bell wrote, "We are approaching $20 trillion in national debt.
0112	BARTIROMO	Specifically, what plans do you have to cut federal spending?"
0113	BARTIROMO	Governor Kasich, you have spoken much about your success in balancing the budget under President Clinton.
0114	BARTIROMO	Today the national debt is at record highs and growing unsustainably.
0115	BARTIROMO	Interest will be the fastestgrowing part of the federal budget, tripling over the next 10 years.
0116	BARTIROMO	Social Security, the lifeline of millions of American seniors, is rushing toward insolvency.
0117	BARTIROMO	With all of the tax plans presented tonight, estimated to cost anywhere between $2 trillion and $12 trillion over a decade, what specific steps will you take to balance the budget?
0118	KASICH	First of all, let me just say that, in the state of Ohio  and I'm the only acting executive on  on this stage today  we do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage.
0119	KASICH	And I got to tell you, my father carried mail on his back.
0120	KASICH	His father was a coal miner.
0121	KASICH	He died of black lung.
0122	KASICH	He was losing his eyesight.
0123	KASICH	My mother's mother lived with us.
0124	KASICH	She could barely speak English.
0125	KASICH	I come from a town where if the wind blew the wrong way, people found themselves out of work.
0126	KASICH	An economic theory is fine, but you know what?
0127	KASICH	People need help.
0128	KASICH	Now, I have a plan that, in fact, would cut taxes, but not $11 trillion or $12 trillion that would put my children further in debt.
0129	KASICH	I have a plan that would not only cut taxes, lower the income tax rate for individuals, lower the tax for businesses so businesses will compete here and not move operations overseas, and also a plan  the only plan of anybody standing on this stage to get us to a balanced budget by the end of a second term.
0130	KASICH	And, you know, the simple fact of the matter is, we hear a lot of promises in this debate, a lot of promises about these tax cuts or tax schemes sometimes that I call them.
0131	KASICH	Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side.
0132	KASICH	We've got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side.
0133	KASICH	Yes, lower taxes, lower spending.
0134	KASICH	My website, JohnKasich.com, will show you exactly how we balance the budget.
0135	KASICH	I balanced the budget in Washington as a chief architect, and I have balanced it in Ohio for one reason.
0136	KASICH	When you balance the budget and you cut taxes, people get work.
0137	KASICH	And our most important moral purpose as leaders in the political system is to make sure we create an environment for job creation so people can live their dreams and realize their Godgiven potential.
0138	KASICH	That's why it's so important.
0139	KASICH	And for those at the bottom, we've got to do what we can to train them so they can move up.
0140	KASICH	But to just look the other way is not acceptable, because, you know what, as the governor of Ohio I have to deal with real challenges, and we've gotten it done in our state, and I will do it for America.
0141	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0142	BARTIROMO	Did you want to name any specific steps, sir?
0143	KASICH	Sure.
0144	KASICH	We would move the Medicare system from a 7 percent growth down to about a 5 percent growth.
0145	KASICH	And I have a whole series of ways to do that.
0146	KASICH	In Ohio, we reduced Medicaid funding for the poor from 10 percent to 2.5 percent, didn't cut one benefit or didn't take anybody off the rolls.
0147	KASICH	Why?
0148	KASICH	Because we're innovators.
0149	KASICH	I've been an innovator my entire career.
0150	KASICH	And I really don't care what special interests or lobbyists have to say.
0151	KASICH	I have a job to do when I take over a public office.
0152	KASICH	Now, we freeze nondefense discretionary for eight years.
0153	KASICH	We also put an increase in defense spending.
0154	KASICH	Our tax cuts balance out.
0155	KASICH	And at the end of the day, we will get to a balanced budget.
0156	KASICH	And I want everybody here to know, when I was Budget Committee chairman in Washington, I stepped on every toe in that town, and we got to a balanced budget, and we had enormous job growth.
0157	KASICH	And as governor of Ohio, we went from 350,000 lost jobs to a gain of 347,000 jobs.
0158	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
0159	KASICH	I'll do it in Washington.
0160	KASICH	I've done it twice I'll do it thrice for the United States of America.
0161	BARTIROMO	Senator Cruz, the International Monetary Fund recently cut its expectations for economic growth.
0162	BARTIROMO	Many economists expect a recession to hit the U.S. within the next year due to the weakening of manufacturing.
0163	BARTIROMO	The next president will have to deal with it.
0164	BARTIROMO	You say tax reform is a powerful lever to spur economic expansion.
0165	BARTIROMO	You're calling for a 10 percent income tax and a 16 percent business tax.
0166	BARTIROMO	What other elements do you need in this plan to actually create jobs?
0167	CRUZ	Well, Maria, it's great to be with you.
0168	CRUZ	It's great to be here in Milwaukee.
0169	CRUZ	You know, the question you asked really I think is the most important question any of us can have  face, which is, how do we get the economy growing?
0170	CRUZ	How do we bring back economic growth?
0171	CRUZ	Because economic growth, it's foundational to every other challenge we have.
0172	CRUZ	As you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average.
0173	CRUZ	The Obama economy is a disaster, and the IMF is telling us this is a new normal.
0174	CRUZ	It doesn't have to be.
0175	CRUZ	If you look at the history of America, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth.
0176	CRUZ	The first is tax reform.
0177	CRUZ	And as you noted, I have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax 10 percent for every American that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade.
0178	CRUZ	The second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses.
0179	CRUZ	And the third element is sound money.
0180	CRUZ	Every time we've pursued all three of those  whether in the 1920s with Calvin Coolidge or the 1960s with JFK or the 1980s with Ronald Reagan  the result has been incredible economic growth.
0181	CRUZ	We have done it before, and with leadership, we can do it again.
0182	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0183	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
0184	KASICH	Excuse me.
0185	BARTIROMO	Governor Bush...
0186	KASICH	Yeah, I would like to make a comment.
0187	BUSH	You've already made two comments, John.
0188	BUSH	It's my turn.
0189	BARTIROMO	We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich, coming up.
0190	BARTIROMO	We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich.
0191	BUSH	I got about four minutes in the last debate.
0192	BUSH	I'm going to get my question right now.
0193	KASICH	I appreciate it, Jeb.
0194	KASICH	I'm all of you.
0195	KASICH	But I want at some point to talk about a valueadded tax and $11 trillion, $12 trillion tax cuts that will put our kids way deeper in the hole than they have been at this point.
0196	KASICH	So I would like to talk about it at some point, because that's what leadership is.
0197	BARTIROMO	We will  we will certainly get to that.
0198	BARTIROMO	Governor Bush?
0199	BUSH	Yes.
0200	BARTIROMO	Almost 40 percent of Americans are without a job and are not looking.
0201	BARTIROMO	Many have given up.
0202	BARTIROMO	That's what the participation rate tells us.
0203	BARTIROMO	You've said your policies will drive the economy back to 4 percent growth, which we haven't seen since the year 2000.
0204	BARTIROMO	What specific regulations would you change?
0205	BARTIROMO	And how will that lead to jobs and growth?
0206	BUSH	First of all, we could get to 4 percent growth.
0207	BUSH	The new normal of 2 percent puts huge demands on government.
0208	BUSH	The reason why we have structural deficits is that more and more people are relying on government and the growth that we don't have makes  makes the deficit grow.
0209	BUSH	A 4 percent growth strategy starts with tax reform.
0210	BUSH	And the proposal that I've laid out is the one the Wall Street Journal editorial board has said is the most progrowth of all the proposals out there.
0211	BUSH	We cut the  we eliminate a lot of deductions and cut the rates down.
0212	BUSH	A corporate rate of 20 percent, which puts us 5 percent above  below that of China, and allows us full expensing of investing.
0213	BUSH	It would create an explosion of investment back into this country, creating higherwage jobs, and so that's part of it.
0214	BUSH	On the regulatory side I think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has in terms of work in progress, every one of them.
0215	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0216	BUSH	And start over.
0217	BUSH	For those that are already in existence, the regulation of the Internet, we have to start over, but we ought to do that.
0218	BUSH	The clean power act, we ought to repeal that and  and start over on that.
0219	BUSH	The waters of the United States act, which is going to be devastating for agriculture and many industries, we should repeal that.
0220	BUSH	We should repeal the rules because the economic costs of this far exceed the social benefit.
0221	BUSH	And if we're serious about being serious about high growth, then we have to recognize that small businesses right now, more of them are closing than  than are  than are being set up.
0222	BUSH	Hillary Clinton has said that Barack Obama's policies get an A.
0223	BUSH	Really?
0224	BUSH	One in 10 people right now aren't working or have given up altogether, as you said.
0225	BUSH	That's not an A.
0226	BUSH	One in seven people are living in poverty.
0227	BUSH	That's not an A.
0228	BUSH	One in five children are on food stamps.
0229	BUSH	That is not an A.
0230	BUSH	It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do, but it's not the best America can do.
0231	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0232	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
0233	BAKER	Ms. Fiorina, while you've all pointed out how weak the current recovery has been and how disappointing by any historical standards, in the general election, the Democrats will inevitably ask you and voters to compare the recent president's jobs performance.
0234	BAKER	Now, in seven years under President Obama, the U.S. has added an average of 107,000 jobs a month.
0235	BAKER	Under President Clinton, the economy added about 240,000 jobs a month.
0236	BAKER	Under George W. Bush, it was only 13,000 a month.
0237	BAKER	If you win the nomination, you'll probably be facing a Democrat named Clinton.
0238	BAKER	How are you going to respond to the claim that Democratic presidents are better at creating jobs than Republicans?
0239	FIORINA	Well, first of all, I must say as I think about that question, I think about a woman I met the other day.
0240	FIORINA	I would guess she was 40 years old.
0241	FIORINA	She had several children.
0242	FIORINA	And she said to me, you know, Carly, I go to bed every night afraid for my children's future.
0243	FIORINA	And that really struck me.
0244	FIORINA	This is America.
0245	FIORINA	A mother is going to bed afraid for her children's future.
0246	FIORINA	And the reason she's afraid for her children's future is because we've had problems for a long time.
0247	FIORINA	Yes, problems have gotten much worse under Democrats.
0248	FIORINA	But the truth is, this government has been growing bigger and bigger, more corrupt, less effective, crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time.
0249	FIORINA	This isn't about just replacing a Democrat with a Republican now.
0250	FIORINA	It's about actually challenging the status quo of big government.
0251	FIORINA	Big government has created a big business called politics.
0252	FIORINA	And there are lots of people invested in the status quo of that big business called politics.
0253	FIORINA	Specifically, we need actually to do five things to really get this economy going again.
0254	FIORINA	We need to go to zerobased budgeting so we know where every dollar is being spent, we can challenge any dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar.
0255	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0256	FIORINA	We need to actually reform the tax code.
0257	FIORINA	Go to a threepage tax code.
0258	FIORINA	Yes, there are plans that would reform our tax code to three pages.
0259	FIORINA	In addition to rolling back what President Obama has done, we need to do a toptobottom review of every single regulation on the books.
0260	FIORINA	That hasn't been done in 50 years.
0261	FIORINA	We need to pass the REINS Act so Congress is in charge of regulation, not nameless, faceless bureaucrats accountable to no one.
0262	FIORINA	We've become a nation of rules, not a nation of laws.
0263	FIORINA	And finally we actually, yes, have to hold government officials accountable for their performance.
0264	FIORINA	All this has to be done, and the citizens of this nation must help a President Fiorina get it done.
0265	FIORINA	We must take our government back.
0266	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0267	BAKER	Thank you.
0268	BAKER	Thank you.
0269	BAKER	Senator Paul, income inequality has been rising in the United States.
0270	BAKER	Fifty years ago, for example, the average CEO of a big corporation in this country earned 20 times the average salary of one of his or her workers.
0271	BAKER	Today, that CEO earns about 300 times the average salary of a worker.
0272	BAKER	Does it matter at all that the gap between the rich and everyone else is widening?
0273	PAUL	Absolutely.
0274	PAUL	And I think that we ought to look where income inequality seems to be the worst.
0275	PAUL	It seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats, governors of...
0276	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0277	PAUL	States run by Democrats and countries currently run by Democrats.
0278	PAUL	So the thing is, let's look for root causes.
0279	PAUL	But I would also say  lay some blame at the  the feet of the Federal Reserve.
0280	PAUL	I think the Federal Reserve has made this problem worse.
0281	PAUL	By artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money.
0282	PAUL	They're actually talking now about negative interest.
0283	PAUL	The money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in New York.
0284	PAUL	And because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy.
0285	PAUL	So what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality.
0286	PAUL	We also find that as the Federal Reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst.
0287	PAUL	So really we need to reexamine whether we not  we want a Federal Reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates.
0288	PAUL	We also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse.
0289	PAUL	But the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a Republican mayor or a state with a Republican governor.
0290	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0291	BAKER	Thank you, Senator.

0301	CAVUTO	You recently railed against the double standard in the media, sir, that seems obsessed with inconsistencies and potential exaggerations in your life story, but looked the other way when it came to thenSenator Barack Obama's.
0302	CAVUTO	Still, as a candidate whose brand has always been trust, are you worried your campaign  which you've always said, sir, is bigger than you  is now being hurt by you?
0303	CARSON	Well, first of all, thank you not asking me what I said in the 10th grade.
0304	CARSON	I appreciate that.
0305	SYSTEM	[ laughter and a pplause ]
0306	CAVUTO	I'll just forget that followup there.
0307	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0308	CARSON	The fact of the matter is, you know, what  we should vet all candidates.
0309	CARSON	I have no problem with being vetted.
0310	CARSON	What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth.
0311	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0312	CARSON	And I don't even mind that so much, if they do it about  with everybody, like people on the other side.
0313	CARSON	But, you know, when I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video.
0314	CARSON	Where I came from, they call that a lie.
0315	CARSON	And...
0316	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0317	CARSON	I think that's very different from, you know, somebody misinterpreting, when I said that I was offered a scholarship to West Point, that is the words that they used.
0318	CARSON	But, I've had many people come and say the same thing to me.
0319	CARSON	That is what people do in those situations.
0320	CARSON	We have to start treating people the same, and finding out what people really think and what they're made of.
0321	CARSON	People who know me know that I'm an honest person.
0322	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0323	CAVUTO	Thank you, Dr. Carson.
0324	BARTIROMO	Mr. Trump, a federal appeals court just dealt a blow to the Obama administration's plan to prevent the deportation of 5 million people living in this country illegally.
0325	BARTIROMO	The White House is appealing to the Supreme Court.
0326	BARTIROMO	At the heart of this issue is the effect that illegal immigrants are having on our economy, what will you do about it?
0327	TRUMP	I was so happy yesterday when I saw that decision come down.
0328	TRUMP	That was an unbelievable decision.
0329	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0330	TRUMP	And we don't have enough of those decisions coming down.
0331	TRUMP	He of the executive order, because nobody wants to listen to him, including the Democrats, so he just goes around signing executive orders.
0332	TRUMP	That was a great day.
0333	TRUMP	And, frankly, we have to stop illegal immigration.
0334	TRUMP	It's hurting us economically.
0335	TRUMP	It's hurting us from every standpoint.
0336	TRUMP	It's causing tremendous difficulty with respect to drugs and what that does to many of our inner cities in particular.
0337	TRUMP	And it really is  was such an unbelievable moment because the courts have not been ruling in our favor.
0338	TRUMP	And it was a 21 decision.
0339	TRUMP	And it was a terrific thing that happened.
0340	TRUMP	And I will tell you, we are a country of laws.
0341	TRUMP	We need borders.
0342	TRUMP	We will have a wall.
0343	TRUMP	The wall will be built.
0344	TRUMP	The wall will be successful.
0345	TRUMP	And if you think walls don't work, all you have to do is ask Israel.
0346	TRUMP	The wall works, believe me.
0347	TRUMP	Properly done.
0348	TRUMP	Believe me.
0349	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0350	BARTIROMO	Can we just send 5 million people back with no effect on economy?
0351	TRUMP	You are going to have to bring people  you are going to have to send people out.
0352	TRUMP	Look, we're a country...
0353	BARTIROMO	So what will you do?
0354	TRUMP	Maria, we're a country of laws.
0355	TRUMP	We either have a country or we don't have a country.
0356	TRUMP	We are a country of laws.
0357	TRUMP	Going to have to go out and they will come back but they are going to have to go out and hopefully they get back.
0358	TRUMP	But we have no choice if we're going to run our country properly and if we're going to be a country.
0359	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0360	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
0361	KASICH	Maria, can we comment on that?
0362	BAKER	Senator Rubio...
0363	KASICH	Can we comment on that?
0364	BAKER	Yes, one quick comment, yes.
0365	KASICH	Well, look, in 1986 Ronald Reagan basically said the people who were here, if they were lawabiding, could stay.
0366	KASICH	But, what didn't happen is we didn't build the walls effectively and we didn't control the border.
0367	KASICH	We need to.
0368	KASICH	We need to control our border just like people have to control who goes in and out of their house.
0369	KASICH	But if people think that we are going to ship 11 million people who are lawabiding, who are in this country, and somehow pick them up at their house and ship them out of Mexico  to Mexico, think about the families.
0370	KASICH	Think about the children.
0371	KASICH	So, you know what the answer really is?
0372	KASICH	If they have been law abiding, they pay a penalty.
0373	KASICH	They get to stay.
0374	KASICH	We protect the wall.
0375	KASICH	Anybody else comes over, they go back.
0376	KASICH	But for the 11 million people, come on, folks.
0377	KASICH	We all know you can't pick them up and ship them across, back across the border.
0378	KASICH	It's a silly argument.
0379	KASICH	It is not an adult argument.
0380	KASICH	It makes no sense.
0381	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0382	TRUMP	All I can say is, you're lucky in Ohio that you struck oil.
0383	TRUMP	That is for one thing.
0384	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0385	TRUMP	Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president, people liked him.
0386	TRUMP	I like Ike, right?
0387	TRUMP	The expression.
0388	TRUMP	I like Ike.
0389	TRUMP	Moved a 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border.
0390	TRUMP	They came back.
0391	TRUMP	Moved them again beyond the border, they came back.
0392	TRUMP	Didn't like it.
0393	TRUMP	Moved them way south.
0394	TRUMP	They never came back.
0395	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0396	TRUMP	Dwight Eisenhower.
0397	TRUMP	You don't get nicer.
0398	TRUMP	You don't get friendlier.
0399	TRUMP	They moved a 1.5 million out.
0400	TRUMP	We have no choice.
0401	TRUMP	We have no choice.

0410	UNKNOWN	We have grown  we have grown...
0411	TRUMP	No, it's unfair.
0412	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0413	KASICH	In the state of Ohio, the state of Ohio, we have grown 347,000 jobs.
0414	KASICH	Our unemployment is half of what it was.
0415	KASICH	Our fracking industry, energy industry may have contributed 20,000, but if Mr. Trump understood that the real jobs come in the downstream, not in the upstream, but in the downstream.
0416	KASICH	And that's where we're going to get our jobs.
0417	KASICH	But Ohio is diversified.
0418	KASICH	And little false little things, sir, they don't really work when it comes to the truth.
0419	KASICH	So the fact is, all I'm suggesting, we can't ship 11 million people out of this country.
0420	KASICH	Children would be terrified, and it will not work.

0426	BAKER	Governor Bush?
0427	BUSH	Thank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate.
0428	BUSH	That's really nice of you.
0429	BUSH	Really appreciate that.

0432	BUSH	Twelve million illegal immigrants, to send them back, 500,000 a month, is just not  not possible.

0434	BUSH	And it would tear communities apart.
0435	BUSH	And it would send a signal that we're not the kind of country that I know America is.
0436	BUSH	And even having this conversation sends a powerful signal  they're doing highfives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this.
0437	BUSH	That's the problem with this.
0438	BUSH	We have to win the presidency.
0439	BUSH	And the way you win the presidency is to have practical plans.
0440	BUSH	Lay them out there.
0441	BUSH	What we need to do is allow people to earn legal status where they pay a fine, where they work, where they don't commit crimes, where they learn English, and over an extended period of time, they earn legal status.

0447	TRUMP	We have millions of people right now on line trying to come into this country.
0448	TRUMP	Very, very unfair to the people that want to come into our country legally.
0449	TRUMP	They've gone through the process.
0450	TRUMP	They're on line.
0451	TRUMP	They're waiting.
0452	TRUMP	Very, very unfair to them.
0453	TRUMP	That I can tell you.
0454	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0455	BAKER	Senator Rubio, Senator Rubio, let me  let me take you to a question that I think gets to the root of a lot of the anxiety that people have in this country.
0456	BAKER	The economy is undergoing a transformation through information technology.
0457	BAKER	Americans are anxious that the new economy isn't producing higherpaying jobs.
0458	BAKER	Many are concerned that the new wealth seems to be going mainly to innovators and investors.
0459	BAKER	Meanwhile, with factories run by robots and shopping done increasingly on smartphones, many traditional jobs are just going away.
0460	BAKER	How do you reassure American workers that their jobs are not being steadily replaced by machines?
0461	RUBIO	Well, you know, that's an excellent question, because what we are going through in this country is not simply an economic downturn.
0462	RUBIO	We are living through a massive economic transformation.
0463	RUBIO	I mean, this economy is nothing like what it was like five years ago, not to mention 15 or 20 years ago.
0464	RUBIO	And it isn't just a different economy.
0465	RUBIO	It's changing faster than ever.
0466	RUBIO	You know, it took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users.
0467	RUBIO	It took Candy Crush one year to reach some 100 million users.
0468	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0469	RUBIO	So the world is changing faster than ever, and it is disruptive.
0470	RUBIO	Number one, we are in a global competition now, and several of the candidates have said that.
0471	RUBIO	There are now dozens of developed economies on this planet that we have to compete with.
0472	RUBIO	And we lose that competition because we have the highest business tax rate in the industrialized world, because we have regulations that continue to grow by the billions every single week, because we have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people, but because we're not fully utilizing our energy resources, that if we did, it would bring back all kinds of growth, especially in manufacturing, and because we have an outdated higher education system.
0473	RUBIO	Our higher education system is completely outdated.
0474	RUBIO	It is too expensive, too hard to access, and it doesn't teach 21st century skills.
0475	RUBIO	If we do what needs to be done  tax reform, regulatory reform, fully utilize our energy resources, repeal and replace Obamacare, and modernize higher education, then we can grasp the potential and the promise of this new economy.
0476	RUBIO	And we won't just save the American dream.
0477	RUBIO	We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before.
0478	RUBIO	And then truly this new century can be a new American century.
0479	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0480	BAKER	Thank you.
0481	BAKER	Senator Cruz  Senator Cruz, entitlements.
0482	BAKER	You've argued for raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for future retirees, but reducing any sort of benefits for the elderly has always been notoriously hard to do politically.
0483	BAKER	When Speaker Paul Ryan proposed replacing traditional Medicare with federally funded private plans a few years ago, a liberal group responded with a commercial that featured a granny being pushed off a cliff.
0484	BAKER	What's going to be different this time?
0485	CRUZ	Well, my Mom is here, so I don't think we should be pushing any grannies off cliffs.
0486	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0487	CRUZ	And, you missstated what I've said on entitlement reform.
0488	CRUZ	What I've said is for seniors we should make no changes whatsoever, for younger workers we should gradually raise the retirement age, we should have benefits grow more slowly, and we should allow them to keep a portion of their taxes in a personal account that they control, and can pass on to their kids...
0489	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0490	BAKER	...I said for future retirees was your statement...
0491	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0492	CRUZ	I want to go back to the discussion we had a minute ago because, you know, what was said was right.
0493	CRUZ	The democrats are laughing  because if republicans join democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose.
0494	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0495	CRUZ	And, you know, I understand that when the mainstream media covers immigration, it doesn't often see it as an economic issue.
0496	CRUZ	But, I can tell you for millions  of Americans at home watching this, it is a very personal economic issue.
0497	CRUZ	And, I will say the politics of it will be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande.
0498	SYSTEM	[ audience reaction ]
0499	CRUZ	Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press.
0500	CRUZ	[
0501	CRUZ	audience reaction ]
0502	SYSTEM	[ applause and c heering ]
0503	CRUZ	Then, we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation.
0504	CRUZ	And, I will say for those of us who believe people 'ought to come to this country legally, and we should enforce the law, we're tired of being told it's antiimmigrant.
0505	CRUZ	It's offensive.
0506	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0507	CRUZ	I am the son of an immigrant who came legally from Cuba...
0508	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]

0511	CRUZ	Try going to China, or Japan.
0512	CRUZ	Try going to Mexico.
0513	CRUZ	See what they do.
0514	CRUZ	Every sovereign nation secures its borders, and it is not compassionate to say we're not going to enforce the laws...
0515	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]

0519	BARTIROMO	We go back to Facebook.
0520	BARTIROMO	Dewayne Wesley Cato asks on Facebook, how do we get rid of regulations choking our businesses?
0521	BARTIROMO	Ms. Fiorina?
0522	BARTIROMO	Specifically, under the president's Affordable Care Act, employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance, or be fined.
0523	BARTIROMO	Many are opting to pay the fine.
0524	BARTIROMO	Others are cutting back employee hours to duck the law altogether.
0525	BARTIROMO	What specific ways will you alleviate the pressure on small business?
0526	FIORINA	Well, first Obamacare has to be repealed because it's failing...
0527	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0528	FIORINA	...it's failing the very people it was intended to help, but, also, it is croneycapitalism at its worst.
0529	FIORINA	Who helped write this bill?
0530	FIORINA	Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, every single one of those kinds of companies are bulking up to deal with big government.
0531	FIORINA	See, that's what happens.
0532	FIORINA	As government gets bigger, and bigger  and it has been for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike  and business have to bulk up to deal with big government.
0533	FIORINA	So, we have to repeal it.
0534	FIORINA	It's tens of thousands of pages long, no one can possible understand it except the big companies, the lawyers, the accountants, the lobbyists that they hire to protect their interests.
0535	FIORINA	Then, we have to give back to states the responsibility to manage a high risk pool.
0536	FIORINA	We need to try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried.
0537	FIORINA	Health insurance has always been a cozy, little game between regulators and health insurance companies.
0538	FIORINA	We need to try the free market.
0539	FIORINA	The free market.
0540	FIORINA	Where people actually have to compete.
0541	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0542	FIORINA	And, we 'ought to have the government ensure that you must  and I don't use that term often, that government 'ought to do something, but every healthcare provider 'ought to publish its costs, its prices, its outcomes, because as patients we don't know what we're buying.
0543	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0544	FIORINA	Now, let me just say  let me just say, I know more about innovation and entrepreneurship than anyone on this panel because I have led innovative businesses in the most highly competitive industry in the world for decades.
0545	FIORINA	The truth is the secret sauce of America is innovation, and entrepreneurship, it is why we must cut our government down to size, and hold it accountable.
0546	FIORINA	It's why we have to take our government back, because innovation and entrepreneurship is crushed by the crushing load of a 73,000 page tax code.
0547	FIORINA	It is crushed...
0548	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0549	FIORINA	...by regulatory thicket that is so vast we don't even know what's in it anymore.
0550	FIORINA	It is crushed as well by government bureaucrats who don't do their jobs very well, and who are not held accountable, which is why I've said we got to take our government back, and to do that, we have to know where every dollar being spent, and be able to move any dollar.
0551	FIORINA	We have to hack through this regulatory thicket, repeal so much, but, also, know what's in that regulatory thicket  we don't even know what regulations have been passed.
0552	FIORINA	Third, we need to build a meritocracy  Scott Walker, by the way, is trying now to do in Wisconsin...
0553	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0554	FIORINA	...Finally, we need to get to a three page tax code, and, yes, that plan exists.
0555	BARTIROMO	Just to be clear, you want to repeal Obamacare...
0556	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0557	BARTIROMO	..but, what's the alternative?
0558	FIORINA	Sorry, I can't hear you.
0559	BARTIROMO	Just to be clear, you say you would repeal Obamacare...
0560	FIORINA	...Absolutely...
0561	BARTIROMO	...But, what is the alternative...
0562	FIORINA	...You need to give...
0563	BARTIROMO	...and how does that help small business...
0564	FIORINA	The alternative is to allow states to manage high risk pools for those who really need help.
0565	FIORINA	Look, I'm a cancer survivor, OK?
0566	FIORINA	I understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a preexisting condition.
0567	FIORINA	I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help.
0568	FIORINA	But, I also understand that Obamacare isn't helping anyone.
0569	FIORINA	We're throwing more, and more people into Medicaid, and fewer, and fewer doctors are taking those payments.
0570	FIORINA	The point is Obamacare is crushing small businesses, it is not helping the families it was intended to help.
0571	FIORINA	So, let us allow states to manage high risk pools.
0572	FIORINA	Let us try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried, the free market.
0573	FIORINA	Let us ensure that as patients, and customers...
0574	BARTIROMO	...Thank you...
0575	FIORINA	...that we have information to shop wisely for our health care.
0576	CAVUTO	Alright, thank you.
0577	CAVUTO	We're going to take a break here.
0578	CAVUTO	Coming up, a big issue many Americans are facing, taxes.
0579	CAVUTO	The Republican Presidential Debate continues now, live, from Milwaukee.
0580	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0581	CAVUTO	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from Milwaukee.
0582	CAVUTO	Let's get back to the questions.
0583	CAVUTO	And we want to touch on obviously one of the biggest of this issue in this year, taxes.
0584	CAVUTO	And this will go to several of you.
0585	CAVUTO	One of the biggest economic concerns of course in the country are taxes.
0586	CAVUTO	Facebook data certainly backs that up.
0587	CAVUTO	Once again the green on this map that we're going to see here shows how the conversation around taxes is resonating across the nation, especially here in Wisconsin.
0588	CAVUTO	First off, Dr. Carson, to you.
0589	CAVUTO	You say you are in favor of a tax system, I guess akin to tithing, sir, with a flat tax rate of up to 15 percent because you said, if everybody pays this, I think God is a pretty fair guy, so tithing is a pretty fair process.
0590	CAVUTO	But Donald Trump says that is not fair.
0591	CAVUTO	That wealthier taxpayers should pay a higher rate because it's a fair thing to do.
0592	CAVUTO	So whose plan would God endorse then, Doctor?
0593	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0594	CAVUTO	Yours or Mr. Trump's?
0595	CARSON	Well, you know, when I say tithing, I'm talking about the concept of proportionality.
0596	CAVUTO	Right.
0597	CARSON	Everybody should pay the same proportion of what they make.
0598	CARSON	You make $10 billion, you pay a billion.
0599	CARSON	You make $10, you pay one.
0600	CARSON	You get same rights and privileges.
0601	CARSON	I don't see how anything gets a whole lot fairer than that.
0602	CARSON	But you also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes because that is the thing that tilts it in one direction or another.
0603	CARSON	And you have to set the rate at an appropriate level.
0604	CARSON	Now I will say that, there are a lot of people who say, if you get rid of the deductions, you ruin the American dream because, you know, home mortgage deduction.
0605	CARSON	But the fact of the matter is, people had homes before 1913 when we introduced the federal income tax, and later after that started deductions.
0606	CARSON	And they say there will be no more charitable giving.
0607	CARSON	We had churches before that and charitable organizations before that.
0608	CARSON	The fact of the matter is, I believe if you put more money in people's pockets that they will actually be more generous rather than less generous.
0609	CARSON	And it's...
0610	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0611	CARSON	... the money that they earned.
0612	CARSON	And, the other thing is, I do care about the poor people.
0613	CARSON	And in the system that we're putting together, there will be a rebate for people at the poverty level.
0614	CARSON	But I also want to emphasize the fact that as we get the economy moving, and I hope I get a question about how do we get the economy moving, there will be a lot more opportunities for poor people not to be poor people because this is America.
0615	CARSON	This is the land of dreams.
0616	CARSON	And our policies should be aimed at allowing people to realize that dream.
0617	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0618	CAVUTO	Thank you very much.
0619	CAVUTO	Senator Paul, you said you want to blow up the tax code and start over with an acrosstheboard 14.5 percent fair and flat tax.
0620	CAVUTO	You happily offered that it is not revenue neutral and that's the idea.
0621	CAVUTO	You want to choke off the amount of money coming into Washington.
0622	CAVUTO	But don't you risk, sir, creating a nearterm budget crisis just as your presidency would be beginning?
0623	PAUL	Well, it's a great question, Neil, and thanks for including me in the tax debate.
0624	PAUL	I think what's important about the tax debate is, is that we have to ask the question, where is money best spent, in the private sector or in the government sector?
0625	PAUL	I want a government really, really small, so small you can barely see it.
0626	PAUL	So I want lower taxes and much more money in the private sector.
0627	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0628	PAUL	My tax plan, however, is the only tax plan among any of the candidates on the stage that is part of a balanced budget plan.
0629	PAUL	I put forward three plans that actually balance the budget over a fiveyear period.
0630	PAUL	Each of these plans have details on exactly where we would cut.
0631	PAUL	The question came up earlier, where would you cut?
0632	PAUL	Nobody likes to say where they would cut.
0633	PAUL	I've put pencil to paper and done three budgets that actually balance.
0634	PAUL	I'm also in favor of a plan called the penny plan where we'd just cut 1 percent across the board and the budget actually balances in less than five years.
0635	PAUL	So I think what is extraordinary about my tax plan is it is in the context of balancing the budget.
0636	PAUL	What is also extraordinary about my tax plan is it gets rid of the payroll tax.
0637	PAUL	Democrats demagogue this issue to death, and when they do they say, oh, a millionaire would get a bigger tax cut than someone making $10,000.
0638	PAUL	That's proportionality, as Ben is trying to explain to folks.
0639	PAUL	But the thing is, is if we get rid of the payroll tax, everybody is going to get a tax cut.
0640	PAUL	And this is something that I think the public at large will support and could win an election.
0641	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0642	CAVUTO	There are no deductions on your  under your plan?
0643	PAUL	Ours is 14.5 percent for corporations, 14.5 percent for individuals.
0644	PAUL	No payroll tax for the employee.
0645	PAUL	The business tax pays for social security, and there would be two remaining deductions  home mortgage and charity.
0646	CAVUTO	Thank you, Senator.
0647	PAUL	Thank you.

0649	BARTIROMO	Senator Cruz, there isn't anyone in this audience or watching at home tonight who would not like to pay less in taxes.
0650	BARTIROMO	Most people just want a fair shake, and they don't want their money to be wasted.
0651	BARTIROMO	But explain how your plan works.
0652	BARTIROMO	How can you cut taxes as much as you propose without running up debt and deficits?
0653	CRUZ	Well, sure, you put your finger on what the problem is.
0654	CRUZ	The current system isn't fair.
0655	CRUZ	Washington is fundamentally corrupt.
0656	CRUZ	There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible  and  and not a one of them is as good.
0657	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0658	CRUZ	Every one of them reflects a carveout or a subsidy, and it's all about empowering the Washington cartel.
0659	CRUZ	My simple Flat Tax says that, for a family of four, for the first $36,000 you earn, you pay no taxes whatsoever.
0660	CRUZ	No income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing.
0661	CRUZ	Above that, every American pays 10 percent across the board  a flat, fair tax.
0662	CRUZ	Which means that no longer do you have hedgefund billionaires paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries.
0663	CRUZ	On the business side, I've got a business flat tax of 16 percent  again, that applies across the board.
0664	CRUZ	Right now, with our corporate income tax, giant corporations with armies of accountants regularly are paying little to no taxes while small businesses are getting hammered.
0665	CRUZ	This is fair and acrosstheboard.
0666	CRUZ	Now, you ask, how do the numbers add up?
0667	CRUZ	I would encourage folks, if you go to our website, tedcruz.org, we have the specific numbers on the website.
0668	CRUZ	This plan eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax, eliminates the corporate income tax, and it abolishes the IRS.
0669	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0670	CRUZ	And the effect of that is incredible economic growth.
0671	CRUZ	It means every income group will see doubledigit increases, from the very poorest to the very weakest, of at least 14 percent.
0672	CRUZ	So if you're a single mom, if you're making $40,000 a year, what that means is an extra about $5,000 in your pocket to provide for your kids, to make ends meet.
0673	CRUZ	It has a powerful, powerful effect.
0674	CRUZ	And there's one other really powerful feature of my plan, which is that it's borderadjustable.
0675	CRUZ	Which means, if you're an exporter  if you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you're a manufacturer, you don't pay the businesses flat tax.
0676	CRUZ	Exports are free of that tax, but all imports pay that 16 percent business flat tax, which means this tax plan would cause jobs to boom, and it would let America compete with China and the world on a level playing field.
0677	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0678	BARTIROMO	But you haven't told us how to pay for it.
0679	CRUZ	Well, the numbers the Tax Foundation had put out is that the static cost of the plan is $3.6 trillion over 10 years, but the dynamic cost of the plan, which  which is the cost that factors in growth, is about $768 billion.
0680	CRUZ	It is less than a trillion.
0681	CRUZ	It costs less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth and it's one of the very few plans that abolishes the IRS.
0682	CRUZ	But on top of that, today, we rolled out a spending plan.
0683	CRUZ	$500 billion in specific cuts  five major agencies that I would eliminate.
0684	CRUZ	The IRS, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, and HUD  and then 25 specific programs.
0685	CRUZ	Again, that's on our website at tedcruz.org.
0686	CRUZ	You want to look at specificity?
0687	CRUZ	It's easy for everyone to say, "cut spending".
0688	CRUZ	It's much harder and riskier to put out, chapter and verse, specifically the programs you would cut to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids.
0689	BARTIROMO	Thank you, Senator.
0690	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0691	BARTIROMO	Governor Bush, Republican primary voters say tax reform should be a priority for Congress and the administration.
0692	BARTIROMO	But, Governor Bush, how important is tax reform in your domestic policy agenda?
0693	BARTIROMO	Will you guarantee it in the first year of your presidency?
0694	BUSH	I'm gonna fight as hard as I can to make sure that we shift power away from Washington, simplify the tax code, to spur economic activity in this country.
0695	BUSH	Of course it's the highest priority.
0696	BUSH	If we don't do that, we're stuck with the "new normal" of 2 percent growth.
0697	BUSH	Hillary Clinton says, basically, we just gotta get used to it.
0698	BUSH	Two percent growth means declining income for the middle class.
0699	BUSH	It means more than 6 million people are stuck in poverty than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated.
0700	BUSH	It means  it means more demands on government  growing the economy is the first job, if we're going to be serious about dealing with the deficit and debt.
0701	BUSH	And more importantly, people are really struggling right now.
0702	BUSH	In this economy, the disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks.
0703	BUSH	So yeah, we've created jobs, your  argue (ph)  brought that up early, and it was a good question.
0704	BUSH	Jobs are being created, but they're lowerincome jobs than the jobs that were lost.
0705	BUSH	And the net effect of this is we need to jumpstart the economy.
0706	BUSH	I think of Jonathan (ph) and Reagan Love (ph), who are supporters of mine.
0707	BUSH	Jonathan has been deployed by the National Guard, he is  he's in Oklahoma.
0708	BUSH	Reagan Love  by the way, pretty great name, I think  is a teacher.
0709	BUSH	When  if they had this tax cut, what they told me was that that $2,300 of money in their pocket  they would go back to South Carolina and start a business.
0710	BUSH	Imagine what it would be like, instead of having more businesses closed than started, we had it the exact opposite.
0711	BUSH	We would grow our economy, and the government would get the revenue necessary to make things  make things better.
0712	BUSH	Hillary Clinton's approach to this is more topdown, more regulation, more taxes, more government, and it will destroy our economy.

0715	BAKER	Senator Rubio.
0716	BAKER	Can I just come to Senator Rubio?
0717	BAKER	We're coming to you, Mr. Trump, in one second.
0718	BAKER	I  I promise.
0719	TRUMP	Yes.
0720	BAKER	Senator Rubio, your tax plan includes a large expansion of child tax credits to raise off (ph) the tax incomes for lowincome parents.
0721	BAKER	A similar tax credit that you previously proposed in the Senate was estimated to cost as much as $170 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation.
0722	BAKER	Isn't  isn't there a risk you're just adding another expensive entitle program to an already overburdened federal budget?
0723	RUBIO	The most important job I'm ever going to have, the most important job anyone in this room will ever have, is the job of being a parent.
0724	RUBIO	Not the job of being president, or the job of being a senator, or the job of being a congressman.
0725	RUBIO	The most important job any of us will ever do is the job of being a president (sic), because the most important institution in society is the family.
0726	RUBIO	If the family breaks down, society breaks down.
0727	RUBIO	You can't have a strong nation without strong values, and no one is born with strong values.
0728	RUBIO	They have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities.
0729	RUBIO	And so when we set out to do tax reform, we endeavor to have a profamily tax code, and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living.
0730	RUBIO	It is expensive to raise children in the 21st century, and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the United States, and everything costs more.
0731	RUBIO	In 35 out of 50 states, child care costs more than college.
0732	RUBIO	There are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what I'm talking about.
0733	RUBIO	They don't know how they're going to make that payment every month, and if they can't make it, they can't work, because someone needs to watch their kids during the day.
0734	RUBIO	They don't know how they're going to save for their kids' future, to go to college.
0735	RUBIO	And so, yes, I have a child tax credit increase, and I'm proud of it.
0736	RUBIO	I am proud that I have a profamily tax code, because the pro family tax plan I have will strengthen the most important institution in the  in the country, the family.
0737	PAUL	Neil, there's a point I'd like to make here...
0738	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0739	PAUL	....Neil, a point that I'd like to make about the tax credits.
0740	PAUL	We have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative.
0741	PAUL	Is it fiscally conservative to have a trilliondollar expenditure?
0742	PAUL	We're not talking about giving people back their tax money.
0743	PAUL	He's talking about giving people money they didn't pay.
0744	PAUL	It's a welfare transfer payment.
0745	PAUL	So here's what we have.
0746	PAUL	Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments  a new welfare program that's a refundable tax credit?
0747	PAUL	Add that to Marco's plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative.

0760	RUBIO	He's talking about my tax plan.
0761	BAKER	Please.
0762	RUBIO	So let me begin with this.
0763	RUBIO	I actually believe  first of all, this is their money.
0764	RUBIO	They do pay.
0765	RUBIO	It is refundable, not just against the taxes they pay to the government, but also the  on their federal income tax, it's refundable against the payroll tax.
0766	RUBIO	Everyone pays payroll tax.
0767	RUBIO	This is their money.
0768	RUBIO	This is not our money.
0769	RUBIO	And here's what I don't understand  if you invest that money in a piece of equipment, if you invest that money in a business, you get to write it off your taxes.
0770	RUBIO	But if you invest it in your children, in the future of America and strengthening your family, we're not going to recognize that in our tax code?
0771	RUBIO	The family is the most important institution in society.
0772	RUBIO	And, yes...
0773	PAUL	Nevertheless, it's not very conservative, Marco.
0774	RUBIO	...
0775	RUBIO	I do want to rebuild the American military.
0776	PAUL	How is it conservative?
0777	RUBIO	I know that Rand is a committed isolationist.
0778	RUBIO	I'm not.
0779	RUBIO	I believe the world is a stronger and a better place, when the United States is the strongest military power in the world.
0780	PAUL	Yeah, but, Marco!
0781	PAUL	Marco!
0782	PAUL	How is it conservative, how is it conservative to add a trilliondollar expenditure for the federal government that you're not paying for?
0783	RUBIO	Because...
0784	PAUL	How is it conservative?
0785	RUBIO	...are you talking about the military, Rand?
0786	PAUL	How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?
0787	PAUL	You can not be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for.
0788	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0789	RUBIO	We can't even have an economy if we're not safe.

0797	PAUL	As we go further, and further into debt, we become less, and less safe.
0798	PAUL	This is the most important thing we're going to talk about tonight.
0799	PAUL	Can you be a conservative, and be liberal on military spending?
0800	PAUL	Can you be for unlimited military spending, and say, Oh, I'm going to make the country safe?
0801	PAUL	No, we need a safe country, but, you know, we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined?
0802	PAUL	I want a strong national defense, but I don't want us to be bankrupt.

0804	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0805	CRUZ	...Middle ground that brings both of these together...
0806	FIORINA	...Yes, the middle ground is this...
0807	CRUZ	...Exactly right, that we have to defend this nation.
0808	CRUZ	You think defending this nation is expensive, try not defending it.
0809	CRUZ	That's a lot more expensive.
0810	SYSTEM	[ applause and cheering ]
0811	CRUZ	But, you can do that, and pay for it.
0812	CRUZ	You can do that, and also be fiscally responsible.
0813	CRUZ	You know, I mention that the 25 programs that I put today, that I would eliminate them.
0814	CRUZ	Among them are corporate welfare, like sugar subsidies.
0815	CRUZ	Let's take that as an example.
0816	CRUZ	Sugar subsidies.
0817	CRUZ	Sugar farmers farm under...
0818	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0819	CRUZ	...under roughly 0.2% of the farmland in America, and yet they give 40% of the lobbying money.
0820	CRUZ	That sort of corporate welfare is why we're bankrupting our kids, and grandkids.
0821	CRUZ	I would end those subsidies to pay for defending this nation...
0822	BAKER	...Gentleman, we need to move on...
0823	FIORINA	...This is why  this is why we must combine, actually, zerobased budgeting with tax reform because unless we can examine, and cut, and move, every single dollar of discretionary spending in the federal government, we cannot reform taxes and reduce spending at the same time.
0824	FIORINA	Ask yourself this question, how is it possible that the federal government gets more money each and every year, which the federal government has been doing, receiving more money every year for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike, and yet, never has enough money to do the important things?
0825	FIORINA	The answer?
0826	FIORINA	All the money's always spoken for.
0827	FIORINA	All the money's spoken for.
0828	FIORINA	So, we have to go to zerobased budgeting, which is a simple idea  by the way, there's been a bill for zerosbased (ph) budgeting...
0829	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0830	FIORINA	...It exists, it can be voted on.
0831	FIORINA	Every dollar must be examined.
0832	FIORINA	Any dollar can be cut.
0833	FIORINA	Any dollar can be cut, any dollar can be moved.
0834	FIORINA	We have to go to a three page tax code.
0835	FIORINA	You lower every rate, you close every loophole, why?
0836	FIORINA	Because the government uses the tax code to decide winners, and losers.
0837	FIORINA	You have to strip the corruption out of the tax code to pay for it.
0838	FIORINA	You have to know where every single dollar is being spent...
0839	BAKER	...We need to move...
0840	FIORINA	...Cut where you need to, and invest where you need to...
0841	BAKER	...We need too...
0842	FIORINA	...The two go hand in hand...
0843	BAKER	...We do need to move on.
0844	BAKER	Mr. Trump...
0845	TRUMP	Please, if I could just...
0846	BAKER	...Very quick.
0847	TRUMP	We have to make our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before so that nobody messes with us, and a long run, it's going to save us.
0848	TRUMP	I agree with Marco, I agree with Ted, we have no choice.
0849	TRUMP	And, I can tell you this with certainty.
0850	TRUMP	We all have a different tax plan.
0851	TRUMP	Some I don't totally agree with.

0863	KASICH	...Yes, sir...
0864	BAKER	...Mr. Trump, can I ask you about...
0865	TRUMP	...Yes...
0866	BAKER	...the U.S. just concluded an international trade agreement with 11 countries in the Pacific.
0867	BAKER	You've said that you'd rather have no deal...
0868	TRUMP	...Yeah...
0869	BAKER	...than sign the one that's on the table...
0870	TRUMP	...It's a horrible deal...
0871	BAKER	...Most economists  most economists say that trade is boosted growth, and every single post war president has supported the expansion of international trade, including the last three republican presidents.
0872	BAKER	Why would you reverse more than 50 years of U.S. trade policy?
0873	TRUMP	The TPP is horrible deal.
0874	TRUMP	It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble.
0875	TRUMP	It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.
0876	TRUMP	It's 5,600 pages long.
0877	TRUMP	So complex that nobodies read it.
0878	TRUMP	It's like Obamacare nobody ever read it.
0879	TRUMP	They passed it nobody read it.
0880	TRUMP	And look at mess we have right now.
0881	TRUMP	And it will be repealed.
0882	TRUMP	But this is one of the worst trade deals.
0883	TRUMP	And I would, yes, rather not have it.
0884	TRUMP	With all of these countries, and all of the bad ones getting advantage and taking advantage of what the good ones would normally get, I'd rather make individual deals with individual countries.
0885	TRUMP	We will do much better.
0886	TRUMP	We lose a fortune on trade.
0887	TRUMP	The United States loses with everybody.
0888	TRUMP	We're losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China, $75 billion a year imbalance with Japan.
0889	TRUMP	By the way, Mexico, $50 billion a year imbalance.
0890	TRUMP	So I must say, Gerard, I just think it's a terrible deal.
0891	TRUMP	I love trade.
0892	TRUMP	I'm a free trader, 100 percent.
0893	TRUMP	But we need smart people making the deals, and we don't have smart people making the deals.
0894	BAKER	The  the deal, as you say, the terms of the deal were published  were published just last week, the details, 5,000 pages of it, and 80 percent of U.S. trade with countries in the Pacific, these countries, these 11 countries, is actually tarifffree, and these  the trade deal only affects the other 20 percent.
0895	BAKER	Which  are there particular parts of the deal that you think were badly negotiated?
0896	TRUMP	Yes.
0897	TRUMP	Well, the currency manipulation they don't discuss in the agreement, which is a disaster.
0898	TRUMP	If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States  China in particular, because they're so good.
0899	TRUMP	It's the numberone abuser of this country.
0900	TRUMP	And if you look at the way they take advantage, it's through currency manipulation.
0901	TRUMP	It's not even discussed in the almost 6,000page agreement.
0902	TRUMP	It's not even discussed.
0903	BAKER	There was a separate  separate...
0904	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0905	TRUMP	And as you understand, I mean, you understand very well from the Wall Street Journal, currency manipulation is the single great weapon people have.
0906	TRUMP	They don't even discuss it in this agreement.
0907	TRUMP	So I say, it's a very bad deal, should not be approved.
0908	TRUMP	If it is approved, it will just be more bad trade deals, more loss of jobs for our country.
0909	TRUMP	We are losing jobs like nobody's ever lost jobs before.
0910	TRUMP	I want to bring jobs back into this country.
0911	PAUL	Hey, Gerard, you know, we might want to point out China is not part of this deal.
0912	UNKNOWN	True.
0913	UNKNOWN	It's true.
0914	BARTIROMO	That's right.
0915	BARTIROMO	That's right.
0916	PAUL	Before we get a little bit offkilter here...
0917	BAKER	But isn't that  isn't that part of the problem?
0918	BAKER	When I say, Senator, that if  if this deal is not ratified by  by the U.S.  by the Senate, then it would actually give China an opportunity to grow its economic leadership, which it's been seeking to do?
0919	BAKER	And if the U.S. is unable to take part in this trade deal with these countries in Asia, China will take the lead?
0920	PAUL	There is an argument that China doesn't like the deal, because in us doing the deal, we'll be trading with their competitors.
0921	PAUL	You're exactly right.
0922	PAUL	But I think we've sort of missed the point a little bit here.
0923	PAUL	There is an important point, though, about how we discuss these trade treaties that I do agree with Mr. Trump on.
0924	PAUL	We should negotiate from a position of strength.
0925	PAUL	And we also should negotiate using the full force and the constitutional power that was given to us.
0926	PAUL	I think it's a mistake that we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals.
0927	PAUL	We give up the power to filibuster, and I'm kind of fond of that power.

0929	PAUL	We give up the power to amend.
0930	PAUL	And I think, really, one of the big problems we have in our country is, over the last century, really, so much power has gravitated to the executive branch.
0931	PAUL	Really, Congress is kind of a bystander.
0932	PAUL	We don't write the rules.
0933	PAUL	We don't make the laws.
0934	PAUL	The executive branch does.
0935	PAUL	So even in trade  and I am for trade  I think we should be careful about giving so much power to the presidency.

0939	BARTIROMO	Coming up, the biggest threats facing the next commanderinchief.
0940	BARTIROMO	You're watching the Republican presidential debate, live tonight from Milwaukee.
0941	BARTIROMO	We'll be right back.
0942	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0943	BARTIROMO	Welcome back.
0944	BARTIROMO	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate.
0945	BARTIROMO	The candidates taking the questions you want answered.
0946	BARTIROMO	Also tonight, you can see what America is saying about the debate.
0947	BARTIROMO	Go to Facebook and type #gopdebate into the search box.
0948	BARTIROMO	Now, back to the questions.
0949	BARTIROMO	Americans face security threats at home and abroad.
0950	BARTIROMO	Last year, terrorist attacks rose 61 percent, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, with the most deaths occurring in just five countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria.
0951	BARTIROMO	Dr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan.
0952	BARTIROMO	Do you support the president's decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?
0953	CARSON	Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they  that's why they're called special ops, they're actually able to guide some of the other things that we're doing there.
0954	CARSON	And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East.
0955	CARSON	This is going to be his base.
0956	CARSON	And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.
0957	CARSON	We also must recognize that it's a very complex place.
0958	CARSON	You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.
0959	CARSON	What we've been doing so far is very ineffective, but we can't give up ground right there.
0960	CARSON	But we have to look at this on a much more global scale.
0961	CARSON	We're talking about global jihadists.
0962	CARSON	And their desire is to destroy us and to destroy our way of life.
0963	CARSON	So we have to be saying, how do we make them look like losers?
0964	CARSON	Because that's the way that they're able to gather a lot of influence.
0965	CARSON	And I think in order to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate.
0966	CARSON	And you look for the easiest place to do that?
0967	CARSON	It would be in Iraq.
0968	CARSON	And if  outside of Anbar in Iraq, there's a big energy field.
0969	CARSON	Take that from them.
0970	CARSON	Take all of that land from them.
0971	CARSON	We could do that, I believe, fairly easily, I've learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.
0972	CARSON	But you have to continue to face them, because our goal is not to contain them, but to destroy them before they destroy us.
0973	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0974	BARTIROMO	We asked Facebook to take a look at some of the major issues we're talking about, and tackling in this debate tonight.
0975	BARTIROMO	This word cloud shows what people are focusing on the most.
0976	BARTIROMO	The bigger the word, the more the talk.
0977	BARTIROMO	One of the most discussed issues in the last month, homeland security.
0978	BARTIROMO	Governor Bush, what is the biggest threat facing America today?
0979	BUSH	It is  I'd say it is Islamic terrorism, and, back to the question of what we are dealing with in Iraq, when we pull back voids are filled.
0980	BUSH	That's the lesson of history, and, sadly, this president does not believe in American leadership.
0981	BUSH	He does not believe it, and the net result is that we have a caliphate the size of Indiana that gains energy each and everyday to recruit Americans in our own country, and the threat to the homeland relates to the fact that we have not dealt with this threat of terror in the Middle East.
0982	BUSH	We should have a no fly zone in Syria.
0983	BUSH	We should have a support for the remnants of the Syrian Free Army, and create safe zones.
0984	BUSH	If you want to deal with the four million refugees that are leaving Syria because of the devastation there, then we 'ought to create safe zones for them to stay in the region rather than go to Europe.
0985	BUSH	And, that requires American leadership.
0986	BUSH	Without American leadership every other country in the neighborhood beings to change their priorities.
0987	BUSH	It is tragic that you see Iraq, and other countries now talking to Russia.
0988	BUSH	It wasn't that long ago that Russia had no influence in the region at all.
0989	BUSH	And, so, the United States needs to lead across the board.
0990	BUSH	This president, and Hillary Clinton both do not believe the United States has a leadership role to play, and we're now paying a price, and it will have a huge impact on the economy of this country if we don't deal with this.
0991	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0992	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
0993	BARTIROMO	Mr. Trump, in 2012 debate, President Obama mocked Mitt Romney's assertion that Russia was the top geopolitical challenge facing the United States, saying he was a Cold War dinosaur.
0994	BARTIROMO	Now, Russia has invaded Ukraine, and has put troops in Syria.
0995	BARTIROMO	You have said you will have a good relationship with Mr. Putin.
0996	BARTIROMO	So, what does President Trump do in response to Russia's aggression?
0997	TRUMP	Well, first of all, it's not only Russia.
0998	TRUMP	We have problems with North Korea where they actually have nuclear weapons.
0999	TRUMP	You know, nobody talks about it, we talk about Iran, and that's one of the worst deals ever made.
1000	TRUMP	One of the worst contracts ever signed, ever, in anything, and it's a disgrace.
1001	TRUMP	But, we have somebody over there, a madman, who already has nuclear weapons we don't talk about that.
1002	TRUMP	That's a problem.
1003	TRUMP	China is a problem, both economically in what they're doing in the South China Sea, I mean, they are becoming a very, very major force.
1004	TRUMP	So, we have more than just Russia.
1005	TRUMP	But, as far as the Ukraine is concerned, and you could Syria  as far as Syria, I like  if Putin wants to go in, and I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes, we were stablemates, and we did very well that night.
1006	TRUMP	But, you know that.
1007	TRUMP	But, if Putin wants to go and knocked the hell out of ISIS, I am all for it, 100%, and I can't understand how anybody would be against it...
1008	BUSH	...They're not doing that...
1009	TRUMP	...They blew up  hold it....
1010	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1011	TRUMP	...They blew up, wait a minute...
1012	SYSTEM	[ audience reaction ]
1013	TRUMP	...They blew up a Russian airplane.
1014	TRUMP	He cannot be in love with these people.
1015	TRUMP	He's going in, and we can go in, and everybody should go in.
1016	TRUMP	As far as the Ukraine is concerned, we have a group of people, and a group of countries, including Germany  tremendous economic behemoth  why are we always doing the work?
1017	TRUMP	We are  I'm all for protecting Ukraine and working  but, we have countries that are surrounding the Ukraine that aren't doing anything.
1018	TRUMP	They say, "Keep going, keep going, you dummies, keep going.
1019	TRUMP	Protect us..."
1020	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1021	TRUMP	...And we have to get smart.
1022	TRUMP	We can't continue to be the policeman of the world.
1023	TRUMP	We are $19 trillion dollars, we have a country that's going to hell, we have an infrastructure that's falling apart.
1024	TRUMP	Our roads, our bridges, our schools, our airports, and we have to start investing money in our country.
1025	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1026	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
1027	BUSH	Donald  Donald's wrong on this.
1028	BUSH	He is absolutely wrong on this.
1029	BUSH	We're not going to be the world's policeman, but we sure as heck better be the world's leader.
1030	BUSH	That's  there's a huge difference where, without us leading...
1031	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]
1032	BUSH	...voids are filled, and the idea that it's a good idea for Putin to be in Syria, let ISIS take out Assad, and then Putin will take out ISIS?
1033	BUSH	I mean, that's like a board game, that's like playing Monopoly or something.
1034	BUSH	That's not how the real world works.
1035	BUSH	We have to lead, we have to be involved.
1036	BUSH	We should have a no fly zone in Syria.
1037	BUSH	There are  they are barrel bombing the innocents in that country.
1038	BUSH	If you're a Christian, increasingly in Lebanon, or Iraq, or Syria, you're going to be beheaded.
1039	BUSH	And, if you're a moderate Islamist, you're not going to be able to survive either.
1040	BUSH	We have to play a role in this be able to bring the rest of the world to this issue before it's too late.
1041	TRUMP	Assad is a bad guy, but we have no idea who the socalled rebels  I read about the rebels, nobody even knows who they are.
1042	TRUMP	I spoke to a general two weeks ago, he said  he was very up on exactly what we're talking about.
1043	TRUMP	He said, "You know, Mr. Trump?
1044	TRUMP	We're giving hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment to these people, we have no idea who they are."
1045	TRUMP	So, I don't like Assad.
1046	TRUMP	Who's going to like Assad?
1047	TRUMP	But, we have no idea who these people, and what they're going to be, and what they're going to represent.
1048	TRUMP	They may be far worse than Assad.
1049	TRUMP	Look at Libya.
1050	TRUMP	Look at Iraq.
1051	TRUMP	Look at the mess we have after spending $2 trillion dollars, thousands of lives, wounded warriors all over the place  who I love, OK?
1052	TRUMP	All over.
1053	TRUMP	We have nothing.
1054	TRUMP	And, I said, keep the oil.
1055	TRUMP	And we should have kept the oil, believe me.
1056	TRUMP	We should have kept the oil.
1057	TRUMP	And, you know what?
1058	TRUMP	We should have given the oil...
1059	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1060	TRUMP	..We should've given big chunks to the people that lost their arms, their legs, and their families, and their sons, and daughters, because right now, you know who has a lot of that oil?
1061	TRUMP	Iran, and ISIS.
1062	FIORINA	You know, Mr. Trump fancies himself a very good negotiator.
1063	FIORINA	And, I accept that he's done a lot of good deals, so, Mr. Trump 'ought to know that we should not speak to people from a position of weakness.
1064	FIORINA	Senator Paul should know that as well.
1065	FIORINA	One of the reasons I've said that I would not be talking to Vladimir Putin right now, although I have met him as well, not in a green room for a show, but in a private meeting.
1066	SYSTEM	[ laughter, applause, and cheering ]
1067	FIORINA	One of the reasons I've said I wouldn't be talking to Vladimir Putin right now is because we are speaking to him from a position of weakness brought on by this administration, so, I wouldn't talk to him for awhile, but, I would do this.
1068	FIORINA	I would start rebuilding the Sixth Fleet right under his nose, rebuilding the military  the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose.
1069	FIORINA	I would conduct very aggressive military exercises in the Baltic States so that he understood we would protect our NATO allies...
1070	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1071	FIORINA	...and I might also put in a few more thousand troops into Germany, not to start a war, but to make sure that Putin understand that the United States of America will stand with our allies.
1072	FIORINA	That is why Governor Bush is correct.
1073	FIORINA	We must have a no fly zone in Syria because Russia cannot tell the United States of America where and when to fly our planes.
1074	FIORINA	We also have a set of allies...
1075	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1076	FIORINA	...We also have a set of allies in the Arab Middle East that know that ISIS is their fight.
1077	FIORINA	They have asked us specifically over, and over again to support them.
1078	FIORINA	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a very long time, has asked us for bombs and material, we have not provided it.
1079	FIORINA	The Egyptians are asking us to share intelligence, we are not, I will.
1080	FIORINA	The Kurds have asked us to arm them for three years, we are not, I would.
1081	FIORINA	The Egyptians, the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Bahrain's, the Emirati, the Kurds...
1082	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1083	FIORINA	...all of these, I know, by the way, understand ISIS is their fight, but they must see leadership support and resolve from the United States of America...
1084	UNKNOWN	...let me follow up that...
1085	FIORINA	...we have the strongest military on the face of the planet, and everyone has to know it.
1086	CAVUTO	Senator Paul...
1087	SYSTEM	[ applause and cheering ]
1088	CAVUTO	Senator Paul, you have already said, sir, that that would be a mistake in not talking to Vladimir Putin, or to rule it out.
1089	CAVUTO	You've argued that it's never a good idea to close down communication.
1090	CAVUTO	With that in mind, do you think the same applies to administration efforts right now to include the Iranians in talks on Syria?
1091	PAUL	I'd like first to respond to the acquisition, we should  I think it's particularly naive, particularly foolish to think that we're not going to talk to Russia.
1092	PAUL	The idea of a no fly zone, realize that this is also something that Hillary Clinton agrees with several on our side with, you're asking for a no fly zone in an area in which Russia already flies.
1093	PAUL	Russia flies in that zone at the invitation of Iraq.
1094	PAUL	I'm not saying it's a good thing, but you better know at least what we're getting into.
1095	PAUL	So, when you think it's going to be a good idea to have a no fly zone over Iraq, realize that means you are saying we are going to shoot down Russian planes.
1096	PAUL	If you're ready for that, be ready to send your sons and daughters to another war in Iraq.
1097	PAUL	I don't want to see that happen.
1098	PAUL	I think the first war in Iraq was a mistake...
1099	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1100	PAUL	You can be strong without being involved in every civil war around the war...
1101	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1102	CAVUTO	...Well, then how would you respond?
1103	PAUL	Ronald Reagan was strong, but Ronald Reagan didn't...
1104	FIORINA	...Ronald Reagan walked away at Reykjavik.
1105	PAUL	...send troops into the Middle East...
1106	FIORINA	...he walked away, he quit talks...
1107	PAUL	...Can I finish...
1108	FIORINA	...when it was time to quit talking...
1109	PAUL	...Can I finish my time?
1110	PAUL	Could I finish with my time?
1111	TRUMP	Why does she keep interrupting everybody?
1112	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1113	TRUMP	Terrible.
1114	SYSTEM	[ booing ]
1115	PAUL	Yes, I would like to finish my response, basically.
1116	RUBIO	You know, if I may respond...
1117	PAUL	This is an important question.
1118	PAUL	This is an incredibly important question.
1119	PAUL	And the question goes to be, who do we want to be our commanderinchief?
1120	PAUL	Do you want a commanderinchief who says something that we never did throughout the entire Cold War, to discontinue having conversations with the Russians?
1121	PAUL	I am not happy about them flying over there.
1122	PAUL	But I'm not naive enough to say, well, Iraq has them flying over their airspace, we're just going to announce that we're shooting them down?
1123	PAUL	That is naive to the point of being something you might hear in junior high.
1124	PAUL	But it's scary...
1125	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1126	CAVUTO	But if you're not going to respond in a nofly zone strategy, what would yours be?
1127	PAUL	The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies.
1128	PAUL	I wouldn't arm ISIS.
1129	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1130	PAUL	Most of the people who want to the nofly zone also favored arming the allies of al Qaeda, which became ISIS.
1131	PAUL	That was the dumbest, most foolhardy notion.
1132	PAUL	And most of the people up here supported it.
1133	PAUL	They wanted to arm the allies of al Qaeda.
1134	PAUL	Some of them still do.
1135	PAUL	That's how ISIS grew.
1136	PAUL	We pushed back Assad, and ISIS was allowed to grow in the vacuum.
1137	PAUL	So the first thing you do is don't arm your enemies.
1138	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1139	RUBIO	I need to add a couple of points to this.
1140	RUBIO	The first is, I've never met Vladimir Putin, but I know enough about him to know he is a gangster.
1141	RUBIO	He is basically an organized crime figure that runs a country, controls a $2 trillion economy.
1142	RUBIO	And is using to build up his military in a rapid way despite the fact his economy is a disaster.
1143	RUBIO	He understands only geopolitical strength.
1144	RUBIO	And every time he has acted anywhere in the world, whether it's in Ukraine or Georgia before that, or now in the Middle East, it's because he is trusting in weakness.
1145	RUBIO	His calculation in the Middle East is that he has seen what this president has done, which is nothing, the president has no strategy, our allies in the region do not trust us.
1146	RUBIO	For goodness sake, there is only one proAmerican free enterprise democracy in the Middle East, it is the state of Israel.
1147	RUBIO	And we have a president that treats the prime minister of Israel with less respect than what he gives the ayatollah in Iran.
1148	RUBIO	And so our allies in the region don't trust us.
1149	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1150	RUBIO	Vladimir Putin is exploiting that weakness, for purposes of edging the Americans out as the most important geopolitical power broker in the region.
1151	RUBIO	And we do have a vested interest.
1152	RUBIO	And here's why.
1153	RUBIO	Because all those radical terrorist groups that, by the way, are not just in Syria and in Iraq, ISIS is now in Libya.
1154	RUBIO	They are a significant presence in Libya, and in Afghanistan, and a growing presence in Pakistan.
1155	RUBIO	Soon they will be in Turkey.
1156	RUBIO	They will try Jordan.
1157	RUBIO	They will try Saudi Arabia.
1158	RUBIO	They are coming to us.
1159	RUBIO	They recruit Americans using social media.
1160	RUBIO	And they don't hate us simply because we support Israel.
1161	RUBIO	They hate us because of our values.
1162	RUBIO	They hate us because our girls go to school.
1163	RUBIO	They hate us because women drive in the United States.
1164	RUBIO	Either they win or we win, and we had better take this risk seriously, it is not going away on its own.
1165	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1166	BAKER	Thank you, Senator.
1167	BAKER	Governor Kasich, I want to ask you about China, in particular hundreds of American companies have been subjected to cyber attacks from the Chinese military, yet statebacked Chinese companies, growing their presence in the United States, Chinese investments in U.S., which were nearly nonexistent a few years ago, are now over $50 billion.
1168	BAKER	And as my newspaper recently reported, Chinese companies are planning to bid for one of the largest hotel chains in the United States, what would be the largest ever Chinese takeover of a U.S. company.
1169	BAKER	Would you stop them?
1170	KASICH	Let me tell you this, Mr. Baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us.
1171	KASICH	I want to give you a little trip around the world.
1172	KASICH	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years.
1173	KASICH	In the Ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves.
1174	KASICH	In the eastern part of Europe, make sure that Finland and the Baltics know that if the Russians move, we move.
1175	KASICH	In Syria, yes, a nofly zone in the north on the Turkish border, a nofly zone on the south on the Jordanian border.
1176	KASICH	Anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out.
1177	KASICH	They fly in there a second time, they will not fly out.
1178	KASICH	And it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be.
1179	KASICH	And it also sends many messages in the Middle East that we're still involved.
1180	KASICH	Saudi Arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us.
1181	KASICH	But they're fundamentally our friends.
1182	KASICH	Jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years.
1183	KASICH	Egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the Middle East throughout their history.
1184	KASICH	In the groups  in the countries of the Gulf states of Bahrain, the Cleveland Clinic is opening an operation.
1185	KASICH	Clearly we see the same with them.
1186	KASICH	And in Israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them.
1187	KASICH	And finally China, China doesn't own the South China Sea, and I give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the Chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more.
1188	KASICH	And in the trade agreement, the TPP, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the Chinese.
1189	KASICH	They are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend.
1190	KASICH	And finally, I will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics.
1191	KASICH	When the fall comes, and we run against Hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected.
1192	KASICH	I have two 16yearold girls, and I want this country to be strong.
1193	KASICH	We make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble.
1194	KASICH	We must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid.
1195	KASICH	I served in Washington as the chairman of the Budget Committee, and we got the budget balanced.
1196	KASICH	And in Ohio, as the CEO, and guess what, we have got to have a CEO mentality and a way to beat Hillary Clinton and the Democracies in the fall.
1197	KASICH	And our ideas have to add up.
1198	KASICH	They have to be solid.
1199	KASICH	And people have to know we have the confidence to lead America.
1200	KASICH	And as president, I will lead this country, as I have before in Washington and in Ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs.
1201	KASICH	And I appreciate the opportunity to speak this time, Gerry.

1212	BAKER	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, live from Milwaukee.
1213	BAKER	Now let's get straight back to the questions, and Governor Bush.
1214	BAKER	Governor, Hillary Clinton recently said that if we had another financial crisis like the one in 2008, she wouldn't bail out the banks.
1215	BAKER	Would you?
1216	BUSH	We're not  we shouldn't have another financial crisis.
1217	BUSH	What we ought to do is raise the capital requirements so banks aren't too big to fail.
1218	BUSH	DoddFrank has actually done the opposite, totally the opposite, where banks now have higher concentration of risk in assets and the capital requirements aren't high enough.
1219	BUSH	If we were serious about it, we would raise the capital requirements and lessen the load on the community banks and other financial institutions.
1220	BUSH	This vast overreach has created a huge problem for our country, and Hillary Clinton wants to double down on that.
1221	BUSH	I was in Washington, Iowa, about three months ago talking about how bad Washington, D.C., is.
1222	BUSH	It was  get the  kind of the  anyway.
1223	BUSH	We had...
1224	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1225	BUSH	It  and I talked to a banker there.
1226	BUSH	This is a bank that had $125 million of assets, four branches.
1227	BUSH	Their compliance costs because of DoddFrank went from $100,000 to $600,000 in a twoyear period.
1228	BUSH	The net effect of that is  and they had  they had not one loan that went bad during the financial crisis.
1229	BUSH	They knew  they knew their borrowers.
1230	BUSH	They gave back to the community.
1231	BUSH	They were engaged in the community.
1232	BUSH	And imagine America without its community banks.
1233	BUSH	Well, that's what's happening because of DoddFrank.
1234	BUSH	That's  that's my worry.
1235	BUSH	My worry is that the real economy has been hurt by the vast overreach of the Obama administration.
1236	BUSH	And Hillary Clinton, she wants to double down on that.
1237	BUSH	She wants to create even more so.
1238	BUSH	She is a captive of the left of her party to the point now where she is  she was for the trade agreement in  the Pacific agreement.
1239	BUSH	Now she's against it.
1240	BUSH	She was  hinted she was for the XL pipeline.
1241	BUSH	Now she's opposed to it.
1242	BUSH	All the things that would create sustained economic growth she's now doubling down against it.
1243	BAKER	But, Governor, but can I just quickly  did  you can't seriously guarantee that there won't be another financial crisis, can you?
1244	BUSH	You could, if you were serious about...
1245	BAKER	Ever?
1246	BAKER	There will never be another financial crisis?
1247	BUSH	No, I can't say that.
1248	BUSH	But I can say, if you created higher capital requirements, that's the solution to this, not having concentration of assets.
1249	BUSH	The bigger banks now have more and more control over  over the financial assets of this country.
1250	BUSH	And that is the wrong approach to take.
1251	BAKER	Dr. Carson, if I may, just on that point, despite measures taken, as the governor says, since the crisis to make the financial system safer, the major banks in the U.S., many of them are actually bigger than ever.
1252	BAKER	Asset held by JPMorgan Chase, for example, the very largest bank, have increased by nearly 40 percent to over $2.6 trillion.
1253	BAKER	Do you think JPMorgan and the other big banks should be broken up?
1254	CARSON	Well, I think we should have policies that don't allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities.
1255	CARSON	And certainly some of the policies, some of the monetary and Fed policies that we're using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially.
1256	CARSON	Those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place.
1257	CARSON	And I think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation.
1258	CARSON	This country was  declared its independence in 1776.
1259	CARSON	In less than 100 years, it was the numberone economic power in the world.
1260	CARSON	And the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk taking and capital investment.
1261	CARSON	Those are the fuels that drive it.
1262	CARSON	And what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives.
1263	CARSON	If we can get that out, it makes a big difference.
1264	CARSON	And even for the average person, every single regulation costs money.
1265	CARSON	And it's shifted to the individual.
1266	CARSON	So  and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich.
1267	CARSON	They go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it.
1268	CARSON	And the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it.
1269	CARSON	It is hurting the poor.
1270	CARSON	Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core.
1271	CARSON	They'll say it's the rich, take their money, but that won't help.
1272	CARSON	You can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem that we're having.
1273	CARSON	We have to come back to the fundamental principles that made America great.
1274	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1275	BAKER	But just to be clear, just  just to be clear, then, you wouldn't  you wouldn't favor breaking up the big banks?
1276	BAKER	You think they're big enough  they're OK as they are, as big as they are?
1277	CARSON	I would have policies that wouldn't allow that to occur.
1278	CARSON	I don't want to go in and tear anybody down.
1279	CARSON	I mean, that doesn't help us.
1280	CARSON	But what does help us is stop tinkering around the edges and fix the actual problems that exist that are creating the problem in the first place.
1281	BAKER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.
1282	RUBIO	Can I just add what  he's right on point there.
1283	RUBIO	Do you know why these banks are so big?
1284	RUBIO	The government made them big.
1285	RUBIO	The government made them big by adding thousands and thousands of pages of regulations.
1286	RUBIO	So the big banks, they have an army of lawyers, they have an army of compliance officers.
1287	RUBIO	They can deal with all these things.
1288	RUBIO	The small banks, like Governor Bush was saying, they can't deal with all these regulations.
1289	RUBIO	They can't deal with all  they cannot hire the fanciest law firm in Washington or the best lobbying firm to deal with all these regulations.
1290	RUBIO	And so the result is, the big banks get bigger, the small banks struggle to lend or even exist, and the result is what you have today.
1291	RUBIO	And in DoddFrank, you have actually codified too big to fail.
1292	RUBIO	We have actually created a category of systemically important institutions, and these banks go around bragging about it.
1293	RUBIO	You know what they say to people with a wink and a nod?
1294	RUBIO	We are so big, we are so important that if we get in trouble, the government has to bail us out.
1295	RUBIO	This is an outrage.
1296	RUBIO	We need to repeal DoddFrank as soon as possible.
1297	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1298	KASICH	Let me  let me also say, Gary  Gary, let me also say, Jeb is  what Jeb is talking about with the big banks is to force them to reserve their capital, people who invest it and they hold their capital, so that if the bank goes down, the people who are invested in the bank are the ones that pay.
1299	KASICH	That's what he's trying to say.
1300	KASICH	Secondly, I'll tell you about Wall Street There's too much greed.
1301	KASICH	And the fact is, a free enterprise system is a system that's produced the greatest wealth for the world.
1302	KASICH	But you know Michael Novak, the great Catholic theologian, says that a free enterprise system that is not underlaid with values  and we should all think about the way we conduct our lives  yes, free enterprise is great, profits are great, but there have to be some values that underlay it, and they need a good ethics lesson on Wall Street on a regular basis to keep them in check so we, the people, do not lose.
1303	BAKER	Thank you.
1304	PAUL	Gerard, can I comment...
1305	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1306	CAVUTO	Senator Cruz  and I will get to you  but, Senator Cruz, on that theme, Facebook data shows that over the last month alone, nearly 1 million people  nearly 1 million  have been concerned about reining in Wall Street, apparently believing that some have not been punished enough.
1307	CAVUTO	So, as an accomplished litigator yourself and a former solicitor general, would you go after the very people who believe and fear that Wall Street has ignored, in other words, the crooks that Bernie Sanders say have gotten away with a financial murder?
1308	CRUZ	Absolutely yes.
1309	CRUZ	You know, I have spent much of my adult life enforcing the law and defending the Constitution.
1310	CRUZ	And the problem that underlies all of this is the cronyism and corruption of Washington.
1311	CRUZ	You know, the opening question Jerry asked, would you bail out the big banks again?
1312	CRUZ	Nobody gave you an answer to that.
1313	CRUZ	I'll give you an answer.
1314	CRUZ	Absolutely not.
1315	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1316	CRUZ	And what we have right now is we have Washington  as government gets bigger and bigger, you know, the biggest lie in all of Washington and in all of politics is that Republicans are the party of the rich.
1317	CRUZ	The truth is, the rich do great with big government.
1318	CRUZ	They get in bed with big government.
1319	CRUZ	The big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger under DoddFrank and community banks are going out of business.
1320	CRUZ	And, by the way, the consequence of that is small businesses can't get business loans, and it is that fundamental corruption that is why six of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are in and around Washington, D.C.
1321	CRUZ	And let me give you a contrast to Washington cronyism.
1322	CRUZ	Some weeks ago, a woman named Sabina Loving testified at a hearing that I chaired in the Senate.
1323	CRUZ	Sabina Loving is an AfricanAmerican single mom who started a tax preparation business in the south side of Chicago.
1324	CRUZ	She found a store front, she wanted to have her own business.
1325	CRUZ	She started a business.
1326	CRUZ	But then the IRS promulgated new regulations targeting tax preparers.
1327	CRUZ	They did it under a more than 100yearold statute called the Dead Horse Act.
1328	CRUZ	Now, this statute and the IRS in classic Washington crony fashion had exemptions for lawyers and big fancy accountants, but Sabina had to pay $1,000 an employee.
1329	CRUZ	It would have driven her out of business, and Ms. Loving sued the IRS.
1330	CRUZ	She took the Obama IRS to court, and she won, and they struck down the rule for picking the big guys over the little guys.
1331	CAVUTO	Senator...
1332	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1333	CAVUTO	...Senator, I really want to be clear here.
1334	CAVUTO	Are you saying, sir, that if Bank of America were on the brink, you would let it fail?
1335	CRUZ	Yes.
1336	CRUZ	Now, let's be clear, there is a role for the Federal Reserve  what the Fed is doing now is it is a series of philosopher kings trying to guess what's happening with the economy.
1337	CRUZ	You look at the Fed, one of the reasons we had the financial crash is throughout the 2000s, we had loose money, we had an asset bubble, it drove up the price of real estate, drove up the price of commodities, and then in the third quarter of 2008, the Fed tightened the money and crashed those asset prices, which caused a cascading collapse.
1338	CRUZ	That's why I am supporting getting back to rulesbased monetary system not with a bunch of philosopherkings deciding, but tied...
1339	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1340	CAVUTO	Sir, I understand that.
1341	CAVUTO	I just want to be clear, if you don't mind, that millions of depositors would be on the line with that decision.
1342	CAVUTO	And I just want to be clear.
1343	CAVUTO	If it were to happen again, for whatever the reason, you would let it go, you would let a Bank of America go?
1344	CRUZ	So let me be clear.
1345	CRUZ	I would not bail them out, but instead of adjusting monetary policy according to whims and getting it wrong over and over again and causing booms and busts, what the Fed should be doing is, number one, keeping our money tied to a stable level of gold, and, number two, serving as a lender of last resort.
1346	CRUZ	That's what central banks do.
1347	CRUZ	So if you have a run on the bank, the Fed can serve as a lender of last resort, but it's not a bailout.
1348	CRUZ	It is a loan at higher interest rates.
1349	CRUZ	That's how central banks have worked.
1350	CRUZ	And I'll point out  look, we had a gold standard under Bretton Woods, we had it for about 170 years of our nation's history, and enjoyed booming economic growth and lower inflation than we have had with the Fed now.
1351	CRUZ	We need to get back to sound money, which helps, in particular, working men and women.
1352	CRUZ	What Washington does  the people who are doing well in the Obama economy are those with power and influence in the Obama government.

1357	KASICH	Neil, that's the difference of being an executive.
1358	KASICH	And let me just explain when a bank is ready to go under and depositors are getting ready to lose their life savings, you just don't say we believe in philosophical concerns.
1359	KASICH	You know what an executive has to decide?
1360	KASICH	When there's a water crisis, how do we get water to the city?
1361	KASICH	When there's a school shooting, how do you get there and help heal a community?
1362	KASICH	When there are financial crisis, or a crisis with ebola, you got to go there and try to fix it.
1363	KASICH	Philosophy doesn't work when you run something.
1364	KASICH	And I gotta tell you, onthejob training for president of the United States doesn't work.

1368	KASICH	We need an executive who's been tried, has been tested, and judge the decisions that that executive makes.
1369	KASICH	I don't like what the Fed is doing, but I'll tell you what worries me more than anything else turning the Fed over to the Congress of the United States...
1370	BARTIROMO	Thank you, governor.
1371	CRUZ	So, Governor Kasich...
1372	KASICH	...so they can print the money.
1373	KASICH	That would be a very bad approach.
1374	BARTIROMO	Senator Rubio.
1375	CRUZ	...why would you then bail out rich Wall Street banks, but not Main street, not Mom and Pop, not Sabina Loving?
1376	KASICH	I wouldn't.
1377	KASICH	I wouldn't.
1378	CRUZ	But you just said an executive...
1379	KASICH	No.
1380	KASICH	No, I didn't say that.
1381	CRUZ	...knows to step in and bail out a bank.
1382	KASICH	They were  they were talking about what you would do with depositors.
1383	KASICH	Would you let these banks shut down?
1384	KASICH	My argument is, going forward, the banks have to reserve the capital, so that the  so that the people who own the capital start pressuring the banks to not take these risky approaches, Ted.
1385	KASICH	But at the end of the day...
1386	CRUZ	So you said you'd abandon philosophy and abandon principle...
1387	KASICH	...
1388	KASICH	I'm gonna tell you this.
1389	KASICH	Let me tell you this.

1392	KASICH	...because if during  well, I'll tell you what (ph).
1393	CRUZ	What would you do if the bank was failing?
1394	CRUZ	I would not let the people who put their money in there all go down.
1395	CRUZ	So you  you would bail them out.
1396	KASICH	As an executive  no.

1409	FIORINA	Can I just  could I just say, as a chief executive who's had to make tough calls to save jobs and to grow jobs, I think what's interesting about DoddFrank is it's a great example of how socialism starts.
1410	FIORINA	Socialism starts when government creates a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
1411	FIORINA	Government created the problem.

1413	FIORINA	Government created the problem of a real estate boom.
1414	FIORINA	How did we create it?

1416	FIORINA	Let's create a bubble," and then government stepped in  by the way, under president George W. Bush, banks were told  encouraged  told, really  to buy other banks, to take money.
1417	FIORINA	And now what do we have with DoddFrank?
1418	FIORINA	The classic of crony capitalism.
1419	FIORINA	The big have gotten bigger, 1,590 community banks have gone out of business, and on top of all that, we've created something called the Consumer Financial Production Bureau, a vast bureaucracy with no congressional oversight that's digging through hundreds of millions of your credit records to detect fraud.

1429	BARTIROMO	She was the first lady of the United States, a U.S. senator from New York, and secretary of state under Barack Obama.
1430	BARTIROMO	She has arguably more experience, certainly more time in government than almost all of you on stage tonight.
1431	BARTIROMO	Why should the American people trust you to lead this country, even though she has been so much closer to the office?
1432	RUBIO	Well, that's a great question, and let me begin by answering it.
1433	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1434	RUBIO	This election is about the future, about what kind of country this nation is gonna be in the 21st century.
1435	RUBIO	This next (ph) election is actually a generational choice.
1436	RUBIO	A choice about what kind of nation we will be in the 21st century.
1437	RUBIO	For over 2.5 centuries, America's been a special country, the one place on earth where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything, a nation that's been a force for good on this planet.
1438	RUBIO	But now, a growing number of Americans feel out of place in their own country.
1439	RUBIO	We have a society that stigmatizes those that hold cultural values that are traditional.
1440	RUBIO	We have a society where people  millions of people  are living paycheck to paycheck.
1441	RUBIO	They're working as hard as they ever have, but they're living paycheck to paycheck because the economy has changed underneath their feet.
1442	RUBIO	We have young Americans who owe thousands of dollars in student loans for a degree that doesn't lead to a job.
1443	RUBIO	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than starting, and around the world, every day brings news of a new humiliation for America  many the direct response  direct consequence of decisions made when Hillary Clinton was the secretary of the  of state.
1444	RUBIO	And so here's the truth this election is about the future, and the Democratic Party, and the political left has no ideas about the future.
1445	RUBIO	All their ideas are the same, tired ideas of the past.
1446	RUBIO	More government, more spending.
1447	RUBIO	For every issue for America, their answer is a new tax on someone, and a new government program.

1513	PAUL	So, what we really need is somebody that understands that we do need energy of all forms, and that means we will have solar, and wind, and hydro, but we will still have coal, and we still will have natural gas.
1514	PAUL	And, we've got to have an all of the above policy.
1515	PAUL	But, it would be a mistake to shut down all of our industries in the coal fields, and shut down the coal power plants.
1516	PAUL	If we did so we're going to have a day where we wake up and some of our big cities are either very cold, or very hot.
1517	PAUL	So, I think it's a big danger, and we shouldn't do it.
1518	PAUL	And, what we should do is say we want all of the above...
1519	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1520	PAUL	...We want to free up the energy sector, and let people produce, let them drill, let them explore.
1521	BUSH	Maria?
1522	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1523	CRUZ	Maria, critically, when it comes to climate change...
1524	BUSH	...We've had a 10% reduction in carbon emissions, and it isn't because of Solyndra.
1525	BUSH	It isn't because of the central planners in Washington D.C.
1526	BUSH	It's because we've had a great American success story, the explosion of natural gas.
1527	BUSH	Taking two existing technologies, and applying it through innovation has created lower carbon emissions, lower energy costs  40% of all the economic activity in the age of Obama has come from the energy sector, and Hillary Clinton wants to suppress that.
1528	BUSH	We  I think we ought to be expanding this.
1529	BUSH	High growth is the path to lower carbon, and more jobs.
1530	BUSH	I know for a fact, as Governor of the State of Florida, we created the largest land purchasing programs, and environment cleanup programs because we had a growing economy.
1531	BUSH	Our revenues were growing at 4.4%.
1532	BUSH	It allowed for resources to be able to protect the natural system.
1533	BUSH	We got to get to a conservation...
1534	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1535	BUSH	...in environmental policy that goes beyond just carbon...
1536	CRUZ	...Our  our...
1537	CAVUTO	...Alright, gentlemen, I know you want to  and I want to, be we also promised to get people home tonight, and we are going to take a quick break here.
1538	CAVUTO	I think it is fair to say at this juncture that you can discuss these issues, and only business issues, but still keep it interesting.
1539	CAVUTO	Stick around for these candidates closing statements.
1540	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1541	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1542	BAKER	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate.
1543	BAKER	And now, candidates, it's time for your closing statements.
1544	BAKER	You get 30 seconds each, and, Senator Paul, we will begin with you.
1545	PAUL	We're the richest, freest, most humanitarian nation in the history of mankind.
1546	PAUL	But we also borrow a million dollars a minute.
1547	PAUL	And the question I have for all Americans is, think about it, can you be a fiscal conservative if you don't conserve all of the money?
1548	PAUL	If you're a profligate spender, you spend money in an unlimited fashion for the military, is that a conservative notion?
1549	PAUL	We have to be conservative with all spending, domestic spending and welfare spending.
1550	PAUL	I'm the only fiscal conservative on the stage.
1551	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1552	BAKER	Thank you, Senator.
1553	BAKER	Governor Kasich?
1554	KASICH	Well, ladies and gentlemen, if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders were to win this election, my 16yearolds, I  I worry about what their life is going to be like.
1555	KASICH	You know, the conservative movement is all about opportunity.
1556	KASICH	It is about lower taxes.
1557	KASICH	It's about balanced budgets.
1558	KASICH	It's about less regulation.
1559	KASICH	And it's about sending power, money and influence back to where we live so we can run America from the bottom up.
1560	KASICH	In addition to that, once we have the power and the money and the influence with programs we shift out, that each of us have a responsibility to reach out and to rebuild our families, make them stronger, and connect our neighborhoods.
1561	KASICH	All that together  wealth, connection, family  America's greatest days are ahead.
1562	KASICH	We must win this election.
1563	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1564	BARTIROMO	Carly Fiorina?
1565	FIORINA	Imagine a Clinton presidency.
1566	FIORINA	Our military will continue to deteriorate.
1567	FIORINA	Our veterans will not be cared for.
1568	FIORINA	And, no, Mrs. Clinton, that situation is not exaggerated.
1569	FIORINA	The rich will get richer.
1570	FIORINA	The poor will get poorer.
1571	FIORINA	The middle class will continue to get crushed.
1572	FIORINA	And as bad as that picture is, what's even worse is that a Clinton presidency will corrode the character of this nation.
1573	FIORINA	Why?
1574	FIORINA	Because of the Clinton way Say whatever you have to, lie as long as you can get away with it.
1575	FIORINA	We must beat Hillary Clinton.
1576	FIORINA	Carly Fiorina can beat Hillary Clinton.
1577	FIORINA	I will beat Hillary Clinton.
1578	FIORINA	And under a President Fiorina, we will restore the character of this nation, the security of this nation, the prosperity of this nation, because as citizens, we will take our government back.
1579	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1580	BARTIROMO	Former Governor Jeb Bush?
1581	BUSH	Jane Horton is sitting with my wife here today.
1582	BUSH	Her husband, Chris, was killed in action in Afghanistan.
1583	BUSH	And Jane spends her time now defending and fighting for military families.
1584	BUSH	They're both heroes.
1585	BUSH	I don't think we need an agitatorinchief or a dividerinchief.
1586	BUSH	We need a commanderinchief that will rebuild our military and restore respect to our veterans by revamping and fixing a broken Veterans Administration, That's my pledge to you.
1587	BUSH	I ask for your support.
1588	BUSH	Thank you.

1590	BARTIROMO	Senator Ted Cruz?
1591	CRUZ	Fiftyeight years ago, my father fled Cuba.
1592	CRUZ	As he stood on the deck of that ferryboat with the wind and salt air blowing, he looked back at the oppression and torture he was escaping.
1593	CRUZ	And yet he looked forward to the promise of America.
1594	CRUZ	His story is our story.
1595	CRUZ	What ties Americans together is we are all the children of those who risked everything for freedom.
1596	CRUZ	America is in crisis now.
1597	CRUZ	I believe in America.
1598	CRUZ	And if we get back to the free market principles and constitutional liberties that built this country, we can turn this country around.

1600	CRUZ	We're building a grassroots army.
1601	CRUZ	I ask you to join us at tedcruz.org.

1604	CAVUTO	Senator Marco Rubio?
1605	RUBIO	Ours  the story of America is an extraordinary story.
1606	RUBIO	It is the story of a nation that for over two centuries each generation has left the next better off than themselves.
1607	RUBIO	But now, because Washington is out of touch, for the fault of both political parties, for the first time in our history, that is in doubt.
1608	RUBIO	And that is what this election must be about, because if the next four years are anything like the last eight years, our children will be the first Americans ever left worse off by their parents.
1609	RUBIO	This election is about making a different choice, about applying our principles of limited government and free enterprise to the unique issues of our time.
1610	RUBIO	And if we do, we will not just save the American dream.
1611	RUBIO	We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before.
1612	RUBIO	And the 21st century can be a new American century.
1613	RUBIO	So tonight, I ask you for your vote and I ask you to join us at my website, marcorubio.com.
1614	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
1615	BARTIROMO	He's funny.
1616	CAVUTO	Dr. Ben Carson?
1617	CARSON	In the two hours of this  of this debate, five people have died from drugrelated deaths, $100 million has been added to our national debt, 200 babies have been killed by abortionists, and two veterans have taken their lives out of despair.
1618	CARSON	This is a narrative that we can change, not we the Democrats, not we the Republicans, but we the people of America, because there is something special about this nation, and we must embrace it and be proud of it and never give it away for the sake of political correctness.
1619	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
