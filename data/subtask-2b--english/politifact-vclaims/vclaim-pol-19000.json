But several Facebook posts have looked askance at such alliances in California.\u00a0\n\"Anyone in California find it funny that almost every school district is using Zoom to have class,\" one Facebook post says before misspelling the California governor\u2019s name. \"Guess who is the marketing CEO of Zoom? Pelosi\u2019s daughter/Newsome\u2019s cousin.\"\nThe post also shows the beginning of a link to a CNBC story about \"Zoom\u2019s marketing chief on the company\u2019s rise through the pandemic.\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Nancy Pelosi\u2019s brother-in-law, Ron Pelosi, was married to Gavin Newsom\u2019s aunt, making Ron Pelosi Newsom\u2019s uncle by marriage.\u00a0\nBut none of those family connections make either politician kin to Zoom\u2019s marketing officer.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19000"}
