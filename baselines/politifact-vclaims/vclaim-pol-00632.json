(KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\nWith that context, we decided to put a microscope to the president\u2019s claim.\nWe asked White House staff to point us to the policies or proposals on which Trump\u2019s statement was based. They declined to provide specifics but reiterated the president\u2019s assertion.\nTexas vs. Azar, and a health policy vacuum\nInterviews with four separate experts, though, suggested that the administration\u2019s stance on a pending lawsuit that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act runs counter to Trump\u2019s claim.\nThe case, known as Texas vs. Azar, comes from a group of Republican attorneys general who argue that the entire health law should be struck because the 2017 tax bill gutted Obamacare\u2019s requirement to have insurance, often called the individual mandate. In December, a Texas judge agreed.\nThe case is now before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. And, most relevant here, the Department of Justice \u2014 that is, the Trump administration\u2019s legal arm \u2014 has refused to defend the ACA in these proceedings.\nIt\u2019s highly unusual for an administration to decline to defend a federal law in court.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"This is a case when the department can make strong arguments in defense of the statute. Refusing to defend in those circumstances is almost unprecedented,\" said Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan.\nInitially, the Trump administration\u2019s position on the lawsuit focused on the individual mandate, arguing that without it the ACA\u2019s preexisting condition protections should be struck down, too. In filing a brief to the appellate court, though, the DOJ joined the plaintiffs to argue the law should be scrapped entirely. This outcome would also eliminate the law\u2019s protections for people with preexisting health conditions.\nIn that context, \"there is real cause for skepticism\" about Trump\u2019s assertion, said Wendy Netter Epstein, a law professor at DePaul University.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most generous assessment came from Jonathan Adler, a health law expert at Case Western Reserve University. Adler has supported previous Obamacare challenges, but he argued that this one is legally unsound.\nHe agreed that the White House\u2019s actual actions are \"at odds with the president\u2019s promise.\"\nBut, Adler said, the structure of Trump\u2019s claim \u2014 promising what his administration \"will\" do, rather than commenting on what it has done \u2014 leaves open the possibility of taking other steps to keep preexisting condition protections in place.\nThat\u2019s true, other experts acknowledged. So far, the White House has postponed a legislative push until after the 2020 election \u2014 leaving a vacuum if the courts do wipe out the health law.\nAnd, the GOP bills the White House has supported to date \u2014 including the so-called Graham-Cassidy legislation first proposed in 2017, which the administration again endorsed in its 2019 budget proposal \u2014 would fall short, multiple experts said.\nUnlike the ACA, Graham-Cassidy allows states to redefine which core benefits \u2014 a list that includes protections for people with health problems \u2014 insurance plans must cover, which would make those protections optional. (For more on Graham-Cassidy, here\u2019s another PolitiFact check from last fall.)\nPlus, experts said, even if the White House had a plan, the odds of it gaining passage are slim with a divided Congress.\nThat makes safeguarding the ACA in court \"the only show in town\" if the administration is serious about protecting consumers who have preexisting conditions, Bagley said.\nThere\u2019s one loophole that conservatives \u2014 the White House included \u2014 might lean on, suggested Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute. It relies on what people mean when they talk about \"protections.\"\nSome experts also point out that the administration has issued regulations that run contrary to Trump\u2019s claim. In particular, it recently issued a rule loosening restrictions on the length of so-called short-term health plans, which supporters said would bring a more affordable option to the individual insurance market. But these plans, which, because of the rule change, can last a year instead of three months, are considered bare-bones and are not required to provide preexisting condition protections.\nOur ruling\nTrump said his administration will \"always protect patients with preexisting conditions.\"\nThe White House\u2019s policy trajectory does exactly the opposite. The DOJ\u2019s stance, which reflects a policy in place at the same moment the president made this claim, would eliminate the only law guaranteeing that people with preexisting conditions both receive health coverage and do not have to pay more for it.\nAnd on the regulatory front, the administration has advanced a health insurance option that is not required to include these protections.\nFurthermore, the administration has not put forth any plan that might keep those guarantees in place. Every replacement health bill it has endorsed has offered protections less generous than those offered by the ACA. And it has taken further steps that could make it harder for people with preexisting conditions to get affordable coverage.\nThis statement is not accurate and makes a claim in direct opposition of what\u2019s actually happening.
