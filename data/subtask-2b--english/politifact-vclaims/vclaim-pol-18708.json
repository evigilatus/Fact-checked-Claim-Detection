Hoadley currently represents Michigan\u2019s 60th District in the state\u2019s House of Representatives and he\u2019s trying to unseat incumbent Republican Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, who was first elected to Congress in 1986.\nCLF\u2019s ad inaccurately characterizes blog posts Hoadley wrote in 2004 and 2005, over 15 years ago, when he was a college student at Michigan State University. CLF claims that what Hoadley wrote was \"sexist\" and \"creepy.\" The ad distorts other posts Hoadley wrote, claiming that Hoadley \"wanted to learn about crystal meth\" and \"wrote that his sexual partners were his victims.\"\nHoadley\u2019s blog, which has since been deleted, contained some insensitive comments but doesn\u2019t substantiate CLF\u2019s characterizations. In a statement to the New York Post which published a piece on the blog, Hoadley\u2019s campaign said the posts were \"bad college poetry.\" In a Facebook video released Aug. 10, Hoadley issued an apology: \"I said things 16 years ago that I would never say today that aren\u2019t reflective of who I am, and so for folks that I hurt with my words, I\u2019m sorry.\"\nHoadley is 37 years-old and the first openly LGBTQ person to run for Congress in Michigan. The LGBTQ Victory Fund, a national organization dedicated to electing LGBTQ candidates, accused CLF of using harmful tropes about gay men. CLF press secretary Will Reinert defended the ad in an email, reiterating its claim that the blog shows lack of judgment.\nA closer look at each of the ad\u2019s claims in context showed that CLF\u2019s ad is inaccurate and misleading.\n\"Hoadley called women \u2018breeders.\u2019 That\u2019s sexist.\"\nIn a blog entry dated Jun. 20, 2005, when Hoadley was 21 years-old and had just completed his junior year in college, Hoadley recapped a weekend in D.C., including going out to straight bars with two friends. \"Glad I went\u2026but my straight fix has been satisfied for a while. I\u2019m not going to lie: breeder=weird/bad dancers. Disagree if you want\u2014you\u2019re just deluding yourself,\" Hoadley wrote. According to Urban Dictionary, a \"breeder\" is a derogatory term to describe straight people. The term can refer to either straight men or straight women. The term is contemptuous, but it\u2019s not sexist and Hoadley wasn\u2019t using it to describe straight women exclusively.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on February 5, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Clara Hendrickson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He wanted to learn about crystal meth\"\nThis needs context. In a blog entry dated May 23, 2005 Hoadley wrote, \"Tonight I went to an event at a leather bar. By myself. To learn about crystal meth. Don't do meth.\" Hoadley told an LGBTQ news website that the event was an information meeting about meth\u2019s impact on the LGBTQ community.\nHe \"wrote that his sexual partners were his victims\"\nThis is misleading. Before sharing a poem titled \"Burned By Love\" on Jun. 14, 2005, Hoadley told his readers the post was fictional: \"Wrote this awhile ago...looking for some feedback. BTW, sometimes fiction is the best way to tell truth \u2014 so don\u2019t go getting any ideas about me.\" The poem, which appears to be about the search for connection, contains the lines, \"I turn to my little black book that\u2019s commonly called a cell phone. My fingers walk as I talk to the latest victim of my sexual conquest.\" CLF\u2019s claim does not disclose Hoadley\u2019s note that this was not about him.\n\"Hoadley even wrote about a four-year-old wearing a thong\"\nThis is inaccurate. In a Aug. 12, 2004 blog post, Hoadley shared what appeared to be a jovial conversation he had with a friend who said that he had a secret desire to be a flower girl. Toward the end of the conversation, Hoadley wrote \"just don't let them make you look too fresh...you know how hoochie they try to make the flower girl,\" using a derogatory word to describe a sexually promiscuous woman. Hoadley\u2019s friend responded, \"I KNOW! I mean I shudder everytime I see a four year old wearing a thong.\" Hoadley did not write about a four-year-old wearing a thong as CLF claims. Nevertheless, CLF called the comment \"creepy\" in its ad but both Hoadley and his friend noted their revulsion to sexualizing children.\nOur ruling\nDrawing from posts Hoadley wrote on his college blog, CLF\u2019s ad claims, \"Hoadley called women \u2018breeders.\u2019... wanted to learn about crystal meth and wrote that his sexual partners were his victims. Hoadley even wrote about a four year-old wearing a thong.\"\nHoadley used the term \"breeders\" to refer to straight people, not women specifically. Hoadley attended an event to learn about the impact of crystal meth on the LGBTQ community. CLF\u2019s claim implies that Hoadley was interested in experimenting with the illegal substance. Hoadley wrote a poem that contained the line, \"I talk to the latest victim of my sexual conquest,\" but his blog post noted his writing was a piece of fiction and that he was not talking about himself. Hoadley relayed a conversation in which his friend said he \"shudders\" at the thought of a four year-old being dressed in a thong. Both Hoadley and his friend were expressing their disdain for sexualizing children.\nCLF\u2019s ad contains a small element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this ad Mostly False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18708"}
