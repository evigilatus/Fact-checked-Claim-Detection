Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsed the Ohio governor for president during a rally in Columbus this week.\nBut did Schwarzenegger, a fellow Republican, bend the truth when he described Ohio\u2019s financial turnaround under Kasich?\nIn his endorsement speech, Schwarzenegger called Kasich an \"action hero,\" saying that when Kasich became governor in 2011, \"there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there\u2019s a $2 billion surplus.\"\n\nWe decided to check that claim. Kasich has made similar statements throughout his campaign for president, and highlighted this fiscal transformation on his website.\n\"I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole \u2026 to a $2 billion surplus,\" Kasich said during the Republican presidential debate in Cleveland last year.\nThe national PolitiFact team took a deeper look at Kasich\u2019s claim last August.\nIt\u2019s very similar to Schwarzenegger\u2019s claim. Here\u2019s what it found:\nAn $8 billion hole?\nThere\u2019s an argument for $8 billion, but there\u2019s also an argument for something closer to $6 billion, according to a deep dive by the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2011.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $8 billion figure is rounded up from a $7.7 billion gap between spending and expected revenues. It was an initial estimate from January 2011, based on the assumption made several months earlier that there would be no new revenue growth. However, revenues did grow as the economy rebounded that year, reducing the gap to between $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion -- a calculation that Kasich\u2019s budget director, Tim Keen, agreed with \"conceptually\" in a 2011 interview, though he took issue with some of the methodological details.\nWhatever the number, Kasich avoided a potential misstep when he spoke of this as a \"hole\" rather than a deficit. Ohio, like most states, cannot run an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion gap is more accurately described as a projected shortfall rather than a deficit. Schwarzenegger used the term \"deficit,\" which we interpreted as a minor misstatement rather than an attempt to deceive.\nA $2 billion surplus?\nThis figure is clearer. Ohio\u2019s Office of Budget and Management reported in July 2015 that the state\u2019s \"rainy day fund\" had a little more than $2 billion in it, up from effectively zero when Kasich took office in 2011. The surplus remained above $2 billion this week, said a spokesman for the budget office.\nDoes Kasich deserve credit?\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to give Kasich some credit for the state\u2019s improving economic fortunes -- he is a governor, after all, and he forged the state\u2019s fiscal policy in concert with the Legislature. Schwarzenegger\u2019s claim strongly implies Kasich played a central role in the turnaround, though it doesn\u2019t explicitly link the two together.\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that Kasich took office at the very beginning of the national economic recovery, and as the national economy has improved, so has Ohio\u2019s. When Kasich was inaugurated in January 2011, the unemployment rate in Ohio was 9.2 percent -- exactly the same as the national rate. As of December, the national unemployment rate was 5 percent and the rate in Ohio was 4.8 percent. So Kasich\u2019s timing has been fortunate.\nOur ruling\nIn his endorsement speech, Schwarzenegger said that when Kasich became governor, \"there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there\u2019s a $2 billion surplus.\"\nKasich said, \"I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole \u2026 to a $2 billion surplus.\"\nIt\u2019s possible to argue over whether the starting point should be $6 billion rather than $8 billion. But Kasich and Schwarzenegger didn\u2019t pull that figure out of thin air, though it certainly was high by historical standards. Kasich also used the term \"hole,\" which is more appropriate than \"deficit.\" Meanwhile, the $2 billion figure seems solid. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that Kasich spoke a little grandly when he said that \"I\" did it, since the state\u2019s fiscal improvement got a big assist from the national economic recovery.\nThe statements are accurate but need additional information, so we rate them Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05304"}
