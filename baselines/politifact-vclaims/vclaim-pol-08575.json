It resurfaced Oct. 21, 2013, \u00a0when WPRO talk show host John DePetro was interviewing Brett Smiley, who plans to run for mayor of Providence.\nDePetro asked Smiley what he\u2019d do as mayor about the number of \"illegal aliens\" in the city, and then said that \"under Mayor [David] Cicilline, it [Providence] was a sanctuary city. He and the chief at the time, Dean Esserman, they wouldn\u2019t cooperate with ICE regarding illegals in the city.\"\nThe sanctuary city charge has been aimed at Cicilline, now a U.S. representative, before. Brendan Doherty, Cicilline\u2019s Republican opponent in the 2012 congressional election, claimed during that campaign that Cicilline \"espoused\" Providence as a sanctuary city. \u00a0We found no evidence that Cicilline ever took that position and ruled Doherty\u2019s claim False. We wondered whether DePetro\u2019s phrasing was more on the mark.\nDePetro said he based his statement on what he views as Providence\u2019s begrudging-at-best cooperation with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. \u00a0\nHe said a prime example of that was the handling of a 2008 rape by Marco Riz, a Guatemalan man who was in the country illegally. Riz, who kidnapped a woman in Warwick and assaulted her in Providence\u2019s Roger Williams Park, is serving a 30-year sentence.\nThe Providence police had picked Riz up on a misdemeanor charge months before the rape and released him, even though he had previously been ordered deported by an immigration judge.\nIn news accounts at the time, the Providence police and ICE each found reason to blame the other for the mistake. Providence police said they\u2019d checked a national warrant database and found no warrants for Riz. They said they\u2019d faxed a copy of his arraignment form to ICE and the agency never responded.\nICE officials said Providence police should have contacted the agency\u2019s Vermont office to check Riz\u2019s status, and if they had, they\u2019d have found about about the deportation order.\n(Now, instead of faxing reports, Providence police electronically transmit arrested suspects\u2019 fingerprints to the attorney general\u2019s office, which automatically adds them to national databases that ICE monitors, said Providence police spokeswoman Lindsay Lague and \u00a0attorney general spokeswoman Amy Kempe .)\nSo what about DePetro\u2019s claim?\nThe phrase \"sanctuary city\" gets tossed around a lot when immigration policy is being discussed, but even experts have a hard time defining it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a congressional hearing in 2007, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff observed, \"you know, people use the term sanctuary city in different ways, so I\u2019m never quite sure what people mean.\"\nSome have applied the term to cities such as New Haven, Conn., where the city issues its own identity cards regardless of immigration status, cards that can be used to get city services or open bank accounts.\nOr Takoma Park, Md., where residents who are not citizens of the United States have been allowed to vote in local elections since 1993.\nOr San Francisco, where the city and county have ordinances that specifically forbid city employees from helping ICE unless ordered to by federal or state law or a warrant.\nOr Cook County, Ill., where the county commissioners voted not to honor ICE requests to hold prisoners unless ICE was willing to pay for their incarceration. It also ordered that, absent a criminal warrant, county law enforcement personnel were not to expend time responding to ICE inquiries.\nProvidence had none of those measures under Mayor Cicilline, nor does it now.\nIn 2007, then-City Councilman Miguel Luna proposed an ordinance that would have specifically declared Providence a \"sanctuary city.\" It never made it out of the Ordinance Committee for a vote.\nWhile Cicilline was mayor, however, the city resisted then-Gov. Donald Carcieri\u2019s efforts to enlist municipalities in immigration enforcement. But Providence continued to notify federal ICE officials when it arrested suspected illegal immigrants and was never cited for failure to cooperate by the federal government.\nOur ruling\nJohn DePetro said that under Mayor David Cicilline, Providence \"was a sanctuary city.\"\nWhile there is no legal definition of \"sanctuary city,\" in the eight years that Cicilline was mayor Providence had not taken any of the measures adopted by other cities often identified by that label.\nWe rule DePetro\u2019s statement False.\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.
