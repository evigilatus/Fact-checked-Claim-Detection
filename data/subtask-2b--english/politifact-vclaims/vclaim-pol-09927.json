Charlie Crist has the Florida political world buzzing about a potential face-off with Republican Gov. Rick Scott in 2014.\n\nScott\u2019s response to the hypothetical showdown\u00a0with the Republican-turned-independent-turned Democrat has been simple: Avoid direct comment but point out how Florida hemorrhaged jobs under Crist\u2019s watch.\n\n\"The four years before I became governor, the state had lost 825,000 jobs. Unemployment had gone from 3.5 percent to 11.1 percent. We incurred another $5.2 billion, I think, worth of debt,\" Scott said at a Dec. 11, 2012, news conference.\n\nWe thought his talking points about Florida\u2019s economy under Crist merited a fact-check. It probably won\u2019t be the last time Scott takes a dig at his predecessor.\n\nIn this item, we'll examine Scott\u2019s claims about the unemployed under Crist. We will examine the debt claim in a separate item.\n\nPolitiFact has addressed similar jobs claims about governors in many states. We often find the numbers are right but the blame is exaggerated. The impact of a governor on a state\u2019s economic health is usually pretty small, experts say.\n\nJobless ranks swelled\n\nScott\u2019s math on the number of jobs Florida lost during Crist\u2019s tenure is correct if you compare the month before his inauguration (December 2006) with his last month in office (December 2010).\n\nFlorida\u2019s workforce contracted from 8,043,000 non-farm workers to 7,217,500 -- a loss of 825,500 jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.\n\nThe state lost half of its construction jobs during that period, shrinking from 668,600 to 336,400.\n\nScott has touted the state\u2019s declining unemployment rate under his tenure as a sign of economic improvement. (But a rapidly declining rate is not always worth bragging about, as we noted in this fact-check, because it has been the sign of a shrinking workforce as a result of discouraged workers giving up on finding jobs in the state.)\n\nThere\u2019s no denying Florida\u2019s employment situation went from robust to bleak under Crist. In December 2006, the state\u2019s unemployment rate was 3.5 percent. (Remember those days?!) In December 2010, the rate was 11.1 percent.\n\nThe state's unemployment rate has inched down in the months since Scott took office. The most recent rate was 8.5 percent in October 2012.\n\nWhose fault is it?\n\nMark Vitner, Wells Fargo senior economist, said assessing who is responsible when thing go bad -- or when they improve -- is a difficult task. The more pertinent question, he said, is \"What policy action did you try to take to try to mitigate the economic recession or engender an economic recovery?\"\n\n\"Whether it was luck or whatever, during his tenure Florida\u2019s economy sank into the worst recession since the Great Depression,\" he said.\n\nWe asked Scott's press office for examples of how Crist played a role in Florida's economic downturn. Scott spokesman John Tupps wrote in an email, \"Florida's economic improvement and job creation under Gov. Scott is undeniable.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics who studies Florida, said Crist is not responsible for the state\u2019s economic decline because \"the seeds of destruction\" had already been sown by the time he took office.\n\nHome sales and prices had already peaked in 2005 and 2006. Behind the scenes lurked a number of major issues: mortgage lending to borrowers who couldn\u2019t afford to repay their loans and Wall Street bankers buying those loans and selling them to investors.\n\n\"I don\u2019t remember hearing about states in 2004 taking a stand against home building,\" said Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida. \"It was bringing in revenue. There was a lot of benefits that the boom side of the housing market created. There were significant costs when we went into bust.\"\n\nAdded Lafakis: \"That had very very little to do with Charlie Crist.\"\n\nThe onset of the housing crisis, coupled with the state\u2019s dependence on a constant flow of new residents, meant Florida suffered more than other states, he said.\n\nThe wealth of out-of-state retirees \"was eviscerated\" during the recession, he said, making them less able to retire in Florida. And working-age people faced either reduced job opportunities in major metro areas like Tampa and Orlando or could not sell their homes and relocate here, Lafakis said.\n\n\"Would it have been different with someone else in office?\" Lafakis said. \"The wheels were already in motion. He (Crist) suffered from the worst timing that you could pick.\"\n\nAnd unlike the federal government, the state government cannot run deficits in an effort to stimulate the economy because of balanced budget requirements. States basically \"have to ride it out,\" Snaith said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nScott is right about the grim jobless figures: The state\u2019s employment picture worsened almost as soon as Crist became governor and did not let up.\n\nBut Scott misses the mark for implying the state\u2019s recession was the result of a poor handling by Crist. Florida\u2019s economy tanked largely as a result of the housing market crisis, a tornado of issues over which Crist had little to no control.\n\nWe rate Scott\u2019s statement Half True.\n\nUpdate: This fact-check was updated shortly after publication to include comment from the governor's office.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09927"}
