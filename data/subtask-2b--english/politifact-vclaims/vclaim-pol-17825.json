In 2014, the Crimea region of Ukraine was annexed by Russia, an act the United States considers illegal.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Another 12 vaccines have begun phase 2 trials. And more than 100 other vaccines that haven\u2019t begun clinical trials are in the pipeline.\n\n\nNo COVID-19 vaccine trials in Ukraine are listed in the federal ClinicalTrials.gov database, which tracks privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world; and none are listed in the ISRCTN registry, another global research registry.\nThe article\nThe article claims that, using a vaccine that had not been tested on people in the United States, American virologists tested residents in the area of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesman for what was identified as the People\u2019s Militia of the LPR was quoted as saying that of 15 people tested, five died \"from complications caused by the infection.\"\u00a0\nOf the 15 allegedly tested, 10 were said to be from the Ukrainian military, as were four of the dead.\nLPR, which stands for Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, has asserted governmental authority over a region in eastern Ukraine without the authorization of the government of Ukraine since 2014, according to GlobalSecurity.org, which does research on homeland security and related topics.\u00a0\nThe ruble has mostly replaced the Ukrainian currency there and \"a strong pro-Russian and anti-Western ideology prevails,\" according to Carnegie Europe, part of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington, D.C. think tank.\nNo confirmation\nOur searches of Google and Nexis turned up no mainstream news reports or other authoritative accounts of what was in the article.\u00a0\n\"This is an obvious fake,\" Peter Zalmayev, director of the Eurasia Democracy Initiative, told PolitiFact.\nBased in New York with staff in Ukraine, the group says it \"works to educate the public in the United States about the post-Communist world from the Balkans to Central Asia.\"\nStopFake, a prominent fact-checking organization in Ukraine, reported that other websites in the LPR region and Russian news sites had carried similar articles about the alleged testing and deaths. It labeled the stories fake.\n\"The entire story is completely made up,\" StopFake reported, based on an interview with a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces Medical Service Corps. The spokesperson noted that in recent months, no foreign medical specialists had visited Ukraine\u2019s military.\nNews Front\u2019s reputation\nAs for News Front, StopFake reported in May that it is \"a pro-Kremlin outlet with a record of publishing conspiratorial stories, including other fake news about the coronavirus.\"\u00a0\n(The New York Times reported that StopFake, hired earlier this year by Facebook to help curb the flow of Russian propaganda and other false news across its platform in Ukraine, is battling accusations of ties to the Ukrainian far right and of bias in its fact-checking, and that the International Fact-Checking Network is conducting an \"interim assessment\" of StopFake. The IFCN is based at the Poynter Institute, which owns PolitiFact.)\nOther organizations have issued similar warnings about News Front.\nIn August 2019, EUvsDisinfo, which says it responds to Russian disinformation against the EU, wrote that News Front operates from Crimea and \"has always been a reliable source of disinformation. The site... is ambitiously publishing lies in eight languages.\"\nCoda Story, a nonprofit journalism site that focuses on in-depth reporting and fighting disinformation in Eurasia, reported from Crimea in 2018 on the leader of News Front. The pro-Moscow News Front has \"carved out a reputation for its staunchly pro-Kremlin line and a steady output of stories which media monitors such as Stop Fake say are false or deliberately inflammatory,\" according to Coda Story.\nNews Front did not reply to our requests for information.\nWith no evidence to back a claim that was made by a source known for disinformation, we rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17825"}
