But the marginal voices on the Internet indicate that Ebola is even more threatening than the U.S. government. This week, the Invowars conspiracy site reported that the U.S. State Department ordered 160,000 Ebola protective suits, raising fears that the federal government is anticipating the rapid spread of the virus. The InfoWars report states a press release from Lakeland Industries, which manufactures protective clothing, and InfoWars states that \"only 1,400 federal workers are currently in the region (West Africa), indicating that the figure of 160,000 is much higher than only required to send medical personnel abroad. From there, InfoWars refers to a German viral scientist that the number of Ebola deaths will rise to 5 million (the Ebola outbreak caused 2,630 deaths at the time of writing) and notes that \"Ebola could have been transported by air to at least a limited extent.\" (We found many other examples of the Hazmat story floating around the Internet.) We will not see speculation on the evolution of Ebola, but we wanted to verify his claim that the State Department ordered 160,000 Ebola-preventive suits, and that their situation reflects the Federal Government's expectation of the \"rapid deployment\" of Ebola. The press release issued by The Lakeland, announcing \"increased manufacturing capacity\" for \"specialized protective allowances for health-care workers and others exposed to Ebola,\" contains only a provision concerning the order of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They say, \"We encourage all protective clothing companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed decorations so that our industry can play its part in addressing this threat to global health.\" This is not a big deal, but there is a decisive distinction obscured by InfoWars: the press release mentions an offer, not \"an order.\" This means that while the purchase of 160,000 suits may be in the works, it is not yet final and may not even happen. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) spokesman, Matt Herrick, said that he could not \"talk to specific purchases being carried out and not awarded,\" but stressed that the Leland press release referred to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and our ongoing efforts to secure personal protection equipment to combat the spread of Ebola.\" The bidding InfoWars refers to coming from the United States Agency for International Development, which is technically independent of the Department of State. However, the two organizations are working closely together. On January 11, 2021, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) reported on a television section that says that Joe Biden is on the video \"advertising\" election fraud in \"recognition.\" \u2022 On 12 January 2021, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided preventive equipment to partners in Africa since March, according to Herick. This includes hazardous material suits such as Kimmax 1 referred to in the Leekland press release. This case, although not limited to Ebola, is designed to protect against infectious agents. In addition to these cases, USAID assistance to African organizations has been in the form of disease control experts, funding and a variety of emergency supplies. We have referred Herrick to this series of press releases on the efforts of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \"Last month, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) transferred more than 16 tons of medical supplies and emergency equipment to Liberia,\" said Herrick, including 10,000 protective suits, water treatment units and plastic sheeting for Ebola treatment units. This may sound like a lot of suits, but \"the set of equipment is designed to wear only once and then dispose of it once the treatment is done,\" said Herrick. \"Many groups are required for each health provider.\" \"The United States Agency for International Development has purchased and delivered over 100,000 suits so far, and we're on our way to buy and deliver over 130,000 extra suits,\" said Herrick. Equipment is provided to local health-care workers and non-governmental partners working in affected countries. Herick would not have explained in detail how the allowances derived from the tender were linked to the plans of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), but the figures he provided were a crucial context. The 160,000 suits are not actually \"a lot higher than what is required to send medical personnel abroad,\" as InfoWars claimed. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has already filed many cases, and there seems to be an immediate need for more. This information is also public through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) press releases, so it is not as if it specifically predicts a \"fast spread\" of Ebola outside the current outbreak. InfoWars claimed that the Department of State \"ordered 160,000 Ebola protective suits,\" indicating that \"the federal government expects the rapid spread of the virus that has claimed the lives of an unprecedented number.\" The relevant federal government agency is the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), but this is technically something. An official of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) told us that suits are only one use, so 160,000 suits are not actually an astronomical quantity. In fact, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has already provided 100,000 suits to Ebola-infected Africa. Their new offer, despite the expansion of their efforts, is consistent with what the United States Agency for International Development has done so far, and it does not prove that the Federal Government expects any kind of \"rapid deployment.\" We value the claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07278"}
