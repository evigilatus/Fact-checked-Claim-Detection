Rick Scott, R. No, outlined his opposition to the new Green Compact concluded by the Democrats in an article on 25 February: \"If you are unaware of it, here's a copy of the cliff notes: it calls for the reconstruction or alteration of every building in America in the next 10 years, the elimination of all fossil fuels in 10 years, the elimination of nuclear energy, and the elimination of air travel (which will be replaced by high-speed railways).\" Scott described chaos if a democracy won the presidency; about 2020, presidential candidates co-sponsored the new Green Compact. \"What then? # Destroy all the buildings, remove oil and gas, and stop air travel # Let's press the brakes there -- do the Democrats want to end the air travel? We found that Scott ignored the actual text of the resolution. The resolution does not land on aircraft, either now or in the future. Climateists told us that the elimination of air travel is not a practical goal. The decision does not mention the decision of the \"New Green Deal\" presented by Okasio Cortez on February 7, with 89 democratic sponsors. One of the accompanying measures in the Senate, introduced by Sin. Ed Marky, D-Mass., has approximately a dozen sponsors -- all Democrats -- including candidates for the presidency of Curry Booker, Kristin Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobochar, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren. In general, these resolutions address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment. Even if the two Councils passed, the resolution would not be binding. So what does the House of Representatives resolution say about air travel? In one word, nothing. He doesn't mention planes at all. It calls for \"the excessive transportation system in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector to the extent technologically feasible,\" which includes \"investment in high-speed railways.\" What FAB said was that we contacted Scott &apos; s press office and did not hear it on the deadline, but the Senator was probably referring to some supporting documents issued by the staff of Okasio Cortez. There is a document that often raises questions, or FAQ, that mentioned the aircraft twice, where I said (confirmed) \"We are not sure that we will be able to completely get rid of the fare from the cows and planes so quickly, but we believe that we can increase the renewable industrialization and energy production, repair every building in America, build the smart network, repair transportation and agriculture, plant a lot of trees, and restore our ecosystem to zero net.\" The United States Armed Forces also called on the United States \"to fully repair transport through the massive expansion of electric vehicle manufacture, the construction of shipping stations everywhere, the construction of high-speed railways on a scale where air travel stops become necessary, and the creation of affordable public transport, with a view to replacing each combustion engine.\" For the record, according to Santa Barbara Senselin, \"Apes contribute to global warming, although they often do so by burping instead of farting.\" In an interview with him on 31 January 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"dropped more water in Houston in five days than Niagara Falls in one year.\" By Brandon Mulder on 5 February 2021, once the FAQ document became public, the idea that Democrats wanted to make air travel obsolete was picked up by Fox News and some Republican politicians, including President Donald Trump. The press office in Ocacio-Cortez did not respond to this verification of the facts, but its Chief of Staff had previously said that there were many common documents among the various interest groups, and that the issuance of this particular document was a mistake. Climate change experts say that ending air travel is not a goal that climate change experts say it is important to focus on the language used in the actual solution and not in the questionnaire, which does not carry weight. \"It seems to me that those lines of FAQ were light-hearted and unconsidered, and it is not clear why they were published,\" said Sean Hecht, Co-Executive Director, Emmett Institute for Climate Change and Environment at the University of California. Hecht noted that the Armed Forces of C\u00f4te d &apos; Ivoire (FACI) did not contain any regulatory strategy to prohibit or even limit air travel. He said: \"Even in the FAA, it creates conditions that make \"air travel stops becoming necessary\" because alternatives are available -- do not limit or terminate air travel.\" David Fayskov, Director of Climate Policy of SexGen American Climate, said that the new green agreement called for the goal of \"zero net,\" which recognized that emissions - including those from air travel - would not be eliminated in 10 years, so that negative emissions needed to be found to balance them. (The next generation of climate in America started by a billionaire Tom Styre. In 2018, the People &apos; s Democratic Congress supported Scott &apos; s democratic opponent, Bill Nelson.) \"Commentation on cows and aircraft is by no means an expression of the objective of judicial policy in practice, either. It's a presentation of information that some supporters may not want to hear -- that we're not gonna get rid of the entire emissions, so we need some additional negative emissions -- expressed in what I consider to be a public tone that, unfortunately, you left open to deception by critics. \"There is no serious observer or supporter of the new green deal, a climate scientist, or other climate lawyer who will consider these statements as an expression of a policy aimed at eliminating cows or aircraft.\" Air travel retains a unique role in moving people for long distances. \"When people classify the difficulty of finding structural solutions to greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, air travel is one of the most difficult both technological and practical proposals, and there are no serious political proposals so far that would resolve the issue by limiting air travel or changing the energy sources of commercial aircraft on a large scale.\" \"So it's not a policy priority\" The serious steps that the United States could take to reduce emissions from air travel emissions would include more efficient aircraft, more direct routes and alternative low-carbon biofuels. Paul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Institute for Progressive Policy and lecturer in environmental policy at the American University, said that electric aircraft might be possible in the long term. \"No serious climate experts call for an end to air travel -- this is simply a red herring,\" said Bledzo, who was the climate change adviser to the White House Clinton. Our time to rule, to bring this verification of the truth to the landing. Scott wrote in a newspaper article that the new Green Democratic Agreement includes \"work towards ending air travel.\" The resolution does not refer to the termination of air travel. Instead, it calls for \"excess transport systems,\" which include \"investment in high-speed railways.\" Scott took over a letter document from the Democrats that mentioned, perhaps in joking, the disposal of \"cows and planes.\" However, we have found no evidence that the disposal of aircraft is a serious political idea from climate advocates. We're assessing this statement wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9bff8cf-473e4439-bf37-6ee568e32fda", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00960"}
