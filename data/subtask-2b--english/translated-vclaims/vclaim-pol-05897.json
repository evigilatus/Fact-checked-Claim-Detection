On October 4, 2015, George Stefanopoulos asked Trump why a crowd from New Hampshire told him that he would send refugees to Syria if he won the presidency. Trump had previously said that he would accept some Syrian refugees on humanitarian grounds. \"Migration was strange to me because it looked like a lot of men,\" answered Trump. \"There are not many women, there are not many children. He looked like men mostly and looked like strong men. They look like physically strong people. And I say, \"Where are all the women? Where are all the children?\" Stefanoplos Trump said that half of the refugees were children, causing the billionaire to change gears and wondered why the United States was planning to receive so many refugees. Trump described Syrian refugees as not many children and women who were not right for us, so we decided to check it out. It seems Trump was confusing his point about a few different issues. The registered refugees against seamen in the interview, Trump started talking about how he heard that America was accepting 3,000 refugees, then 10,000, and \"Now I hear we want to receive 200,000 refugees.\" Trump said: \"We don't know where they come from, we don't know who they are. They could be ISIS. It could be a great Trojan horse. I mean, this could be one of the greatest Trojan horse ever since the original.\" His campaign did not come back to us to clarify his remarks, but for us and the experts with whom we consulted, his response seemed to take into account a completely different group of refugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees registers and tracks Syrian refugees in camps in several States, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and North African countries. According to the figures we obtained in October 4, the total is over 4 million. Of these 4 million, 50.3 per cent are female and 51.1 per cent are children (boys and girls) aged 17 years or under. In total, only 23.5 per cent of United Nations refugees throughout the Middle East and North Africa are men over the age of 18. So that settles this argument, right? Not quite. According to Jeffrey Mok, a Syrian expert at Amnesty International in the United States of America, Trump's account may have referred to the mass influx of refugees and immigrants in Europe, rather than to refugees registered with the United Nations in the camps that Stefanopoulos was asking about. \"This is a complex matter, Trump is right in my mind at a few points, but he corrupts positions, terribly confusing them until a point that is so far from the base,\" said Mok. Trump most likely means so-called \"seamen,\" refugees and immigrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea into continental Europe. The United Nations accounts for some 534,000 people who crossed into Europe this year, with nearly 3,000 deaths during the journey. As far as Trump is concerned, 69 percent of the arrivals by sea are men, and these are the ones who dominate the headlines of the humanitarian crisis in Europe. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, about 55 percent of them are from Syria. The rest are from all over Asia and Africa, and from places such as Eritrea, Afghanistan and the Sudan. These persons are not Syrians in registered refugee camps. However, as Trump warned, some claim to be Syrians and not, many of whom are already undocumented, told Polyte Fruitah. But the problem with Trump's statement is that none of the majority of male refugees and immigrants in Europe are coming to the United States. The resettlement of refugees cannot be confirmed from where Trump obtained the 200,000, but it may point to Secretary of State John Kerry's announcement in September that the United States would accept 85,000 refugees worldwide in 2016, an increase of over 70,000. In 2017, this number will rise to 100,000, bringing the total number of refugees to 185,000 over two years. To add further wrinkles to Trump's already confusing allegations, not all of these will be Syrian refugees, but refugees from all over the world. Kerry said that some expansion was to accommodate Syrians, but there was no indication of a number. The United Nations said that 10 per cent, or about 400,000, of Syrian refugees in the camps needed to be resettled. President Barack Obama announced that in the 2016 fiscal year (until 30 September), the United States would accept at least 10,000 refugees from Syria. These 10,000 are not necessarily the kind of agents that ISIL might be, as Trump fears, according to Mok. \"Priorities go to torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, children and adolescents on their own, women and children at risk,\" said Mok. The persons selected are subject to scrutiny by government agencies, including the Ministry of Internal Security. The process could take years. This does not mean an effective way to intimidate the United States, as the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies said, its oldest colleague, David Gartenstein-Ross. While it was a legitimate concern that there were ways to overcome the screening process, he said that there were more effective ways for ISIL cells to reach America than Tramp feared. \"It would be much easier for a terrorist group to send a person across Europe or put him on a plane to the United States,\" said Gartenstein Ross. \"If they can pass the refugee screening process, they can certainly get on a plane.\" Moreover, the Tramp scenario for scrutiny does not stand when it takes into account that it is faking the parties involved. \"When Trump raises concerns about the images of young people among the refugees who have arrived in Europe, and this has absolutely nothing to do with Obama's resettlement programme, which will benefit the population identified by the United Nations as the most vulnerable among the 4 million Syrians in the refugee camps, all of whom have been identified and registered,\" said Muk. Our rule, Trump, said, \"There are not many women, there are not many children\" among Syrian refugees. Trump seems to confuse two different groups of refugees: those 534,000 who arrive in Europe by sea, mostly men, and 4 million Syrians in United Nations refugee camps, mostly women and children. Only about 10,000 refugees are scheduled to be resettled in camps in the United States next year. Those who take a dangerous journey to Europe are not. Refugees in this category are, as a matter of priority, survivors of torture, persons suffering from serious medical conditions, unaccompanied children and adolescents, and women and children at risk. These factors, coupled with background disclosure, suggest that they are unlikely to be ISIS agents waiting for United States terrorism. Trump's assessment of the refugee situation is poorly charged. We're assessing his statement wrong.
