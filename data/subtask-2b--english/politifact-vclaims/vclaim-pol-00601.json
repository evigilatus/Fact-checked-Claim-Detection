Nicer people?\nMore lakes?\nNew state Tourism Secretary Sara Meaney stuck her toe into the lake dispute May 9, 2019 during an appearance on \"Wisconsin\u2019s Afternoon News\" on WTMJ radio.\n\"Wisconsin, many people may not be aware, actually has 15,000 freshwater lakes,\" she said.\n\"More than Minnesota?\" asked host John Mercure.\n\"More than Minnesota,\" said Meaney. \"Absolutely. We win. We win.\"\nMinnesota is the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes,\" as the state\u2019s license plates declare. But Wisconsin isn\u2019t exactly a desert.\nAs residents of both states head for the nearest body of water in droves this Memorial Day weekend, we thought we would, well, dive into this one.\n\nWho has more lakes?\nNot an easy question\nOur quest begins with the simplest version of this question.\nHey Wisconsin, how many lakes do you have?\n15,074, says the\u00a0Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.\nHey Minnesota, how many lakes do YOU have?\n11,842, says the\u00a0Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\nCongratulations, Wisconsin, you win?\nNope. It's not nearly that simple.\nWhat makes a lake?\nLet's start by figuring out what a lake is. Does a lake\u00a0have to have a name? Be a certain size? What if it\u2019s actually a flowage? (And what the heck is a\u00a0flowage?) What about intermittent lakes, that come and go by season (as opposed to year-round lakes)?\nMinnesota defines a lake as a body of water greater than 10 acres. That\u2019s how it got the 11,482 number in its Public Waters Inventory.\nWisconsin defines a lake as, well, anything it feels like calling a lake. Thousands are less than 10 acres. Of the 15,074 \"documented lakes\" in the state, 60% don\u2019t even have a name.\nIf we use Wisconsin\u2019s lake database and apply the same 10-acre standard as Minnesota, Wisconsin has only 5,898 lakes. But the two state databases have different criteria for inclusion so this alone doesn\u2019t settle our debate.\nPeter Boulay, a climatologist with the Minnesota DNR, said different agencies use different definitions of lake for their own purposes, but there is no nationally accepted definition. He deferred to Paul S. Welch, a University of Michigan professor who in 1935 literally\u00a0wrote the book on limnology \u2014 the study of lakes and other bodies of fresh water.\nWelch\u00a0wrote that generally accepted definitions of lake describe \"a body of standing water completely isolated from the sea and having an area of open, relatively deep water sufficiently large to produce somewhere on its periphery a barren, wave-swept shore.\"\nBut he pointed out unique lake shapes and makeup create problems for this definition and chose instead to define lakes by exclusion. Welch said ponds are \"very small, very shallow bodies of standing water in which quiet water and extensive occupancy by higher aquatic plants are common.\"\nAnything larger, he said, is a lake.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Geological Survey doesn\u2019t officially define lakes.\nIts\u00a0National Hydrography Dataset merges lakes and ponds into a single category. And the agency notes at least 54 generic terms have characteristics similar to a lake. Examples include a basin, a pond, a reservoir and a flowage (water accumulated upstream from a dam).\nChoosing a consistent definition\nMeaney\u2019s office wasn\u2019t much help on the definition issue. When we reached out seeking backup for the claim, spokesman Craig Trost shared this via email:\n\"Three facts are undeniable:\n1. Minnesota boasts more than 10,000 lakes.\n2. Wisconsin boasts more than 15,000 lakes.\n3. 15,000 is larger than 10,000.\"\nOf course, that just puts us back where we began.\nStill, our pursuit is not hopeless. We just need to use the same measuring stick for each side.\nWe turned to\u00a0Stephen Aichele, a geographer with the U.S. Geological Survey. He used the National Hydrography Dataset \u2014 which combines all inland water bodies into a lake/pond category \u2014 to compare Wisconsin and Minnesota bodies of water using various thresholds.\nAnd, in Aichele\u2019s words, \"each variant of the question comes up the same way.\"\nBased on the federal data:\n\u2014 Minnesota has 124,662 lake/pond features, while Wisconsin has 82,099.\n\u2014 Minnesota has 8,784 lake/pond features with a name, while Wisconsin has 5,481.\n\u2014 Minnesota has 14,444 lake/pond features of 10 acres or more, while Wisconsin has 6,176.\nFor context, 10 acres is about seven-and-a-half football fields (including end zones). That\u2019s also the cutoff Minnesota uses to define lakes.\nUsing a 25-acre cut off, Minnesota also has more than twice as many lakes \u2014 8,466 to 3,350.\nThe lake measures that Wisconsin wins\nFear not, Wisconsin readers.\nOur research did uncover a couple lake metrics where Minnesota is lacking.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nDeepest lake: The deepest natural lake in either state is Green Lake in central Wisconsin, with a maximum depth of 236 feet. That\u2019s 27 feet deeper than Minnesota\u2019s deepest entry, Ten Mile Lake. (Wisconsin\u2019s Wazee Lake in Jackson County is a whopping 350 feet at its deepest, but it\u2019s a manmade lake made from an abandoned iron mine.)\nSurface area: Wisconsin also dominates in the percentage of surface area covered by lakes, with 17% compared to 8% for Minnesota.\nOf course, that tally is dramatically skewed by the inclusion of Lake Michigan on the Wisconsin side of the ledger, which vastly outstrips the small corner of Lake Superior claimed by Minnesota.\nRemoving the Great Lakes from the equation, Minnesota has 5.4% of its surface area covered by lakes compared to 2.7% for Wisconsin.\nMinnesota also has the largest lake, with Red Lake (288,000 acres) easily topping Wisconsin\u2019s Lake Winnebago (137,708).\nOur ruling\nMeaney claimed Wisconsin boasts more than 15,000 lakes \u2014 \"more than Minnesota.\"\nBut those numbers use vastly different definitions of \"lake,\" with thousands counting toward the tally in Wisconsin that wouldn\u2019t meet the definition in Minnesota. If both states used Minnesota\u2019s 10-acre minimum standard \u2014 or really any other reasonable metric \u2014 Minnesota has about twice as many lakes.\nWe rate Meaney\u2019s statement False.\nBut we\u2019ll still give the tourism department\u2019s spokesman the last word here:\n\"At the end of the day,\" Trost said, \"we are happy to let Minnesota count their lakes and their Super Bowl championships, and we\u2019ll count our own.\"\n Share the Facts 2019-05-23 16:26:06 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Wisconsin, many people may not be aware, actually has 15,000 freshwater lakes. \u2026 More than Minnesota.\"    Sara Meaney Wisconsin Tourism Secretary http://www.wtmj.com/shows/travel-wisconsin/travel-wisconsin-boating/1079760473   Radio interview Thursday, May 9, 2019 2019-05-09    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00601"}
