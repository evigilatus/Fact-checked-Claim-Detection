Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, over an overprescription scandal at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\nIn response, Baldwin launched her own campaign ad featuring the parents of late Marine Jason Simcakoski that claims that -- in the wake of the death -- Baldwin \"brought both parties together to help pass a law\" to \"make the VA accountable and also to stop the overprescribing of\" opioids.\nThat\u2019s what we want to look at here.\nThe background\nTo be sure, Baldwin\u2019s ad sidesteps what happened in Tomah and the role she and her office played in handling information from a whistleblower.\nAs we have noted in earlier items:\n\n\nProblems at the Tomah VA first made news in January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. Doctors had been handing out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans had taken to calling the place \"Candy Land.\"\n\n\nPrior to that, on Aug. 29, 2014, Baldwin\u2019s office received a report from the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Office of Inspector General following a 2\u00bd-year investigation of Tomah. Baldwin did not make the report public, though she shared it with a constituent who had complained to her about what was happening at Tomah. The report was not given to any other member of Congress at the time.\n\n\nA day later, Simcakoski died of a \"mixed use toxicity\" overdose at the Tomah VA while being treated by doctors there. Simcakoski had checked himself into the facility citing an addiction to painkillers and severe anxiety. He was prescribed 15 drugs, including anti-psychotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and the opioid painkiller tramadol.\n\n\nIn fact, after months of criticism about inaction on a whistleblower\u2019s complaints about Tomah, Baldwin acknowledged her office had made mistakes, leading her to fire one staffer, demote another and dock the pay of her chief of staff.\n\n\nVukmir has hammered Baldwin for months over the issue.\nDuring a September 2018 appearance on \u00a0\"Capital City Sunday\" on WKOW-TV, she said Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation \"to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids\" at the Tomah VA, \"later a veteran died\" and Baldwin \"covered it up.\"\nWe rated Vukmir\u2019s overall claim Mostly False.\nWe found that Baldwin was the only one with the report and that she didn\u2019t make the report public or go public with her concerns until the scandal made news. But she received the report only a day before the veteran died and -- while she did not publicize it -- an investigation by the U.S. Senate Ethics Select Committee into allegations of a coverup found the complaints lacked merit.\nNow to Baldwin\u2019s claim\nWhat happened next\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her claim, Baldwin is referring to legislation she co-authored -- the \"Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act.\" On the campaign trail, Baldwin has referred to it as \"Jason\u2019s Law.\"\nAnd that\u2019s what Baldwin\u2019s campaign pointed to when we asked for evidence to support her claim.\n\"Jason\u2019s Law includes multiple measures designed to hold the VA system more accountable for the care of veterans and provide stricter opioid prescription guidelines,\" said campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt. \"Since being signed into law, Jason\u2019s Law has helped improve the VA, where they\u2019ve seen lower opioid prescribing rates and increased numbers of physicians who receive updated training.\"\nNow to the specifics:\nBipartisan bill: According to a June 22, 2015 news release, Baldwin and U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., introduced the initial measure. The news release shows supporters at the time included 11 other senators -- nine of them Democrats and two of them Republicans. Among the Republicans: Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.\nA July 13, 2016 report from WSAW TV and the Associated Press said Baldwin\u2019s bill and one from U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, a Wisconsin Democrat, were included in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, made up of 12 bills.\nThat measure passed the Senate in a 94-1 vote. On July 22, 2016, President Obama signed the package into law.\nJohnson himself referred to the measure as \"a bipartisan step.\"\nVA accountability/overprescribing: That portion of the claim is supported by a May 9, 2018 appearance by VA Deputy Under Secretary Carolyn Clancy on C-SPAN.\nIn the interview, Clancy said \"we\u2019ve seen a 47 percent decrease in the number of veterans on chronic opioids in Tomah, which is a little ahead of the national average. We\u2019ve made great progress overall. For the proportion of patients on both a benzodiazepine and an opioid, which has a very high risk of adverse events, the decrease has been 76 percent at Tomah which is a little bit ahead of the national decrease.\"\nIn April 2018, the Tomah VA became one of 18 veterans hospitals across the country involved in the \"Whole Health\" program. The program considers the physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and environmental elements that work together to provide the best quality of life for each veteran, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs.\n\"We will never eradicate the need for opioids, but I think by combining it with the nontraditional therapy and taking the whole look at the veteran and veterans' needs, we will be able to manage pain and still let the veterans have a quality of life that they need,\" Victoria Brahm, director of the Tomah VA, said in an April 23, 2018 Associated Press story.\nSo, on the narrow points of Baldwin\u2019s claim, she is on target -- even as she ignores missteps by her office that could have mitigated the problems.\nAlec Zimmerman, spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said Baldwin had left \"our state\u2019s heroes in danger\" and that rather than taking immediate action \"was trying to save her political future.\"\nOur rating\nA Baldwin campaign ad claims she \"brought both parties together to help pass a law\" to \"make the VA accountable and also to stop the overprescribing of\" opioids.\nThe action came only after the overprescription scandal made headlines -- something ignored in the ad. Likewise, the ad sidesteps key missteps by Baldwin\u2019s own office.\nNevertheless, the claims in this ad are narrowly drawn.\nWe rate Baldwin\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01326"}
