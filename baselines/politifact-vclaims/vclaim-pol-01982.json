But one part of the letter that caught our eye is an assertion about how the White House responded to media disclosures of a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and Russian nationals. This meeting, involving Trump's eldest son and first reported by the New York Times, has attracted intense interest from Mueller\u2019s investigators, as well as from congressional committees.\nThe lawyers\u2019 memo acknowledged that President Trump had indeed dictated an initial statement to the New York Times. It went on to defend the president's message as \"short but accurate.\"\n\"You have received all of the notes, communications and testimony indicating that the President dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump Jr.,\" said the Jan. 29, 2018, letter from attorneys Jay Sekulow and John Dowd.\nHowever, the original explanation for the meeting was not as accurate as the lawyers\u2019 asserted.\nThe statement from Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting focused \"primarily\" on Russian adoptions. But while the adoptions were indeed mentioned at the meeting, there is evidence that the broader topic of sanctions against well-connected Russians under the Magnitsky Act received significant attention.\nThe statement also offered incomplete characterizations of how much Trump Jr. knew about meeting participants and what he expected to get out of it, and it ignored later efforts by the Russian side to follow up on the meeting.\nThe White House did not respond to multiple inquiries for this article, and a separate inquiry to Sekulow was not returned.\nTrump Tower tick-tock\nAn email chain to coordinate the meeting shows that Donald Trump Jr. accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his father\u2019s campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The younger Trump forwarded the email chain to the candidate\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, his campaign chair at the time. All three Trump campaign officials ended up attending the meeting on June 9, 2016.\nOne of the participants was Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was described in an email to Trump Jr. as a \"Russian government attorney.\" Veselnitskaya has represented Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior government official, according to the New York Times.\nOther participants included Russian-American Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet soldier with experience in military counterintelligence, and Georgian-American Ike Kaveladze, who was once the subject of a congressional inquiry into Russian money-laundering through the U.S. banking system.\nThe meeting became public knowledge after the New York Times reported on it 13 months later. For that article, Donald Trump Jr. gave the newspaper a statement (the one that is central to this fact-check):\n\"It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.\"\nThat statement was later supplanted by other, conflicting statements from the Trump camp, including contradictions about whether Donald Trump himself dictated the statement in the name of his son \u2014 which his lawyers now say he did.\nThe question of adoptions\nThe most misleading part of the statement is that the meeting \"primarily\" entailed \"a program about the adoption of Russian children.\" While that topic did come up in the meeting, the statement leaves out an apparently detailed discussion of the 2012 Magnitsky Act sanctions, as well as \"dirt\" on Bill Browder, the businessman who had pushed for the act.\nVeselnitskaya came to the meeting armed with talking points that were primarily critcisms of the Magnitsky Act that placed strong sanctions on prominent Russians and which Putin and his allies have worked hard to quash.\nVeselnitskaya\u2019s five pages of talking points only mentioned \"adoptions\" in passing at the end, saying that the law \"became a basis for open confrontation between our countries, complicating relations on all key geopolitical issues and leading to the ban on Americans adopting Russian children.\"\nUnder questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 transcripts of which have been released publicly \u2014 Trump Jr., Kaveladze and Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump who helped organize the meeting and attended it, said that adoptions were discussed at the meeting.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Jr., for instance, testified that \"it started off with that sort of tax scheme (about the Democratic National Committee) and, you know, quickly migrated to Russian adoption and ultimately the Magnitsky Act.\"\nThe evidence suggests that the other topics took up a significant portion of the meeting.\nKaveladze testified that Veselnitskaya offered remarks in the meeting \"about Magnitsky Act and about destructive role played by Bill Browder, the initiator of that act, in ruining relationship between U.S. and Russia. \u2026 She also suggested that the repeal of that act could significantly improve the relationship between Russia and the U.S.\"\nAt some point, Akhmetshin \"gave a little bit more details\" on this argument and segued into the act\u2019s impact on adoptions, Kaveladze testified.\nAlso in the meeting, Kaveladze added, Veselnitskaya talked at some length about the owners of Browder\u2019s company being major Democratic donors and how that could be \"a negative for the Democratic Party.\"\nThis account is supported by a page of notes taken by Manafort and released by the committee. The document includes 11 bullet points, including \"Bill Browder,\" \"Offshore - Cyprus,\" \"Active sponsors of RNC,\" and, only as the final bullet point, \"Russian adoption by American families.\"\n\"If it\u2019s what you say I love it\"\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that adoptions were hardly the meeting\u2019s draw for the Trump camp, according to emails Trump Jr. released three days after the initial New York Times story.\nThe meeting was set in motion on June 3, 2016, when Trump Jr. received an email from Goldstone. He informed the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father\u2019s candidacy, and told of his connection to a Russian government official with incriminating evidence against Clinton.\n\"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump,\" Goldstone told Trump Jr.\nThe younger Trump replied: \"If it\u2019s what you say I love it.\"\nOther points of context\nSeveral other elements of the statement paint an incomplete picture. One is the question of whether there was follow-up after the meeting.\nThat may be true for actions by the Trump side. Trump Jr. has said that he \"never discussed the meeting again\" with Goldstone or fellow meeting organizer Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov. He also told Fox News\u2019 Hannity that Goldstone apologized about the likely \"bait and switch about what it was really supposed to be about.\"\nHowever, there is evidence that the other side tried to reach out to the Trump campaign on more than one occasion. For instance, congressional investigators obtained an email from Goldstone to Trump aide Dan Scavino that \"encourages Scavino to get candidate Trump to create a page on the Russian social networking site VK, telling him that \u2018Don and Paul\u2019 were on board with the idea,\" a reference to Trump Jr. and Manafort, CNN reported in December 2017.\nIn addition, there were attempts at outreach after the election, CNN reported in April 2018.\nGoldstone told congressional investigators that he proposed a second meeting with Veselnitskaya, the New York Times reported. Goldstone sent an email on Nov. 28, 2016, to Trump's assistant, Rhona Graff, that said, \"Aras Agalarov has asked me to pass on this document in the hope it can be passed on to the appropriate team.\" The email, which had an attachment about the Magnitsky Act, was forwarded to then-Trump adviser Steve Bannon with the notation, \"Not sure how to proceed, if at all,\" CNN reported. A meeting never took place.\nAnother area where the statement tells only part of the story is its claim that Trump Jr. was not told a specific name in advance. While we found no evidence that he knew a name in advance, Trump Jr. possessed a fair amount of more general information, judging by the email chain with Goldstone that was made public.\nThe first email in the chain said in part, \"Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.\"\nLater in the email chain, Goldstone wrote, \"Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday.\"\nOur ruling\nThe White House legal document said that then-candidate Trump \"dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article\" about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians.\nThe accuracy of the statement was misleading, at least.\nThe statement's most inaccurate suggestion was that the meeting was primarily about Russian adoptions. That wasn't what the Trump officials came to hear about, and adoptions weren't atop the list of topics for the Russian figures, either. There was a significant amount of discussion about the Magnitsky Act sanctions and allegations of wrongdoing by the act\u2019s champion.\nFurther, the initial statement obscured what we now know about Trump Jr.\u2019s motivation for taking the meeting: the prospect of compromising material on Clinton from the Russians.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-06-07 19:21:26 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Say President Donald Trump \"dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article\" about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians.
