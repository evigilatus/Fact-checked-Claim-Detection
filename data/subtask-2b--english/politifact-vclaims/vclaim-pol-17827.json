John Cornyn in November.\nHegar celebrated her primary election win with a virtual victory party hosted on Facebook, with appearances from state officials and members of the Texas Democratic Party.\nDuring the event, Hegar talked about the coronavirus and its impact in Texas, stating that \"we had a health care crisis in this state before COVID-19.\"\n\"Before the pandemic, nearly 1 in every 5 was without access to health care coverage,\" Hegar said. \"And now: 1 in 3. Nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don\u2019t have access to health care insurance because of the record unemployment and because of our health care model that is failing Texas.\"\nTexas consistently ranks as the state with the highest uninsured rates, but is Hegar right about the number of people without insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic?\nPre-pandemic insurance levels\nHegar\u2019s campaign shared multiple news articles about Texans without health insurance published before and during the pandemic, including recent reporting from the Houston Chronicle highlighting how job losses are leading to a growing population of uninsured Texans.\nLet\u2019s start with the rate of uninsured Texans before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Kaiser Health Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization, publishes state health facts using detailed data from the Census Bureau, including the insurance status of people under 65 in Texas.\nMore than 4.8 million people under 65 are uninsured \u2014 about 19.9% of the population that age, or about 1 in 5 people, according to the latest Census Bureau data published in 2019.\nOf those Texans who are insured, about 66% are covered through their employer and 21.6% are covered by Medicaid.\nTexas is one of 13 states that has not expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which allows people between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (considered middle class) to receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance plans purchased through an online marketplace.\nThe act also grants free coverage under Medicaid to anyone earning less than 138% of the federal poverty level (which this year is $26,200 for a family of four) in states that have opted to expand the program.\nSince Texas has not expanded the program, eligibility requirements for the program are more strict and are not based solely on income. In order to qualify, a person must have an annual income below a certain threshold ($51,876 for a family of four) and be pregnant, be a parent or caretaker of children, have a disability or a family member with a disability or be 65 years or older.\nPandemic insurance levels\nSince Texas first shut down segments of the economy to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the unemployment rate has fluctuated, spiking to a record 13.5% in April before falling to 8.6% in June.\nFor comparison, in June of 2019 the unemployment rate in Texas was 3.4%.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs people lost their jobs, many also lost their health insurance coverage. The actual calculation of the number of people without coverage is a moving target, as people find new jobs or secure coverage elsewhere after becoming unemployed.\nBut two national studies show that between 650,000 and 1.6 million Texans could have lost coverage since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn May, the Kaiser Health Foundation released a report estimating the number of people losing job-based health insurance coverage during the pandemic and how many of those individuals are eligible for coverage through Medicaid or through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace tax credits.\nNationally, the report estimates that as many as 26.8 million people will become uninsured, including workers, adult dependents and children. Of those, the report estimates that half are eligible for coverage through Medicaid and others through tax credits.\nIn Texas, that report estimates that 1.6 million people will lose insurance coverage, which would bring the state\u2019s uninsured rate to about 26.5% for people under 65 \u2014 or about 1 in 4 people without health insurance coverage.\nBut these figures don\u2019t speak exactly to Hegar\u2019s claim, which is about the number of people who \"don\u2019t have access to insurance.\"\u00a0\nEven though Texas has opted not to expand Medicaid coverage to people with incomes below the poverty line, the report states that unemployment benefits and the temporary $600 weekly payments approved by Congress are likely to push annual income for many of these unemployed workers to levels that would make them eligible for Medicaid coverage in Texas.\nThis means they will be able to access Medicaid coverage and marketplace tax credits for the remainder of the calendar year.\nOther people who lose coverage could switch to insurance offered through a spouse\u2019s or parents\u2019 employer and others may qualify for coverage but opt not to enroll, according to the report.\nSo even though an estimated 1 in 4 Texans will now be without health insurance coverage, the actual number of people who are uninsured and \"don\u2019t have access to healthcare insurance\" is likely even lower.\nA July report from Families USA, a research and advocacy non-profit that supports policies that make healthcare more accessible, offers a closer estimate.\u00a0\nThe report tried to pin down the number of uninsured adults who would be unable to obtain new health insurance coverage after losing employment during the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe report estimates that about 5.4 million people across the country became uninsured after losing their jobs between February and May of this year and could not find new coverage.\nIn Texas, an estimated 659,000 adult workers lost insurance coverage after losing jobs and could not find coverage elsewhere, bringing the rate of uninsured adults in the state at the end of May to 29%, or about 1 in 3 adults, the report found.\nBut these figures are just about workers, and don\u2019t account for children and other dependents who may have been covered by another adult\u2019s health insurance plan through an employer, which means the total number of people who are uninsured is likely higher than this estimate.\nOur ruling\nHegar said 1 in 5 Texans did not have health insurance coverage before the pandemic, and now \"nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don\u2019t have access to health care insurance.\"\nHegar is right about how many Texans under 65 were previously uninsured. The number of Texans without access to health insurance during the pandemic is harder to pin down, but her \"nearly 1 in 3\" remark reflects the latest available estimates.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17827"}
