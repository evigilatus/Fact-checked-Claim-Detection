Mark Warner, D-Va., who recently introduced a bill that would require the Social Security Administration to do a better job of tracking the departed to make sure their federal benefits don\u2019t survive.\n\"The SSA (Social Security Administration\u2019s) Office of the Inspector General reported last month that, according to the agency\u2019s own records, there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older,\" Warner said in an April 23 news release.\nThat\u2019s more than twice the of population of Chicago -- filled with people at least 112. It\u2019s especially remarkable when you consider that the Gerontology Research Group says it knew of 42 people in the world who were alive last October at 112 or older. Fifteen of them lived in the U.S.\nThe immortal Social Security numbers, Warner said, open avenues for fraudulent benefit claims.\nWe wondered whether the senator\u2019s Social Security figures were correct.\nWarner\u2019s office pointed us to a March 4 report issued by Patrick O\u2019Carroll Jr., the Social Security Administration\u2019s inspector general. O\u2019Carroll testified about the agency\u2019s death records during a March 16 hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He stated that the agency maintains an electronic record on each person given a Social Security number and is supposed to update it when they die so their number can no longer be used.\nThe agency gets its death information from a variety of sources, such as family members, funeral homes and financial institutions. It maintains a \"Death Master File\" with nearly 90 million electronic records that\u2019s shared with other federal agencies to prevent erroneous benefits and sold to credit reporting companies to guard against fraud.\nSometimes the Social Security Administration prematurely declares people dead, as recently reported on CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, causing bureaucratic nightmares when those people try to open bank accounts or do myriad other things requiring a valid Social Security number. The agency\u2019s internal auditor found in 2008 that 20,000 people had been wrongly listed as dead.\nAnd sometimes the opposite is true, O'Carroll said in his testimony, and the agency fails to take away Social Security numbers from the dead -- even when \u00a0the agency has been informed of the deaths.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt all came to a head a few years ago when O'Carroll\u2019s office learned that a bank reported that a man had opened accounts using the Social Security numbers of two different people -- one born in 1886 and the other in 1893. The auditors did a little research and found that the world\u2019s oldest living man at the time was 112. So they chose the age as the entry point of their investigation.\nThe auditors indeed found, as Warner claimed, that 6.5 million cardholders were listed in Social Security records as being at least 112. All but about 100,000 of the numbers were issued prior to 1972, when the agency started using electronic records.\nThe good news is that the auditors found no instances of people illegally collecting Social Security through one of these old numbers. The bad news is that the potential for abuse is high and, according to the report, \"thousands\" of the numbers \"could have been used\" to commit other types of identity fraud.\nAuditors found that 66,920 of the numbers had been used by people for whom the government received wage reports from 2006 and 2011. One of the numbers appeared on 613 different wage reports.\nThat means people were using the numbers in job applications and 3,873 of the numbers turned up in E-Verify inquiries, an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine whether potential hirees are entitled by immigration laws to work in the U.S.\nFinal notes: If you\u2019re wondering, the verified oldest person in the world at this writing is Jeralean Talley of Michigan, whose 116th birthday is on May 23. \u00a0The oldest man is Sakari Momoi of Japan, who turned 112 in February.\nThe verified oldest person ever was Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at 122 years, 164 days old. The oldest man was Christian Mortensen of Denmark, who died in 1998 at 115 years, 252 days.\nOur ruling\nWarner said the Social Security Administration\u2019s Inspector General found \"there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older.\"\nThe audit Warner cites indeed found that there are an implausible 6.5 million active Social Security numbers belonging to people who would be at least 112.\nWe rate Warner\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06430"}
