20121023_third_presidential_debate_0985	The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middleincome families, now down $4,300 during your term, 23 million Americans still struggling to find a good job.

20121023_third_presidential_debate_0088	Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that alQaida's a threat because a few months ago when you were asked, what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia  not alQaida, you said Russia.
20121023_third_presidential_debate_0459	But what you can't do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts, you say that you're going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions without naming what those loopholes and deductions are, and then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.
20121023_third_presidential_debate_0605	And then the president began what I've called an apology tour of going to  to various nations in the Middle East and  and criticizing America.
20121023_third_presidential_debate_0684	But when you were a candidate in 2008  as I was  and I said, if I got bin Laden in our sights, I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man, and you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.
20121023_third_presidential_debate_0884	You are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas, because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas.

20151028_GOP_boulder_0842	Well, you just  you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
20151028_GOP_boulder_0949	This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10year relationship.
20151028_GOP_boulder_0950	They offered claims that they could cure autism, cancer, they paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet you're involvement continued.
20151028_GOP_boulder_0958	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
20151028_GOP_boulder_0744	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.

20151110_GOP_milwuakee_0888	We're losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China, $75 billion a year imbalance with Japan.
20151110_GOP_milwuakee_0875	It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.
20151110_GOP_milwuakee_0656	There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible  and  and not a one of them is as good.
20151110_GOP_milwuakee_0566	I understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a preexisting condition.
20151110_GOP_milwuakee_0567	I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help.
20151110_GOP_milwuakee_0568	But, I also understand that Obamacare isn't helping anyone.
20151110_GOP_milwuakee_0313	But, you know, when I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video.
20160112_Obama_state_of_the_union_0013	And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.
20160112_Obama_state_of_the_union_0076	We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.
20160112_Obama_state_of_the_union_0145	That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo it's expensive, it's unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.
20160112_Obama_state_of_the_union_0071	I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air.
20160112_Obama_state_of_the_union_0072	Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.
20160112_Obama_state_of_the_union_0073	The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.
20160115_GOP_charlston_0192	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor  very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.

20160115_GOP_charlston_0195	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?

20160115_GOP_charlston_0473	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
20160115_GOP_charlston_0138	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
20160115_GOP_charlston_0139	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
20160115_GOP_charlston_0740	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
20160115_GOP_charlston_0047	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
20160115_GOP_charlston_0048	Median wages have stagnated.
20160115_GOP_charlston_0049	And the ObamaClinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
20160115_GOP_charlston_1591	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
20160115_GOP_charlston_1616	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
20160115_GOP_charlston_1579	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.

20160117_democrats_charlston_0413	We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years.
20160117_democrats_charlston_0414	Now we've got to get individual costs down.
20160117_democrats_charlston_0129	Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation.
20160117_democrats_charlston_0122	He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole.
20160117_democrats_charlston_0994	Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union.
20160117_democrats_charlston_0995	Very little of that budget  less than 10 percent  actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.
20160204_democrats_new_hampshire_0623	A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders's views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there putting them right at the doorstep of Israel.
20160204_democrats_new_hampshire_0024	They're worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.
20160204_democrats_new_hampshire_1062	Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages.
20160204_democrats_new_hampshire_1032	I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration.

20160211_democrats_milwuakee_0332	As I understand it, the AfricanAmerican community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
20160211_democrats_milwuakee_0909	He has called him a disappointment.
20160213_GOP_greenville_0210	But we have to  I'm the only one on this stage that said "Do not go into Iraq.
20160213_GOP_greenville_0210	But we have to  I'm the only one on this stage that said "Do not go into Iraq.
20160213_GOP_greenville_0212	Nobody else on this stage said that.
20160213_GOP_greenville_0216	But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, "You'll destabilize the Middle East."
20160213_GOP_greenville_1002	I didn't say that I was going to moon somebody...
20160213_GOP_greenville_1528	Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.
20160225_GOP_texas_1801	He said I was in favor of Libya?
20160225_GOP_texas_1172	And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.
20160225_GOP_texas_1173	What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless.
20160225_GOP_texas_0120	As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration.
20160225_GOP_texas_0121	It wouldn't even be a big subject.
20160225_GOP_texas_0962	When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare.
20160225_GOP_texas_0963	All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.
20160225_GOP_texas_0964	And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.
20160303_GOP_michigan_0237	I would like it clear though, since we're talking about polls, I beat Hillary Clinton by more than 11 points, and the reason it happens...
20160303_GOP_michigan_0418	This guy has a number one  the number one absentee record in the United States...
20160303_GOP_michigan_1158	Ninetyeight percent approval rating, we have an "A" from the Better Business Bureau...
20160303_GOP_michigan_0574	Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times.
20160303_GOP_michigan_0575	Ten times.
20160303_GOP_michigan_0940	Well, look, you know, when a family flies into the World Trade Center, a man flies into the World Trade Center, and his family gets sent back to where they were going  and I think most of you know where they went  and, by the way, it wasn't Iraq  but they went back to a certain territory, they knew what was happening.
20160303_GOP_michigan_0940	Well, look, you know, when a family flies into the World Trade Center, a man flies into the World Trade Center, and his family gets sent back to where they were going  and I think most of you know where they went  and, by the way, it wasn't Iraq  but they went back to a certain territory, they knew what was happening.
20160309_democrats_miami_0110	And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government.
20160309_democrats_miami_0241	Well, when we talk about efforts to assist immigrants, Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Elliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide driver's license to these who were undocumented, she said don't do it, and New York State still does not do it.
20160309_democrats_miami_0245	And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back.
20160309_democrats_miami_0778	If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed...
20160309_democrats_miami_0784	AfricanAmerican kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent.
20160309_democrats_miami_0784	AfricanAmerican kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent.
20160309_democrats_miami_0939	The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense.
20160311_GOP_miami_0844	On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians.
20160311_GOP_miami_0149	I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about.
20160329_kasich_milwuakee_0029	First of all, in virtually every national poll, I am the only one that beats Hillary Clinton consistently.
20160329_kasich_milwuakee_0259	And, by the way, were running a $2 billion surplus.
20160331_Cruz_Miluakee_0100	And when he did, he followed this bizarre pattern that he has followed for year after year after year where he refuses to say the words radical Islamic terrorism.
20160331_Cruz_Miluakee_0173	Lets be clear, how many hours of free media do CNN, and FOX, and every other station  you let him call in, and for a year  $2 billion dollars of free media
20160401_Trump_Milwaukee_0653	Its made because the politicians  by the way, Im selffunding.
20160401_Trump_Milwaukee_0334	I think that  you know, when I hear Obama get up and say the biggest threat to the world today is global warming, I say, is this guy kidding?
20160401_Trump_Milwaukee_0812	It sounded, when I was pressing Senator Cruz on it, sounded like he was saying he was saying hed have a hard time supporting somebody who went after his wife.
20160401_Trump_Milwaukee_0052	When she found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed.
20160404_Hillary_meet_the_press_0153	And I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against.
20160404_Hillary_meet_the_press_0174	But I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails.
20160415_NY_democratic_debate_0541	So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.
20160415_NY_democratic_debate_0300	Unfortunately  unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate.
20160415_NY_democratic_debate_0557	Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.
20160415_NY_democratic_debate_1183	They still want to privatize it.
20160415_NY_democratic_debate_0433	When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15.
20160415_NY_democratic_debate_0434	Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12.
20160415_NY_democratic_debate_1295	We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question.
20160417_meet_the_press_0059	But, you know, I think what's important and what I think the Clinton campaign has not been very good at explaining is this and this is the truth the overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising, is not going to Hillary to run for President, it's going to the downticket.
20160424_meet_the_press_0384	Well, because poor people don't vote.
20160508_Trump_meet_the_press_0366	Under my proposal, it's the biggest tax cut by far, of any candidate by far.
20160508_Trump_meet_the_press_0375	Remember this, we're the highest taxed nation in the world.
20160508_Trump_meet_the_press_0375	Remember this, we're the highest taxed nation in the world.
20160508_Trump_meet_the_press_0395	Our businesses pay more taxes than any businesses in the world.
20160508_Trump_meet_the_press_0394	We're the highest taxed nation in the world.
20160508_Trump_meet_the_press_0394	We're the highest taxed nation in the world.
20160529_Sanders_MeetThePress_0184	She voted for the War in Iraq.
20160529_Sanders_MeetThePress_0179	I want to break up the Wall Street banks.
20160529_Sanders_MeetThePress_0181	I want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.
20160529_Sanders_MeetThePress_0182	She wants $12 an hour.
20160529_Sanders_MeetThePress_0185	I believe we should ban fracking.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0022	Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar  just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total selfserving lie.

20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0064	Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property  a crime which is continuing to this day.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0065	Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0073	Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0074	She has even deleted this record of total support from her book  deletion is something she is very good at  (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0074	She has even deleted this record of total support from her book  deletion is something she is very good at  (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0084	He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed  that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0085	Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0086	Hillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0108	Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0108	Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0113	In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0114	Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth  with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0115	Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0130	Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0131	Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0141	She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.
20160622_Trump_NY_Soho_0151	For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.

20160901_Trump_immigration_Phoenix_0063	Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants  breaking the federal budget.
20160901_Trump_immigration_Phoenix_0048	The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants  or however many there may be.
20160901_Trump_immigration_Phoenix_0043	On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.

20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0073	Classified material has a header which says top secret, secret, confidential. Nothing  and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice  none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header.
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0165	Hes on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population.
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0221	And I do think there is an agenda out there, supported by my opponent, to do just that.
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0240	The population of veterans has a rate of suicide far above the general population.
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0241	Twenty  twenty suicides a day.
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0358	I was totally against the war in Iraq.
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0378	I was able to get more votes than anybody ever has gotten in the history of Republican politics.
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0439	And really, ISIS was formed.
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0545	I think its very sad, when you look at Barack Obama, as an example, lands Air Force One in China, and they dont want to put out stairs to get off the plane.
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0564	Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters, who, by the way, some of them are based right here.
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0571	Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, Ill take the compliment, OK?
20160907_NBC_commander_in_chief_forum_0611	And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, theres no real problem, its overexaggerated.
20160926_1pres_0064	Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.
20160926_1pres_0098	In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.
20160926_1pres_0165	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.
20160926_1pres_0166	He said, back in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."
20160926_1pres_0175	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middleclass families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.
20160926_1pres_0179	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.
20160926_1pres_0183	I do not say that.
20160926_1pres_0202	The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.
20160926_1pres_0203	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, sevenandahalf years, to be semi exact.
20160926_1pres_0232	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.
20160926_1pres_0252	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.
20160926_1pres_0264	You called it the gold standard of trade deals.
20160926_1pres_0265	You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.
20160926_1pres_0424	Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.
20160926_1pres_0440	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.
20160926_1pres_0493	Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.
20160926_1pres_0575	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.
20160926_1pres_0579	You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.
20160926_1pres_0629	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African American men, more than the next nine causes put together.
20160926_1pres_0645	In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.
20160926_1pres_0711	And it's just a fact that if you're a young AfricanAmerican man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.
20160926_1pres_0748	I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words superpredator about young black youth.
20160926_1pres_0819	They were pressing it very hard.
20160926_1pres_0868	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to AfricanAmericans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.
20160926_1pres_0927	And that's why I was so  I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.
20160926_1pres_1010	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.
20160926_1pres_1010	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.
20160926_1pres_1057	But I said they have to focus on terror, also.
20160926_1pres_1059	And that was  believe me  I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it  but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.
20160926_1pres_1079	I did not support the war in Iraq.
20160926_1pres_1148	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.
20160926_1pres_1182	They do not pay us.
20160926_1pres_1182	They do not pay us.
20160926_1pres_1214	China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.
20160926_1pres_1215	And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.
20160926_1pres_1222	One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.
20160926_1pres_1225	It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.
20160926_1pres_1326	But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...
20160926_1pres_1326	But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...
20161005_vice_pres_0075	And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States.
20161005_vice_pres_0050	We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change.
20161005_vice_pres_0097	These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.
20161005_vice_pres_0153	And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate...
20161005_vice_pres_0117	She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.
20161005_vice_pres_0179	I think the fact that  that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.
20161005_vice_pres_0184	He actually  he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.
20161005_vice_pres_0192	They want to expand it into a singlepayer program.
20161005_vice_pres_0215	First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.
20161005_vice_pres_0216	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.
20161005_vice_pres_0234	I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch.
20161005_vice_pres_0236	Fifteen million new jobs?
20161005_vice_pres_0305	Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.
20161005_vice_pres_0326	Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.
20161005_vice_pres_0437	But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident.
20161005_vice_pres_0438	And if you look at sentencing in this country, AfricanAmericans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates.
20161005_vice_pres_0497	Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving  that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak.
20161005_vice_pres_0497	Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving  that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak.

20161005_vice_pres_0639	He trash talks the military.
20161005_vice_pres_0639	He trash talks the military.
20161005_vice_pres_0640	The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them.
20161005_vice_pres_0640	The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them.
20161005_vice_pres_0965	More nations should get nuclear weapons.
20161005_vice_pres_0968	Well, he never said that, Senator.
20161005_vice_pres_0682	You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program.
20161005_vice_pres_0694	Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500...
20161005_vice_pres_0737	Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.
20161005_vice_pres_1039	we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.
20161005_vice_pres_1134	It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people.
20161005_vice_pres_1163	Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
20161005_vice_pres_1163	Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
20161005_vice_pres_1163	Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
20161005_vice_pres_1163	Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
20161005_vice_pres_1162	A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump?
20161005_vice_pres_1259	And that is the fundamental difference between a ClintonKaine ticket and a Trump Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.
20161005_vice_pres_1325	She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million lowincome kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.
20161010_2pres_0035	When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a onesided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.
20161010_2pres_0037	Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.
20161010_2pres_0039	We had an $800 billion deficit.
20161010_2pres_0112	We have seen him insult women.
20161010_2pres_0117	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.
20161010_2pres_0117	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.
20161010_2pres_0117	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.
20161010_2pres_0117	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.
20161010_2pres_0130	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.
20161010_2pres_0165	Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.
20161010_2pres_0190	Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal  he's another real winner that you have  and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.
20161010_2pres_0208	There has never been anything like this, where emails  and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.
20161010_2pres_0346	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.
20161010_2pres_0347	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.
20161010_2pres_0370	She wants to go to a singlepayer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.
20161010_2pres_0437	And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.
20161010_2pres_0439	As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.
20161010_2pres_0500	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.
20161010_2pres_0501	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.
20161010_2pres_0525	And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.
20161010_2pres_0534	I was against  I was against the war in Iraq.
20161010_2pres_0554	We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.
20161010_2pres_0605	But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.
20161010_2pres_0607	But I don't know Putin.
20161010_2pres_0675	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.
20161010_2pres_0772	Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.
20161010_2pres_0776	When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.
20161010_2pres_0834	But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.
20161010_2pres_0838	We are old.
20161010_2pres_0839	We're tired.
20161010_2pres_0840	We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.
20161010_2pres_0821	First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the socalled line in the sand, which...
20161010_2pres_0851	And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.
20161010_2pres_0858	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of dealmaking, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.
20161010_2pres_0981	And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.
20161010_2pres_0982	She called it the gold standard.
20161010_2pres_1035	And there's a lot of fear  in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.
20161010_2pres_1036	Bullying is up.
20161010_2pres_1069	We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.
20161010_2pres_1081	No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.
20161010_2pres_1168	Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.
20161019_3pres_0029	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.
20161019_3pres_0029	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.
20161019_3pres_0030	But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say The Supreme Court should represent all of us.
20161019_3pres_0048	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.
20161019_3pres_0078	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.
20161019_3pres_0074	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.
20161019_3pres_0139	And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.
20161019_3pres_0189	Hillary wants to give amnesty.
20161019_3pres_0190	She wants to have open borders.
20161019_3pres_0200	All of the problems  the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.
20161019_3pres_0201	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.
20161019_3pres_0228	He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.
20161019_3pres_0255	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
20161019_3pres_0256	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.

20161019_3pres_0339	She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.
20161019_3pres_0345	I don't know Putin.
20161019_3pres_0363	that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.
20161019_3pres_0366	We have 17  17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.
20161019_3pres_0424	advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.
20161019_3pres_0468	I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.
20161019_3pres_0485	Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickledown economics on steroids.
20161019_3pres_0490	Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.
20161019_3pres_0607	She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.
20161019_3pres_0609	She did call it the gold standard.
20161019_3pres_0655	Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.
20161019_3pres_0657	You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.
20161019_3pres_0659	It's gone, $6 billion.
20161019_3pres_0667	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.
20161019_3pres_0687	She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when  we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.
20161019_3pres_0688	She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.
20161019_3pres_0695	And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.
20161019_3pres_0699	Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.
20161019_3pres_0751	But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her emails, where she destroyed 33,000 emails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
20161019_3pres_0765	But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.
20161019_3pres_0423	Wrong.
20161019_3pres_0793	But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIVAIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.
20161019_3pres_0815	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.
20161019_3pres_0815	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.
20161019_3pres_0818	These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.
20161019_3pres_0820	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?
20161019_3pres_0820	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?
20161019_3pres_0832	And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six foot portrait of Donald.
20161019_3pres_0867	He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.
20161019_3pres_0877	And all of her donors  just about all of them  I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...
20161019_3pres_0918	If you look  excuse me, Chris  if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote  millions, this isn't coming from me  this is coming from Pew Report and other places  millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.
20161019_3pres_0942	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.
20161019_3pres_1036	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.
20161019_3pres_1037	I said it was a mistake.
20161019_3pres_1038	I've said that years ago.
20161019_3pres_1039	He has consistently denied what is...
20161019_3pres_1133	We gave them $150 billion back.
20161019_3pres_1277	It's  the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.
20161019_3pres_1329	We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0041	It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0172	And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0203	I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0259	I didn't have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a noconflict situation because I'm president, which is  I didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0266	So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0270	But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company  the country.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0287	First of all, you learn very little to a tax return.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0277	But every president since the '70's has had a required audit from the IRS, the last place to release them, but as president sir...
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0278	You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK?
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0387	Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0388	It's not an emolument.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0450	Some states have over a hundred percent increase and '17 and I said this two years ago, '17 is going to be the bad year.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0483	And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0498	And you'd have millions more workers right now in the United States that are  96 million really wanting a job and they can't get.
20170111_Trump_press_conference_0498	And you'd have millions more workers right now in the United States that are  96 million really wanting a job and they can't get.

20170120_Trump_inauguration_0040	We have defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
20170120_Trump_inauguration_0041	And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
20170120_Trump_inauguration_0039	For many decades, we have enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.

20170126_Trump_ABC_0121	When you say in your opinion millions of illegal votes, that is something that is extremely fundamental to our functioning democracy, a fair and free election.
20170126_Trump_ABC_0133	And he told me that they found no evidence of voter fraud.
20170126_Trump_ABC_0178	You don't think it undermines your credibility if there's no evidence?
20170126_Trump_ABC_0180	Because they wouldn't  they didn't come to me, believe me.
20170126_Trump_ABC_0679	Now, the audience was the biggest ever.
20170126_Trump_ABC_0680	But this crowd was massive.
20170126_Trump_ABC_0319	And the answer was Yes, absolutely.

20170205_Trump_Oreilly_0141	I've been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.

20170205_Trump_Oreilly_0354	But if you say for example that there are three million illegal aliens who voted and then, you don't have the data to back it up, some people is going to say, that is irresponsible for a president to say that.
20170205_Trump_Oreilly_0360	And when you look at the registration, and you see dead people that have voted, that are on many, many dead people are on that have voted, when you see people that are registered in two states that voted in two states, when you see other things, when you see illegals, people that are not citizens, and they are on the registration rolls.

20170207_Sanders_Cruz_healthcare_debate_0041	The United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right.
20170207_Sanders_Cruz_healthcare_debate_0624	And if you believe health care is a right, why on Earth did you help write Obamacare that caused six million people to have their health insurance canceled, that had them lose their doctors, and have people like LaRonda, who can't get health insurance, can't afford premiums...
20170207_Sanders_Cruz_healthcare_debate_0265	Most of the people covered by Obamacare are on Medicaid.
20170207_Sanders_Cruz_healthcare_debate_0314	There are many people in America struggling with exactly what you are, in the wreckage of Obamacare, with skyrocketing premiums, with deductibles that are unaffordable, and with really limited care.
20170207_Sanders_Cruz_healthcare_debate_0360	Indeed, I don't know if the cameras can see this, but in 70 percent of the counties in America, on Obamacare exchanges, you have a choice of one or two health insurance plans, that's it, 70 percent of the counties in America.
20170207_Sanders_Cruz_healthcare_debate_0521	We should not be spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other nation.

20170207_Sanders_Cruz_healthcare_debate_0484	29ers are the millions of people across this country that have been forced into parttime work that used to have fulltime employment and are now working 29 hours a week because Obamacare kicks in at 30 hours a week.
20170207_Sanders_Cruz_healthcare_debate_0687	And so it may be working well with you, but I'll tell you nationally, the health outcomes under Medicaid are really poor.

20170207_Sanders_Cruz_healthcare_debate_0936	Last point on this issues, if we repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are going to provide $346 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent.
20170207_Sanders_Cruz_healthcare_debate_0123	Bernie helped write Obamacare.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0105	We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0106	I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0177	In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0178	I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0448	People  I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0036	The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0037	And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is  to me means something much different than it used to.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0722	We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0277	Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0471	Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0543	And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0469	I have nothing to do with Russia.
20170216_Trump_press_conference_0963	Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years.

20170224_Tump_CPAC_0200	Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.
20170224_Tump_CPAC_0223	But it was a little rigged against him, you know, super delegate, super delegate.
20170224_Tump_CPAC_0224	She had so many delegates before the thing even started, I actually said to my people, how does that happen?
20170224_Tump_CPAC_0261	In the Middle East, we've spent as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion.
20170224_Tump_CPAC_0422	No one will dare question as they have been because we're very depleted, very, very depleted.
20170224_Tump_CPAC_0257	We're getting bad ones out, those are the ones that go first and I said it from day one.
20170224_Tump_CPAC_0337	As we speak today, immigration offers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out of our country.
