This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Close readers (not close) will have realized that undocumented migrants do not have citizenship in the United States. We contacted the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to ask whether Carson, who swore to lead the department in March 2017, had ever said \"illegal immigrants arrested to vote must be deprived of their nationality.\" A spokesman for the Agency stated that he had not responded to the e-mail of Politi Fact. Nor did he respond to the questions of Politi Fact about a column written by Carson in 2014. We discovered the column after the search and failed to find a legitimate source of the permit. While Carson does not mention in the column what this article attributes, there is a similarity. \"Any person arrested involved in voter fraud must be deported immediately and his citizenship revoked,\" wrote Carson, who went to launch the 2016 Republican presidential candidacy. Among other things, MSNBC has passed. \"Ben Carson: De-nationalization of non-citizens voting,\" headline November 13, 2014, tells the story before questioning the logic behind Carson's idea. \"If these are non-citizens, as the context suggests, how can their nationality be revoked? If they're citizens, where are they being deported?\" The story of MSNBC refers to the WND.com column published in November 11, 2014: \"General Feeling Description for Migration Reform.\" When we visited the site on February 5, the line was no longer in the column. However, it also appears in Carson 2015, \"What I believe: a set of pillars of my union,\" under the title \"For as long as the United States.\" \"Commanders play the game of order, and they will become illegal.\" Let us look at the sentence in its context. Carson said: \"The special fact-checking records mentioned on January 12, 2021 in Instagram says that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in the Black Lives Mater demonstrations. By Tom Kircher \u2022 January 16, 2021 \"As long as we reward people who break the rules, they will continue to break the rules. We need a steady flow of migrants, but the chosen need not beggars. We make decisions based on our needs. Persons who refuse to comply with the rules must lose the chances of ratification in the future. Any person arrested involved in voter fraud should be deported immediately and his or her nationality abolished. The point is: we must create a system that does not stimulate illegal migration and adhere to the rules of law while providing us with a steady stream of migrants from other nations who will strengthen our society. There are no states that run their elections exactly as they are, but citizenship across the country is a condition for voting in the United States elections. Non-citizens, including permanent legal residents, may not vote. According to the State, persons convicted of crimes or mentally disabled persons are also unable to vote. As far as we know, Ben Carson never said \"illegal immigrants caught to vote must be stripped of their nationality,\" as Facebook claims. A person involved in voter fraud should lose his or her nationality and be deported. But there is enough ambiguity in his words that they can be interpreted in multiple ways. It could have meant that naturalized citizens must lose their nationality if they were involved in the falsification of voters, although there were no other circumstances - if they were convicted of a crime in some states and had voted in any case, for example - the issuance of the ballot would not be illegal on their own. It could have meant that Americans committing voter fraud should have lost their nationality, although it was unclear where they would be sent if deported. Because he adopts his idea in a column on illegal immigration, it could have meant what the Facebook article says: undocumented immigrants and those who commit voter fraud should have lost their nationality (although they would not have had citizenship if they were illegal immigrants). The Facebook article assumes that that's what he meant - and it's not clear from his column - and goes another step, and attributes what appears to be an artificial quote to Carson. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.
