Scott Walker responded to a journalist's question about the numbers of the highest opinion polls of the Democratic United Mary Burke among women, minorities and youth. How did he know that? \"Some of these issues are just historical patterns, and they are not unique to me,\" said Walker Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board in October 14, 2014. \"If you look at the Democrats (numbers) you can do -- in the last ten elections or so -- just like that. There is therefore no significant gap in terms of Republicans in the presidential, governorial and senatorial elections in the United States.\" He added: \"For many of this, it is about publishing our message and our story. We don't accept any votes in Wisconsin.\" With many gender issues at the heart of each side &apos; s television advertising, and experts who say that the elections of 4 November 2014 are likely to come to the turnout on each side, we wanted to check the historical record of the so-called gender gap and Republican candidates. Did Walker &apos; s 2014 polls of women and men significantly match the gender gap seen in the previous Wisconsin elections of WDP candidates? For this pre-election analysis, we have moved on to the polls conducted by the voters as they left the voting booth after each election. We studied similar races in the recent history of Wisconsin, as well as polling data in the 2012 and 2014 campaigns in Wisconsin. The definition of the gender gap - the Republicans improve their performance with men more than with women; the Democrats improve their performance with women more than with men - is a feature of contemporary politics. In each party, men and women do not vote differently. However, the Democratic Party has fewer men among its supporters; the Republican Party has fewer women. One way to measure the gender gap is simply to take the difference between how a candidate works with a man and how that candidate does with a woman. In the 2012 call-up race, Walker obtained 59 per cent of male votes and 47 per cent of female votes -- a 12-point gender gap. (Tom Barrett's opponent obtained 40 per cent of male votes and 52 per cent of female votes, also making a difference of 12 points.) This gender gap was 12 points the largest in the US Senate in Wisconsin or in the conservative race, where we have been able to obtain poll data for graduation in recent decades. However, this does not conflict significantly with how Republican candidates in Wisconsin have performed in other major races in the past few years. The historical picture of the gender gap is widening in Wisconsin. In the American Senate race in 1988 against Democratic Herb Cole, the Republic did three worse points with women than men. In his 1992 Senate race against the Democratic Ross Fengold, GOP Sen. Bob Casten made two worse points with women than men. However, these gender gaps increased in the 1990s and 2000s - ranging from medium to high figures. For example, the former Republican Government. Tommy Thompson did four worse points with women than men in 1994 and seven worse points in 1998. The Republican Mark Newman did four worse points with women in his 1998 race against Fengold. The Republican Mark Greene did five worse points with women than men in his race against the democratic government. In 2006, Jim Doyle. The gender gap remained greater in the 2010 elections. Walker did nine worse points among women than men in winning the Governor's race, as did Republican Ron Johnson in winning his race in the United States Senate against Fengold. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. On January 15, 2021, in the United States Senate race against Tammy Baldwin, the Republican Tommy Thompson did 10 points worse with women than with women. Given this natural landscape, it is clear that the 12-point gender gap in the 2012 repatriation race is the largest of all, but it is consistent with the trend towards widening the gender gap. It is not much larger than the other major State-level races in 2010 and 2012. When the focus on presidential voting expanded in Wisconsin, the biggest difference is that the gender gap emerged early in time and did not grow to this extent. Some examples: George Herbert Walker Bush did 10 points worse with women than men in his race in 1988; George W. Bush did 11 points worse with women in 2000 and six points worse in 2004; John McCain did 6 points worse with women in 2008 and Matt Romney did 9 points worse with women than men in 2012. We have described these Republican candidates as doing \"the worst with women,\" but you can describe them as easily as they do \"the best with men,\" because the gender gap is a double-edged sword of the two parties. For the Republicans, this can result from the vulnerability of women, but can also result from the power of men. For Democrats, the opposite is true. In winning the Governor, Walker lost the voters, but not by an overwhelming majority, with 48 per cent of women in 2010 and 47 per cent in 2012. The gender gap in those races was more related to the power of Walker with male voters, with men winning 57 per cent in 2010 and 59 per cent in 2012. What does the gender gap look like in the 2014 Walker-Borke race? To answer, we can move on to regular elections conducted by the Law School of the University of Marquette. We also looked at the gender gaps in these other races in the Marchet ballot: the June 2012 repatriation race between Walker and Barrett; the 2012 Senate race between Baldwin and Thompson; and the 2012 presidential race between Romney and Barack Obama. We have calculated the average gender gap in all ballots per race. Once again, the biggest gender gaps emerged in Walker races, although they were only marginally larger than the other races. In 2012, the repatriation race had the largest gender gap in the four competitions. It should be noted that if the question is not the gap between men and women, but Walker's performance with women in particular, its numbers are in fact better than those of most Republicans in recent years in Wisconsin. In other words, he lost among women, but not many other candidates in his party in this state. The most notable exception is Thompson, who the Governor's ground-based victories have shown great win margins between men and women alike. The victory of Thompson in the 1990s is the only case that we found in recent decades of win-win Republics in Wisconsin in a state-level contest for the Governor, the United States Senate or the President. This year, a final observation on the gender gap. In the Marchet election for the Walker-Burke race, the gender gap fluctuated considerably from polling to polling, raising some eyebrows among political observers. It is not unusual for sub-groups of voters to fluctuate, sometimes because of the random variation from survey to survey. The gender gap shrank considerably in the first Marchet poll in October, but returned in the last Marchet poll held prior to the elections from 23 to 26 October. If you are the average of all Marquette polls this year, the gender gap is alive and well. Of the registered male voters, 52 per cent are women and 42 per cent are women over the nine elections in 2014. :: Burke won 48 per cent of registered women voters and 40 per cent of registered women voters. Our assessment says Walker that the gender gap in his support is \"not unique to me\" and \"there is no big gap in terms of Republicans in the presidential and senatorial elections in the United States\" in recent years. Walker is right when he suggests that the gender gap in his race is not significantly different from that seen for other Republican candidates in other similar races in Wisconsin in recent history. At the same time, according to opinion polls, the 2012 win of Walker was the largest gender gap than any other race for the Governor or the United States Senate in Wisconsin. We assess his claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07043"}
