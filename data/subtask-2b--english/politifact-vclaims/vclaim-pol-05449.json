Gina Raimondo\u2019s more interesting sales pitches involved \"Owen.\"\nA character in various General Electric television ads, Owen is a young man thrilled about the prospect of working as a programmer for the old-line industrial and financial services company looking to become a Silicon-Valley-style data giant. \u00a0\nPage 14 of Rhode Island\u2019s PowerPoint presentation to GE portrays \"Bay State Owen,\" who earns a $109,000 salary, and \"Ocean State Owen,\" who makes $93,000.\nThe governor\u2019s Massachusetts Owen pays $2,300 per month for rent while Rhode Island Owen only pays $1,500.\nThe headline is \"Owen in MA vs. Owen in RI\" and the sub-headline proclaims: \"Advantage: Rhode Island.\"\nInitially, we thought Raimondo was saying Owen does better if he works in Rhode Island. We weren\u2019t the only ones judging from the comments online. \u00a0When we did the math, we concluded it was definitely not financially advantageous for Owen to work in Rhode Island.\nEven after paying $800 more for rent in Massachusetts, the bespectacled software developer still earns $500 more per month, according to numbers in the brochure that Raimondo says she shared with GE.\nSubtracting rent, Owen would make $81,400 per year in Massachusetts versus $75,000 in Rhode Island.\nRaimondo\u2019s claim became a lightning rod for some commenters posting on providencejournal.com. Taking Owen\u2019s side, one commenter on providencejournal.com: \"This page actually shows MA being better than RI.\" That wasn\u2019t the only one.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Raimondo wasn\u2019t making a pitch to prospective employees. She was trying to court Owen\u2019s employer.\nRaimondo\u2019s point was that GE can pay Owen $16,000 less if the company sets up its headquarters in Rhode Island.\nThe \"Rhode Island advantage\" isn\u2019t for Owen. It\u2019s for GE.\nRaimondo\u2019s spokeswoman, Marie Aberger, confirmed this and provided source information for the numbers on salary and rent:\nThe numbers check out. The mean yearly wage for software programmers in Massachusetts is about $109,000 per year and about $93,000 in Rhode Island, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rent data came from Zillow.\nOur ruling\nThere are lots of factors, beyond salaries and rental costs, that govern which state is best for GE or best for Owen.\nBut when looking only at Owen\u2019s prospective salary and rental costs, it\u2019s clear Rhode Island is more advantageous for GE, which was the target of Raimondo\u2019s presentation. The ruling is True.\nThe question that can\u2019t be answered, of course, is how much Owen might value living in Boston\u2019s Seaport district as opposed to, say, Providence\u2019s West End.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05449"}
