Because of an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world.\"\nPolitiFact wanted to know if Obama\u2019s claim gives us an accurate picture of U.S. oil numbers.\nA spokesman offered up this White House blog post that touches on Obama\u2019s point in more detail. Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995.\nWe also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their\u00a0November 2013 report, the United States\u00a0produced\u00a0an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and\u00a0imported\u00a07.5 million barrels of oil per day.\nSo Obama\u2019s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point?\nKenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports.\n\"Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,\"Medlock said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It\u2019s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there\u2019s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn\u2019t need to import as much oil supply.\nAnother cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University.\nAside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing.\nWe can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines.\nBut we can\u2019t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades.\nStill, it\u2019s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country\u2019s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration\u2019s fuel efficiency standards.\nOur ruling\nObama said the United States is producing more oil domestically than it\u2019s importing from the rest of the world for the first time in nearly two decades. That claim is on the money. However, a lot of this has been in the works for awhile, including dynamics that pre-date the Obama administration. Experts told us the new dynamic is due to factors like the recession, increased fuel efficiency and ramped up domestic oil production. As a simple statement on where we stand on oil exports vs. imports, though, Obama\u2019s claim is accurate. We rate it True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08388"}
