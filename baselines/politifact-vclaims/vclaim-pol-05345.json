Joe Heck says 'no evidence' Guantanamo used as terrorist 'recruiting tool'", "text": "It\u2019s not entirely clear whether terrorists really care about the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center.\nDespite President Barack Obama\u2019s new plan to close the facility, Republicans are promising to block the move under the rationale that none of the 91 detainees should be moved to the United States.\nBut Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, a U.S. Senate candidate, went further than most and said terrorist groups don\u2019t use Guantanamo at all in recruitment efforts.\n\"There is no evidence to support the claim that Guantanamo is used as a recruiting tool or affecting relations with allies, both of which are being used to advance the president\u2019s flawed foreign policy goals,\" Heck said in a statement.\nHeck saying there\u2019s \"no evidence\" that terrorist groups use the site as a \"recruiting tool\" directly contradicts one of the president\u2019s core arguments for closing the detention center, which made us wonder \u2014 do groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda use Guantanamo in any fashion to draw in potential terrorists?\nTerrorist groups often mention Guantanamo in their propaganda and publications, but it\u2019s less clear whether or not the site is used as a \"recruiting tool\" for potential jihadists.\nU.S. defense officials believe it\u2019s \"no coincidence\" that ISIS forced hostages featured in brutal execution videos wear orange jumpsuits, which defense official Brian McKeon says is \"believed by many to be the symbol of the Guantanamo detention facility.\"\nAnd U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, who was murdered by ISIS in September 2014, mentioned Obama\u2019s failure to close the site in seemingly prepared remarks in his execution video.\nGuantanamo mentions aren\u2019t limited to video. Al-Qaeda\u2019s English-language magazine \"Inspire\" contains a handful of references to the detention center, according to Foundation for the Defense of Democracies senior fellow Thomas Joscelyn.\nBut Joscelyn said Guantanamo tends to be referenced only in passing, like in a 2010 article by Osama bin Laden that\u2019s mostly critical of climate change and capitalism.\n\"I'm finding, once again, that it is infrequently mentioned (especially when compared to other themes) and the regular recruiting messages I've catalogued have nothing to do with Guantanamo,\" he said in an email.\nResearchers question the importance that terrorist groups like ISIS place on Guantanamo, especially since the facility stopped taking in new detainees in 2008. Rather, the site tends to be lumped in with prisoner torture controversies at the Abu Ghraib and Bagram detention centers, which fades in prominence given new issues and a complex, evolving situation in the Middle East.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrookings Institution researchers reviewed English-language publications from al-Qaeda affiliates and ISIS and found that terrorist groups mention the detention center much less frequently than in the throes of the Iraq War, and call Guantanamo at most a \"supporting argument\" to an overarching narrative.\n\"And, while Guantanamo at times provides another instance of this crusade or serves as a counterpoint to U.S. claims of benevolence, the narrative of jihadi propaganda operates at a level far higher than that of any single facility in Cuba,\" the authors wrote in a post on the Lawfare blog.\nAuthor and nonresident Brookings fellow J.M. Berger said that things like expanded use of drones loom much larger than continuing operations at Guantanamo.\n\"U.S. counterterrorism action, particularly drone strikes, are arguably much more important to recruitment and definitely more important to propaganda, but no one talks about shutting those down,\" he said in an email.\nA 2010 United States Institute of Peace report found that young men who are drawn to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda join more because it \"removes the doubt that young men feel about their place in the world, replacing it with purpose and direction.\"\nBerger said recruiters can use Guantanamo as a \"wedge issue\" to further radicalize potential members, but there\u2019s no hard evidence that it\u2019s used as a primary recruiting tool.\nJoscelyn, who tracks mentions of Guantanamo in English-language al-Qaeda publications, says there\u2019s a key difference between references and recruitment of future terrorists.\n\"It is possible that some jihadist somewhere was influenced in some way by Guantanamo,\" he said in an email. \"But the people who are arguing that it is being used as a recruiting tool, mainly President Obama and his administration, have not provided any evidence that it is explicitly being used as a recruiting tool (as opposed to passing mentions in propaganda).\"\nAgain, time dilutes the potency of Guantanamo as a rallying cry against American foreign policy, especially given Obama\u2019s opposition to the site over the past seven years.\n\"It\u2019s not that great of an anti-U.S. message when our own president campaigned on closing it down,\" Northeastern University\u00a0political science professor Max Abrahms said.\nOur ruling\nHeck said that there\u2019s \"no evidence\" that terrorists use Guantanamo as a \"recruiting tool.\"\nTerrorist groups routinely mention the detention site in both written and videotaped propaganda, but the argument is much murkier when it comes to the site\u2019s effectiveness as a \"recruiting tool.\" However, Heck saying blankly that there\u2019s \"no evidence\" the site is used by terrorist groups isn\u2019t entirely accurate.\nWe rate the claim as Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05345"}
