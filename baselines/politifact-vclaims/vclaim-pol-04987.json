We were able to verify that statistic here; officially, the number is 1.3 million annually, or just over 3,000 per day.\nBiden\u2019s office has changed the text in the Medium article to \"more than 1,600\" during the course of our reporting.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also inserted the following correction: \"*The initial number provided for daily cancer deaths in the United States was 3,000\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is roughly the number of daily cancer deaths across the broader Americas.\"\nOur ruling\nBiden said in his Vatican speech that \"in the United States alone we lose more than 3,000 people a day to cancer.\"\nActually, that\u2019s the number of deaths for the Americas as a whole, not for just the United States. After we contacted Biden\u2019s office, they changed the number listed in the Medium article to the correct number, \"more than 1,600.\"\nWhile we laud speedy corrections, it is PolitiFact\u2019s policy to rate statements on the Truth-O-Meter in their initial version, which, in this case, could not be corrected in its original setting, a high-profile international speech. So we rate the original statement False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d5a0bb04-e9b1-4dfc-98fe-c20e3a7a685e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04987"}
