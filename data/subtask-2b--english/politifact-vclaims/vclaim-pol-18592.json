She lost in the primary election on March 3.\nLorraine\u2019s tweet has been shared thousands of times on Twitter and Facebook, where some posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Former Vice President Joe Biden and his runningmate, Sen. Kamala Harris, tested negative.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Lorraine\u2019s claim is wrong.\u00a0\nDemocratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have not contracted the coronavirus. But the same could also be said for Republican leaders. Meanwhile,\u00a0several Democratic mayors and governors have contracted the virus, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.\nNPR has been keeping tabs on\u00a0specific members of Congress who have tested positive for the coronavirus or quarantined after being exposed to it. According to the list, three Republican senators and nine representatives have tested positive or were presumed to have the coronavirus since the pandemic began. That\u2019s more than\u00a0the Democrats, who have had no senators\u00a0 and six\u00a0representatives test positive for the virus.\nPolls suggest that Republicans are less likely than Democrats to view the coronavirus as a serious public health threat. Republican representatives have also been less inclined to wear face masks during meetings and hearings, and more likely to hold in-person rallies and events. Both go against what public health authorities have recommended for slowing the spread of the coronavirus.\nWe reached out to Lorraine for more evidence or a comment. We haven\u2019t heard back.\nShe's wrong that no prominent Democrats have contracted the coronavirus. We rate her post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18592"}
