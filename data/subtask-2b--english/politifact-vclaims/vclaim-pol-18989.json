Under Wisconsin law, that could mean nonconsensual sexual intercourse or other sexual contact, such as ejaculation or urination.\u00a0\nBut sex with a minor isn\u2019t one of the offenses included in that charge.\nAccording to a criminal complaint, a woman Blake knew told police he came to her house and sexually assaulted her before taking a debit card and her car keys and fleeing in her vehicle. The case hasn\u2019t gone to trial.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the allegation that Blake sexually assaulted a child has spread online.
