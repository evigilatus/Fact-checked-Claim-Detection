(The image is a screenshot from a Saturday Night Live skit.) \u00a0In headline type were the words, \"McDonald\u2019s workers in Denmark have a union. Earn $45,000/year.\"\nThe text in the post itself was a bit more detailed. It said, \"McDonald's employees in Denmark have a union, are paid $21/hour ($45,000/year), and enjoy 5 weeks paid vacation.\"\nThe post included a link to an opinion piece for Reuters from a Danish McDonald\u2019s worker, Louise Marie Rantzau.\n\"I work for McDonald\u2019s and I make $21 an hour,\" Rantzau wrote. \"An agreement between our union and the company guarantees that workers older than 18 are paid at least $21 an hour. Employees younger than 18 make at least $15.\"\nWe wanted to check whether Danish McDonald\u2019s workers are unionized and really make $45,000 a year.\nWe found the union contract so that part is simple. As for the $45,000 a year, there are issues but if the number isn\u2019t spot on, it\u2019s pretty close.\nA 2012 annual report from McDonald\u2019s Denmark gives some overall figures. (We used Google Translate to understand the key sections.) Nearly 4,000 Danes work under the Golden Arches, almost all, about 3,500, are hourly employees, and very few are full-time.\nIn its report, the company bundled those part-time hours and converted them into full-time equivalents. In 2011, it paid wages of 530 million Danish kroner to what would be equal to 2,040 full-time workers. That\u2019s different from talking about what the typical worker actually got. Still, when you do the math, the company paid the mathematically average full-time worker about $46,700 that year.\nStatistics Denmark is the government agency that tracks labor information. For the category of food service counter attendants, the annual pay in 2012 was over $41,000. That is for all companies, not just McDonald\u2019s. On an hourly basis, that translates to about $20 an hour.\nThis lines up with a survey run by two economists, Orley Ashenfelter at Princeton University and Stepan Jurajda at CERGE-EI, an economic research center in Prague. Since 1998, they have tracked hourly wages of McDonald\u2019s workers worldwide. (They use the price of a Big Mac as a way to compare worker pay to the cost of living, as in, how many Big Macs does a person get paid an hour.)\nJurajda told PunditFact that their most recent survey found Danish McDonald\u2019s workers make about $20 an hour.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe catch here is that those hourly wages only deliver an annual income of $41,000 or more if a person works full-time, and we know that most people are part-timers. We asked the McDonald\u2019s corporation, both in Denmark and America, for the median yearly earnings. A company spokesman sent us the statement, \"Our hourly rates of pay depend on the role the employee is doing and their age\" \nLars Esbjerg, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark, studies low-wage jobs in his country. Esbjerg said the median earnings are not publicly available, but he sent us a copy of the latest McDonald\u2019s union contract. The lowest hourly rate is 115 DKK, or $20.70. Anyone who works after 6 p.m. or on Sundays is paid more.\n\"Given that many will work odd hours, the full-time equivalent wage of $45,000 sounds about right to me,\" Esbjerg said.\nTrimming the pay advantage\nTypically, when the pay scale at McDonald\u2019s in Europe comes up, the most common rebuttal is that people there pay higher taxes. That\u2019s accurate, but while wages are more than double what they are in the United States, taxes are not.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American fast food worker makes about $9 an hour. Compare that to the $20.70 paid in Denmark. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average tax burden in Denmark is 38.2 percent, while in America, it is 31.3 percent. So taxes are about a fifth higher. Most people, if given the choice, would accept a 20 percent hike in taxes in exchange for making twice as much.\nThat still doesn\u2019t quite make it an apples-to-apples comparison because the cost of living is higher in Denmark. Both Jurajda and Esbjerg said that this also cuts into the wage advantage that Danish McDonald\u2019s workers enjoy over their American counterparts.\nBut at the end of the day, according to Princeton economist Orley Ashenfelter, they still come out ahead.\n\"I'm sure that the Danish McWorkers are pretty happy,\" Ashenfelter said.\nAshenfelter added that as a fraction of the workforce, Denmark has far fewer McDonald\u2019s employees than does the United States. He also said that for many decades, the Danes have used wages as part of a conscious policy to reduce inequality.\nOur ruling\nThe group The Other 98% said that Danish McDonald\u2019s workers have a union and make $45,000 a year. The union membership is totally accurate. The matter of pay is true for some workers, but certainly the majority work too few hours to make that much. Still, the average numbers provided by McDonald\u2019s Denmark, government statistics, and data analyzed by economists who have studied the earnings of Danish McDonald\u2019s workers, generally support that figure. The post did not specifically say that all McDonald\u2019s workers made $45,000 a year, and the broader point, that it is much better to flip burgers in Copenhagen than in Cleveland, holds up.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\nUpdate: The McDonald's Corporation sent a statement after this check was published", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07353"}
