This is one of the allegations of the opening of the eye in the announcement of the recent television attack by a group supporting Marshall Tuck, the Thurmond opponent in the race. The two Democrats are running for the post of State Comptroller of Public Education. Thormond is a member of the State Council representing Richmond, Berkeley and other communities in the Eastern Gulf and is supported by the Teachers' Union. Tak is a former Executive Director of Education supported by rented school groups. The incumbent, Tom Turlacson, will be named in January after serving two four-year terms. The candidates and their support groups have produced a surge of negative advertising in recent weeks after tens of millions of dollars have been raised. We wanted to know if there was any evidence to support the claim that Thormond \"wanted\" by Obama's administration. Before becoming a state law maker, Thormond served on the Board of the West Contra Costa Unified School, based in Richmond, from 2008 to 2012. The announcement of the television attack refers to the official blame given by the Obama administration to the district supervisor. This is the full version of the announcement of the attack: \"Before running for the post of Director of State, politician Tony Thurmond was responsible for a school district with wide-ranging budgetary problems. He was last ranked in the state because of his failure to serve colored students. He used to leave at-risk students in rotten trailers with mushrooms growing in the floor. The Obama Administration reprimanded for not addressing sexual harassment and abuse on a large scale in provincial schools. Tony Thormond failed the students he was supposed to help. California deserves better.\" Marshall Tuck supports Beck's announcement targeting Tony Thormond in 2018 from Edsors in Fimo. The announcement was made by the students, parents and teachers supporting Marshall Tak, an independent spending group established by Ed Voto, a non-profit organization supporting rented schools. During the voting, the Declaration uses misleading language to blur the distinction between actions taken specifically against the school area and Thurmond. The text reads: \"Tony THORMOND: scolding by the Obama administration.\" We looked at the analysis by Edsors, a non-profit news organization covering education, about this claim: the distinguished fact-checking bloggers stated on January 28, 2021 in Facebook that they tried to \"close\" the California government's calling campaign. \u2219 (Gavin Newsom) By Chris Nichols \u2022 2 February 2021 \"The allegation that Thrummond was reprimanded by the Obama administration is false. The letter from the Civil Rights Bureau of the Obama Ministry of Education criticizing the handling of sexual harassment by the united West Country Costa never mentions Thurmond or the Provincial Board. The letter was issued in 2013, after Thurmond left the Council, although it mentions the investigation initiated by the Ministry during his term of office in 2010. &quot; The letter was sent to the supervisor of the school area. \"Obama never scolded me,\" told Thurmond Edsors, who also reported Thormond's campaign to send a stop and stop order to the committee that produced it. Ed Voto's spokesman referred to a website created by the independent spending group that supports Tuck. It repeats the same allegations in the television announcement and contains a link to the Obama Message. However, it does not provide any information directly linking Thrummond to the reprimand. When we asked Thormond about his campaign, she referred to groups and individuals from the National Alliance for the Congolese People to the United States, Sun Kamala Harris, and the Mayor of San Francisco London Post, who all called for the announcement. In verifying the relevant facts, we assessed Thormond's error was \"issued\" by ACLU to leave students in unsafe conditions. Our verdict on the announcement of the recent television attack by a group supporting Marshall Tuck claimed that the Obama administration \"recovered\" Tony Thormond for problems of sexual abuse and harassment when he served on the school district board. The Ministry of Education of Obama denounced the united West Contra Costa dealing with sexual harassment during a period of service to Thurmond on the Provincial Board. However, the report never mentioned Thrummond, but was directed to the district supervisor. The district school principals, who are not members of the boards of directors, are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the district. The text of the TV ad distorts the facts by misdirecting Thormond. We evaluated the claim for error. - The statement is not accurate.
