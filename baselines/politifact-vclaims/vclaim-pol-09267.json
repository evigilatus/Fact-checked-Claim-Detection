Tate also unpacked some specific claims about urban areas, specifically Milwaukee.\n\n\"You know, I think that it\u2019s a problem that a bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple,\" he said. \"You go around some neighborhoods in Milwaukee and, good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option.\"\n\nMilwaukee Common Council President Willie Hines Jr. made a similar statement in a recent opinion piece in the Journal Sentinel, saying that \"it\u2019s generally a lot easier to reach for the less expensive Cheetos, doughnuts and Suzy Q\u2019s than the more pricey veggie chips, granola bars and almonds.\"\n\nIs Tate right?\n\nTo check out the two parts of Tate\u2019s claim, we reached out to local food experts, but also fueled up a car to test the food market in some of Milwaukee\u2019s poorest north-side neighborhoods.\n\nIn all we made purchases at 11 stores, ranging from full-line groceries to corner convenience stores and gas-station marts, mostly in Milwaukee but a few in neighboring suburban communities.\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at us: At 2-for-$1, a single serving bag of Cheetos Crunchy (170 calories, 18 percent of recommended daily fat allowance) is hard to beat on price for a snack. In fact, many stores offer a whole range of chips at 50 cents a bag.\n\nBy comparison, when we sought out single apples at the lowest per-pound or individual price available, we paid less than half a buck only once.\n\nAt the top end, we paid $1.21 and $1.20 for an apple at two full-size markets and 65 cents and 99 cents at two convenience stores. Still, we were able to beat or match the Cheetos price, finding apples for 37 cents at a major Milwaukee supermarket, and for 50 cents at two city convenience stores as well as a supermarket in bordering Wauwatosa. Not every store had apples and not every store had single apples.\n\nThat was just for snack-sized purchases. Bulk packaging, of course, drops the cost.\n\nWe found 5-packs of gala apples (estimated 79 calories each, 0 from fat) at a small grocery in Milwaukee for the equivalent of 40 cents a piece, give or take a penny. And a chain supermarket near the edge of the city, in Shorewood, had bags of apples that averaged about 45 cents a piece. A chain store had them for 38 cents apiece in bulk.\n\nBut Cheetos can drop even lower, to as little as 24 cents cents a bag, in 50-bag packs in combination with other snack chips, we found at one supermarket in Milwaukee.\n\nIt was clear from our limited check that Cheetos are often cheaper than apples -- though not always.\n\nPrices, of course, can vary widely depending on quantity, timing, sales and other factors.\n\nAnd individual appetites can skew comparisons -- a 3.75-ounce bag of Cheetos Crunchy Flamin\u2019 Hot is advertised as four servings but we\u2019re guessing it doesn\u2019t always go down that way. That bag will set you back $1.49 -- or about 37 cents a serving if you can stop \u00a0after 21 pieces.\n\nSeeking fruit\n\nWe sought out expert opinion on the larger issue Tate raised -- on the availability of healthy food options.\n\nSherrie Tussler, executive director of the Hunger Task Force in Milwaukee, told us that many FoodShare recipients rely at least in part on convenience stores because they lack transportation to reach supermarkets that can offer fresher and sometimes less expensive products.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHunger Task Force, which opposes the state legislation as too expensive and complicated, closely tracks food availability in the city and plans to create a corner market emphasizing healthy foods.\n\nResidents in Milwaukee\u2019s lowest socioeconomic-status group have more than twice the saturation of small food outlets as in higher-status neighborhoods, the Milwaukee Health Report 2012 study found. The annual report, by the Center for Urban Population Health, examines health disparities by socioeconomic status.\n\n\"There is strong evidence that access to supermarkets rather than smaller grocery/convenience stores correlates with lower prevalence of overweight, obesity, and hypertension,\" the study said.\n\nThe report said obesity rates in Milwaukee -- which easily top the Wisconsin average -- are highest in lower-economic status populations. The Health Report study found that inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables is prevalent across all economic groups, but somewhat better at higher levels.\n\n\"A lot of it is because you can afford it and you can find it,\" said Geoffrey Swain, medical director for the Milwaukee Health Department and a co-author of the Health Report study.\n\nA close observer of convenience stores in town commented recently that corner convenience stores are the main food source for Milwaukee\u2019s poor.\n\n\"Some stores do have fruits and vegetables, but are likely to be more expensive and of poorer quality, mainly because our nation\u2019s produce distribution system is not geared to service the small mom-and-pop corner stores,\" Young Kim, executive director of the organization behind the north-side\u2019s Fondy Farmers Market, wrote in May 14 column for Urban Milwaukee. Tate points to Kim\u2019s piece as part of his argument on the difficulty in getting access to fresh fruit.\n\nKim told us that fruit \"just isn\u2019t nearly as readily available\" as some of the snack foods. \"Cheetos and a lot of those snack foods get delivered\" to small stores, in contrast to fruit, which small-store owners have to buy from larger stores and then mark up, he noted. Kim opposes the state legislation for singling out low-income people.\n\nIn our spot check at five small stores, we, too, found that you can get some limited amounts of fruit at some corner stores -- as well as, of course, a full selection at the few larger food markets on Milwaukee\u2019s north side.\n\nAnd we found that fruit quality was very mixed at the small stores, ranging from excellent to very poor.\n\nWe learned that programs run by the Fondy Food Center and the Walnut Way Conservation Corp., among others, are working to try to put more fresh goods into local stores and educate people on healthy choices.\n\nThe city of Milwaukee Health Department, through grant funding from the Healthier Wisconsin Partnership Program of the Medical College of Wisconsin, has provided funds for produce coolers in several convenience stores in the Lindsay Heights neighborhood on Milwaukee\u2019s north side. At one store, Eagle Foods at N. 14th and W. Centers streets, we found fruit in a large and prominent display near a cooler stocked with take-out servings of cut fruit and vegetables, as well as mangoes and tomatoes.\n\nAt the Families First store, 1845 N. 12th St., candy bars are behind a caged cashier, and a small stock of large Golden Delicious apples are front and center. There were a few tomatoes in the cooler, but overall the produce stock was very limited.\n\nNobody\u2019s suggesting that better access is a panacea for changing people\u2019s dietary decisions. Consumer education is another key, Hines and other say. But experts told us that providing more choices is a necessary first step toward improvement.\n\nBut there\u2019s a steep hill to climb in terms of making good quality produce widely available.\n\nA 2008 study by the Neighborhood Health Alliance in Lindsay Heights, for example, found that more than 65% of the neighborhood retail food outlets offered no fresh produce. \"Residents indicated that key concerns were: poor food quality, poor access to quality fresh produce and healthy food options, and a lack of transportation,\" the study found.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to call it a \u2018food desert,\u2019\" Eric Gass, the Health Department\u2019s public health research and policy director, said of Lindsay Heights. \"Food is available. It\u2019s just not good food. There\u2019s a term I\u2019ve heard for that: a \u2018food swamp.\u2019\"\n\nResidents in the Amani neighborhood, near Lindsay Heights, who lack vehicles or can\u2019t get a ride have to figure out how to cover a mile and a half or more to find a full-service store on the city\u2019s north side, Tussler said. Buses are an option.\n\n\"Think bus fare,\" Tussler said in an email to us. \"Then how much can you carry? Then think once a month you pay for a taxi. You buy case goods because they don't spoil. You freeze meat and buy Wonder Bread because it doesn't mold. Then you get milk at the corner store.\"\n\nWhile access to good quality, healthier foods has improved only marginally on the north side in recent years, Tussler said, \"the south side has been a big winner.\" She noted the expansion by local El Rey markets and the addition of large stores such as the Pick \u2018N Save at S. 19th St. and W. National Ave.\n\nOverall, on this part of Tate\u2019s claim, we heard -- and saw for ourselves -- that fruit is for sale on the north side, but not necessarily in the kind of quantities that make it as affordable or as fresh as in some other neighborhoods. And getting to the store that has what a family needs can be a challenge for some.\n\nThe legislation, meanwhile, was pending in the state Senate as of late May 2013. The city of Milwaukee took no position on the bill.\n\nOur rating\n\nTate, the Democratic Party official, decried the lack of healthy and affordable food options in some Milwaukee neighborhoods. \"A bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple,\" Tate said, and \"good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option\" at stores there.\n\nHe\u2019s mostly right on the price comparison, and is partially accurate in suggesting it\u2019s very difficult to locate fresh fruit. While fresh fruit can be found at big and some small stores, it\u2019s more available in some low-income areas more than others, and getting there, finding it worth eating and paying for it are a challenge for some, according to experts and residents.\n\nWe rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09267"}
