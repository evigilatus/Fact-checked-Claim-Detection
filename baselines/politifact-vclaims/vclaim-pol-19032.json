(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe reached out to the Trump and Biden campaigns, as well as the office of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., but none immediately responded.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s office pointed us to the the Massachussetts Democrat\u2019s tax returns posted on her website. Many of the 2020 presidential candidates released their tax returns on the campaign trail, posting them online for voters to review.\u00a0\n\"By allowing the public to see their taxes, the Democratic candidates are creating a contrast with President Donald Trump, who defied tradition by refusing to disclose his taxes when he ran for president in 2016,\" the New York Times reported in 2019.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what we know.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Biden\u2019s 2017 tax return, he had made payments toward his federal income tax totaling $3,742,974. That\u2019s the number that appears in the Facebook post. But the return says he still owed $1,666, so in all, he was on the hook for a little bit more: $3,744,640.\nAccording to Harris\u2019 2017 tax return \u2014\u00a0page 280 of 528 in this PDF of her 2004-18 tax returns that her campaign released\u2014\u00a0 her total federal tax was $516,469, the number that appears in the Facebook post. Including an estimated tax penalty of $2,608, she owed about $519,000 that year.\u00a0\nAccording to Sanders\u2019 2017 tax return, he owed $343,882.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to Warren\u2019s 2017 tax return, the total federal income tax she owed was $268,484.\nThe Facebook post gets Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s federal tax debts correct, and it\u2019s very close on how much Biden and Harris owed in 2017. It also says that Trump paid $750 in federal taxes that year, which the New York Times recently reported.\u00a0\nWe haven\u2019t seen Trump\u2019s income tax returns \u2014 he\u2019s the only president in modern times to withhold them from the public. A lawyer for the Trump Organization told the New York Times that \"most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate\" in response to a letter the newspaper sent summarizing its findings.\u00a0\n\"Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,\" the lawyer told the paper in a statement.\nThe New York Times noted that this claim appeared to conflate income tax with other federal taxes Trump has paid, including Social Security and Medicare.\nIf evidence emerges to bear that out the claims of Trump\u2019s lawyer, we will reconsider our rating on this fact-check.\u00a0\nFor now, we rate this post Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19032"}
