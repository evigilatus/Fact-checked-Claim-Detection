Or a third whale. At least, a recent article on Facebook is equal to the two. \"The Hunting of the Third Whales,\" says the August 19 article, which shows an example of mating whales apparently and a third underneath them. \"So apparently when two big whales do bad there sometimes this one brother who's just kind of holding them up doesn't float off. \"Nature is beautiful.\" This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Nature is beautiful, but what happens here is a little love, more war. \"Good story!\" Scott Krauss, chief marine mammalian at the Anderson-Kabot Center for Ocean Life, said about the Facebook article. \"But totally fantasy. Why would one male help another to secure sex? It doesn't make any biological sense to abandon the creation of your genetic caller to help your friend.\" Many remarks from the mating groups on the right, the head of the bow and the gray whales led people to believe men help each other to get the female, as Krauss said. \"But it's mostly competition, pure and simple.\" From the book \"Gray whales\" by David J. Gordon and Alan Baldridge, Q&A of The New York Times says that \"Thorin flirts often following the same cow, The idea that any additional male mated whales to stabilize them was often rejected as a misinterpretation of what was going on in a difficult process to study, according to the Times. The different species of whales behave differently. The competitions between male humpback whales may be violent, or fatal, according to the 2008 Smithsonian magazine story, where male whales attack each other underwater competing for female interest. In August 2000, scientists at the same time observed the presence of a right-wing whale of North American women who had sex with both males. Krauss told us that when female whales with their jet vents remain straight and swim forward, they may ensure that only males fit enough to keep up and hold their breath for long periods of time can mate with them. In the right whales, he said, \"The more likely the female is to incite this behavior through advocacy -- the greater the male population, the greater the competition, the more likely she is to have the best male.\" A video from 2015 published by National Geographic on YouTube shows the gray whales, which says, \"You may be involved in three ways.\" \"On January 10, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers mentioned the story of \"Trap the signs of the rebellion law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman: 11 January 2021 \"It's common to see two gray male whales bend to a female,\" the text that appears on the video reads. \"They rotate to try to mate with her.\" The adaptation of the body is important in these 35-foot mammals as well as mammals. One male supports the female while the other tries to mate with her.\" An accompanying article quoted by a grey whale researcher says: \"Many gray whales mate the trinity, and sometimes one male supports the other until they mate and then reverse their positions.\" This data seems to support Facebook flyers, but we wanted to know more. We contacted Mark Gerardo, a wildlife photographer who used a drone to record whale footage published by National Geographic. He told us that the information in The New York Times that challenges the idea of a third-hand whale is accurate. \"Many species have not even been documented as mating, so we just don't know,\" he said. \"It was previously thought that the grey whales had only mated in threes for support, but I also recently discovered that they were just two male rivals, and that it was just a matter of which minutiae the bull was doing the job.\" We asked Trevor Branch, a professor at the Washington University School of Water Sciences and Fisheries, about the demands of \"third whale fishing.\" \"It seems very unlikely\" told us in an e-mail. \"There are often two males competing for mating with the female, and it may seem (as if one of them was under (f) supporting the married couple.\" He referred to a recent article in marine mammalian science that he noticed was \"on this exact scenario in blue whales.\" The article states that companion behavior, in which a male is accompanied by a female, is known to occur among animals including humpback whales, African elephants and some major species of animals. The article states: \"The law allows males to defend females, thereby limiting the access of other males to females, thereby increasing the likelihood of potential offspring.\" The male villagers may challenge the male escorts to replace him. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, it is often observed that when a blue whale joins a third whale, usually a male trinity starts with traffic, racing high from water, including strong surface shows that cause explosive spraying and arc waves. This behaviour either ends with the intruder man leaving the husband or the main facilities are replaced by the intruder male.\" Rob Williams, chief scientist of the Oceans Initiative, told us that in the 1980s, there was a theory of three-way mating, including \"helpers\" among the gray whales. \"But I think even the authors noticed that this was our guess,\" said Williams. \"I am not aware of any genetic evidence that over the past 30 years these third whales have actually been helpful.\" Philip Klapham, former programme leader of the Cetacean Assessment and Ecology Programme and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), was clearer when we asked him about the Facebook article. \"The idea that one male holds a pair of mates is complete and releases the bulls--,\" he said. In some whale species, many males compete for the same female, \"tell us. The gray whales are more calm than humpback whales, for example, but those underwater abdomen are competitive, not cooperative.
