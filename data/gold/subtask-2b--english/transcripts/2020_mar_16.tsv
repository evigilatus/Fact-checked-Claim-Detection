1	Jake Tapper	Welcome to this unique event, the CNN Univision Democratic Presidential Debate with the two leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, candidates.
2	Jake Tapper	Welcome.
3	Jake Tapper	It’s good to have you.
4	Jake Tapper	I’m Jake Tapper, along with CNN’s Dana Bash, and Univision’s Ilia Calderón.
5	Dana Bash	We come together tonight at an extraordinary time in our country when people are worried about far more than just presidential politics.
6	Dana Bash	We’re in a national emergency because of the devastating global pandemic of coronavirus.
7	Dana Bash	It has killed nearly 6,000 [inaudible 00:00:34] and more than 3,300 known cases here in the United States.
8	Dana Bash	As a result, tonight’s debate will focus heavily on the crisis.
9	Ilia Calderón	The setting of this debate is also different.
10	Ilia Calderón	To reduce unnecessary risk of transmission of the virus, CNN, Univision, the Democratic National Committee, and the campaigns moved this debate from Phoenix, Arizona to here at CNN studios in Washington without any audience.
11	Jake Tapper	All of this comes of course as four more states, Florida, Arizona, Ohio, and Illinois prepare to vote on Tuesday, with Vice President Biden currently leading Senator Sanders in the race for delegates.
12	Jake Tapper	Here’s what we’re going to do tonight.
13	Jake Tapper	Each of you will have 90 seconds to answer questions, and 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals.
14	Jake Tapper	As much as we can, we hope this will be a conversation between the two of you, so let’s begin with the most important issue right now, the coronavirus, and what you would do as president in the face of it.
15	Jake Tapper	Vice President Biden, let me start with you.
16	Jake Tapper	We’re in a reality right now that might’ve seemed unimaginable a week ago.
17	Jake Tapper	Schools have been canceled for more than 25 million students.
18	Jake Tapper	Grocery store shelves have been cleared out.
19	Jake Tapper	March Madness, NBA games, Disney parks, Broadway, small businesses, all shut down, and just today the CDC issued a new recommendation that for the next eight weeks, events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the US be canceled or postponed.
20	Jake Tapper	What do you say to the American people who are confronting this new reality?
21	Joe Biden	First of all, my heart goes out to those who have already lost someone, or those who are suffering from the virus, and this is bigger than any one of us.
22	Joe Biden	This calls for a national rallying to everybody move together, and I laid out in detail what I would do were I president today.
23	Joe Biden	You can go to joebiden.com.
24	Joe Biden	I laid it out in significant detail, but there are three pieces of this.
25	Joe Biden	First of all, have to take care of those who in fact are exposed, or are likely to be exposed to the virus, and that means we have to do testing.
26	Joe Biden	We have to get the testing kits up and ready.
27	Joe Biden	I would have the World Health Organization, I’d take advantage of the test kits they have available to us, even though the president says a million or more are coming, let’s just get all the tests we can done as quickly as we can.
28	Joe Biden	Secondly, I would make sure that every state in the union had at least 10 places where they had drive-through testing arrangements.
29	Joe Biden	I would also at this point deal with the need to begin to plan for the need for additional hospital beds.
30	Joe Biden	We have that capacity in the Department of Defense as well as with the FEMA, and they can set up hundred-bed, 500-bed hospitals and tents quickly.
31	Joe Biden	We have to lay all that out, but we have to deal with the economic fallout quickly, and that means making sure that people who in fact lose their job, don’t get a paycheck, can’t pay their mortgage, are able to pay it, and pay them now, and do it now.
32	Joe Biden	Small businesses be able to borrow interest-free loans.
33	Joe Biden	I see my time is up here.
34	Joe Biden	You’re going to hold us tightly, I assume, but that’s what I would do.
35	Joe Biden	Go to joebiden.com.
36	Joe Biden	It lays out precisely what I would do were I president today.
37	Jake Tapper	Senator Sanders, this morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci acknowledged that it’s possible that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans, could die of coronavirus in a worst-case scenario.
38	Jake Tapper	If you were president right now, what’s the most important thing you would do tonight to try to save American lives?
39	Bernie Sanders	Well, first thing we have got to do, whether or not I’m president, is to shut this president up right now, because he is undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people.
40	Bernie Sanders	It is unacceptable for him to be blabbering with unfactual information which is confusing the general public.
41	Bernie Sanders	Second of all, what we need to do, and I’m glad that he has called a state of national emergency.
42	Bernie Sanders	What we have got to do is move aggressively to make sure that every person in this country finally understands that when they get sick with the coronavirus that all payments will be made, that they don’t have to worry about coming up with money for testing.
43	Bernie Sanders	They don’t have to worry about coming up with money for treatment.
44	Bernie Sanders	This is an unprecedented moment in American history.
45	Bernie Sanders	Now, I obviously believe in Medicare for all.
46	Bernie Sanders	I will fight for that as president, but right now in this emergency, I want every person in this country to understand that when you get sick, you go to the doctor.
47	Bernie Sanders	When you get sick, if you have the virus, that will be paid for.
48	Bernie Sanders	Do not worry about the cost right now, because we’re in the middle of a national emergency.
49	Bernie Sanders	Second of all, we have to make sure that our hospitals have the ventilators that they need, have the IC units that they need.
50	Bernie Sanders	Right now, we have a lack of medical personnel, and I worry very much that if there is a peak, whether we have the capability of dealing with the hundreds of thousands of people who may be in hospitals, so we need unprecedented action right now to deal with the unprecedented crisis.
51	Bernie Sanders	Bottom line from an economic point of view, what we have got to say to the American people, if you lose your job, you will be made whole.
52	Bernie Sanders	You’re not going to lose income.
53	Bernie Sanders	If Trump can put, or the fed can put a trillion and a half into the banking system …
54	Jake Tapper	Thank you, Senator.
55	Bernie Sanders	… we can protect the wages of every worker in America.
56	Jake Tapper	Thank you, Senator.
57	Jake Tapper	Vice President Biden, President Trump says he does not take any responsibility for the problems with coronavirus testing, in part because he says he inherited so many rules, regulations, and red tape.
58	Jake Tapper	Did bureaucratic red tape hamper this response in any way?
59	Joe Biden	No.
60	Joe Biden	Look, the World Health Organization offered, offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now.
61	Joe Biden	We refused them.
62	Joe Biden	We did not want to buy them.
63	Joe Biden	We did not want to get them from them.
64	Joe Biden	We wanted to make sure we had our own.
65	Joe Biden	I think he said something like, “We have the best scientists in America,” or something to that effect.
66	Joe Biden	The idea that we are not prepared for this and not … The other thing I want to point out, and I agree with Bernie, we’re in a situation where we have to now be providing for the hospitals that are going to be needed, needed now.
67	Joe Biden	The present system cannot handle the surge that is likely to come, so we should already be sitting down and planning where we’re going to put these temporary hospitals, and we can do that.
68	Joe Biden	We did that … We’ve been through this before with the coronavirus.
69	Joe Biden	We’ve been through this … I mean, excuse me, we’ve been through this before with dealing with the viruses that the N1H1 as well as what happened in Africa.
70	Joe Biden	We provided these hospitals dealing with these great pandemics, and were able to do it quickly, and people would have a place to go, but we also have to provide the equipment to protect the first responders, and that’s not being done either.
71	Jake Tapper	Senator Sanders, on that note, and both of you have addressed this, but obviously another major health concern right now for officials is the potential surge in patients all at once, overburdening hospitals, the healthcare system.
72	Jake Tapper	You’ve mentioned ICU beds, both of you, and ventilators.
73	Jake Tapper	We’re already in the middle of flu season, so already a lot of those beds and ventilators are already being used.
74	Jake Tapper	If you were president right now, what would you do to make sure every sick American is able to get treatment so the US does not suffer the same fate as Italy, where doctors have to decide right now who gets lifesaving treatment and who does not?
75	Bernie Sanders	Jake, let’s be honest and understand that this coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current healthcare system.
76	Bernie Sanders	Now, we’re spending twice as much per person on healthcare as the people of any other country.
77	Bernie Sanders	How in God’s name does it happen that we end up with 87 million people who are uninsured or underinsured and there are people who are watching this program tonight, and say, “I’m not feeling well.
78	Bernie Sanders	Should I go to the doctor?
79	Bernie Sanders	But I can’t afford to go to the doctor.
80	Bernie Sanders	What happens if I am sick?
81	Bernie Sanders	It’s going to cost thousands of dollars for treatment.
82	Bernie Sanders	Who’s going to feed my kids?” We are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people.
83	Bernie Sanders	We’re spending so much money, and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic.
84	Bernie Sanders	How come we don’t have enough doctors?
85	Bernie Sanders	How come hospitals in rural areas are shutting down?
86	Bernie Sanders	How come people can’t afford to get the prescription drugs they need, because we have a bunch of crooks who are running the pharmaceutical industry, ripping us off every single day, and I’ll tell you something right now, in the midst of this epidemic, you’ve got people in the pharmaceutical industry who are saying, “Oh wow, what an opportunity to make a fortune.” So the word has got to go out.
87	Bernie Sanders	I certainly would do this as president.
88	Bernie Sanders	You don’t worry, people of America, do not worry about the cost of prescription drugs.
89	Bernie Sanders	Do not worry about the cost of the healthcare that you’re going to get, because we are a nation, a civilized democratic society.
90	Bernie Sanders	Everybody, rich and poor, middle-class, will get the care they need.
91	Bernie Sanders	The drug companies will not rip us off.
92	Dana Bash	Thank you, Senator.
93	Dana Bash	Vice President Biden, some medical experts are saying the only true way to control this virus is through a national quarantine, requiring every American other than essential personnel to stay home.
94	Dana Bash	Would you take that unprecedented step of a national lockdown?
95	Joe Biden	What I would do is what we did in our administration.
96	Joe Biden	I would call a meeting in The Situation Room of all the experts in America dealing with this crisis.
97	Joe Biden	I would sit them down, and I would do exactly what we did then.
98	Joe Biden	What is it that we need?
99	Joe Biden	Listen to the experts.
100	Joe Biden	What do we need?
101	Joe Biden	With all due respect to Medicare for all, you have a single-payer system in Italy.
102	Joe Biden	It doesn’t work there.
103	Joe Biden	It has nothing to do with Medicare for all.
104	Joe Biden	That would not solve the problem at all.
105	Joe Biden	We can take care of that right now by making sure that no one has to pay for treatment, period, because of the crisis.
106	Joe Biden	No one has to pay for whatever drugs are needed, period, because of the crisis.
107	Joe Biden	No one has to pay for hospitalization because of the crisis, period.
108	Joe Biden	That is a national emergency, and that’s how it’s handled.
109	Joe Biden	It is not working in Italy right now, and they have a single-payer system.
110	Joe Biden	Now, with regard to what else I would do, the fact is that we’re in a position where I would bring together the leading experts in the world, instead of doing this, in the United States, instead of doing this piecemeal, sit down and do what we did before with the Ebola crisis.
111	Joe Biden	What is needed?
112	Joe Biden	And have one voice, one voice, like we did every day we met on that crisis in The Situation Room, so we lay out overall, for all the nation, what the best proposal is and how to move forward.
113	Joe Biden	In the absence of that, governors are making some sound decisions.
114	Joe Biden	They’re doing the best they can by going out and getting the healthcare experts in their communities and their states to move, but it should be directed from the White House, from The Situation Room, laying out in detail like we did in the Ebola crisis …
115	Dana Bash	Thank you.
116	Joe Biden	… and we beat it.
117	Dana Bash	Thank you.
118	Dana Bash	Senator Sanders, your response?
119	Bernie Sanders	Well, first of all, the dysfunctionality of the current healthcare system is obviously apparent.
120	Bernie Sanders	As I said earlier, there are people who hesitate go to the doctor.
121	Bernie Sanders	You’re going to have the maze of regulations.
122	Bernie Sanders	Well, if this is my income, but that’s my income, can I get it?
123	Bernie Sanders	Can I not get it?
124	Bernie Sanders	Clearly we are not prepared, and Trump only exacerbates the crisis.
125	Bernie Sanders	When we spend twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation, one might expect that we would have enough doctors all over this country.
126	Bernie Sanders	One might expect that we would have affordable prescription drugs.
127	Bernie Sanders	One might expect that we were preparing effectively for a pandemic, that we were ready with the ventilators, with the ICUs, with the test kits that we need.
128	Bernie Sanders	We are not, and bottom line here is in terms of Medicare for all, despite what the vice president is saying, what the experts tell us, is that one of the reasons that we are unprepared and have been unprepared is we don’t have a system.
129	Bernie Sanders	We got thousands of private insurance plans.
130	Bernie Sanders	That is not a system that is prepared to provide healthcare to all people.
131	Bernie Sanders	In a good year without the epidemic, we’re losing up to 60,000 people who die every year because they don’t get to a doctor on time.
132	Bernie Sanders	It’s clearly this crisis is only making a bad situation worse.
133	Joe Biden	That has nothing to do when you’re in a national crisis.
134	Joe Biden	The national crisis says we’re responding.
135	Joe Biden	It’s all free.
136	Joe Biden	You don’t have to pay for a thing.
137	Joe Biden	That has nothing to do with whether or not you have an insurance policy.
138	Joe Biden	This is a crisis.
139	Joe Biden	We’re at war with the virus.
140	Joe Biden	We’re at war with the virus.
141	Joe Biden	It has nothing to do with copays or anything.
142	Joe Biden	We just pass a law saying that you do not have to pay for any of this, period.
143	Bernie Sanders	That’s not true.
144	Bernie Sanders	As a matter of fact, that’s not true.
145	Bernie Sanders	That law has enormous loopholes.
146	Bernie Sanders	I understand that Nancy Pelosi did her best.
147	Bernie Sanders	Republicans prevented it.
148	Bernie Sanders	What you’re-
149	Joe Biden	No, I’m-
150	Bernie Sanders	What you’re talking about, Joe, here, is enormous loopholes within that, that in fact it is not necessarily covering treatment for all people in America, and that people are going to be stuck with a bill unless we change that, and we’re going to offer legislation to in fact change that.
151	Joe Biden	If I may, I offered legislation.
152	Joe Biden	I laid out on my plan that it would cover exactly what is not covered by the house.
153	Joe Biden	I laid out in the plan that I laid out for how we would deal with this crisis.
154	Joe Biden	Nobody, nobody will pay for anything having to do with the crisis.
155	Joe Biden	This is a national emergency.
156	Joe Biden	There isn’t a question of whether or not this is something that could be covered by insurance, or anything else.
157	Joe Biden	We, out of the treasury, are going to pay for this.
158	Joe Biden	It’s a national emergency.
159	Bernie Sanders	But you see …
160	Joe Biden	That’s what my plan calls for.
161	Bernie Sanders	But the weakness of this is, let’s just do a hypothetical.
162	Bernie Sanders	A family member’s diagnosed with the virus.
163	Joe Biden	Yep.
164	Bernie Sanders	Terrible tragedy, massive anxiety.
165	Bernie Sanders	The wife has the virus.
166	Bernie Sanders	The husband is a wreck, wants to go to a psychologist, wants to get counseling, doesn’t have the money to do that.
167	Bernie Sanders	Maybe their kid breaks a leg.
168	Bernie Sanders	They don’t have the money to go to healthcare.
169	Bernie Sanders	So you’re saying right now in the middle of a crisis, but you know what?
170	Bernie Sanders	Last year at least 30,000 people died in America because they didn’t get healthcare when they should, because we don’t have universal coverage.
171	Bernie Sanders	I think that’s a crisis.
172	Bernie Sanders	One out of five people in America cannot afford the prescription drugs they need.
173	Bernie Sanders	They suffer.
174	Bernie Sanders	Some die.
175	Bernie Sanders	I consider that a crisis.
176	Bernie Sanders	Bottom line is we need a simple system, which exists in Canada, exists in countries all over the world, and that is if you are an American, you get the healthcare you need, end of discussion.
177	Bernie Sanders	We can save huge sums of money doing that.
178	Bernie Sanders	The trick is, do we have the guts to take on the healthcare industry, some of which is funding the vice president’s campaign.
179	Bernie Sanders	Do we have the courage to take on the executives at the prescription drug industry …
180	Dana Bash	Thank you, Senator.
181	Bernie Sanders	… some of whom are funding his campaign.
182	Dana Bash	Vice President Biden.
183	Joe Biden	Look, this is a national crisis.
184	Joe Biden	I don’t want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics here.
185	Joe Biden	I’ve laid out a plan building on Obamacare, providing a public option of Medicare, that would cover everyone the same way.
186	Joe Biden	This idea that this is his only answer is a mistaken notion, but regardless of whether my plan was in place or his, this is a crisis.
187	Joe Biden	This is like we are being attacked from abroad.
188	Joe Biden	This is something that is of great consequence.
189	Joe Biden	This is like a war, and in a war you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people, and what you do is you, and I have proposed it, and laid it out in detail, everything that you need in terms of dealing with this crisis would be free.
190	Joe Biden	It is paid for by the taxpayers generally, generally.
191	Joe Biden	It has nothing to do with Bernie’s Medicare for all.
192	Joe Biden	By the way, the …
193	Dana Bash	Vice President Biden, thank you.
194	Bernie Sanders	Let me just-
195	Dana Bash	If I may, the vice president had just mentioned war.
196	Dana Bash	Would you deploy the US military in effort to contain the virus?
197	Dana Bash	And if so, how?
198	Bernie Sanders	Well, I think we use all of the tools that make sense.
199	Bernie Sanders	If using the National Guard, which is, folks I think in New York state are already using the National Guard, that is something that has to be done.
200	Bernie Sanders	This is clearly, as the vice president indicated, a national emergency.
201	Bernie Sanders	What I worry about is not only how we respond aggressively to the virus, but also how we respond aggressively to the economic fallout of a global recession.
202	Bernie Sanders	Right now in Illinois and Ohio, if my memory is correct, the governor there has said they’re closing down bars.
203	Bernie Sanders	They’re closing down restaurants.
204	Bernie Sanders	What happens to the workers who are there?
205	Bernie Sanders	What happens to the millions of workers who may end up losing their jobs?
206	Bernie Sanders	What I think we have got to do right now is if Trump can provide, or the fed can provide a trillion and a half for liquidity for the banks, what we’ve got to say to every worker in America, you know what?
207	Bernie Sanders	Don’t panic.
208	Bernie Sanders	You’re not going to … You’ll be able to pay your mortgage, because you’re going to get a check.
209	Dana Bash	Senator-
210	Bernie Sanders	You’re going to be made whole.
211	Dana Bash	Senator, we’re going to talk about the economic … Oh, go ahead, Mr. Vice President.
212	Joe Biden	The answer is I would call out the military.
213	Dana Bash	Okay.
214	Joe Biden	Now.
215	Joe Biden	They have the capacity to provide this surge help that hospitals need and that is needed across the nation.
216	Joe Biden	I would make sure that they did exactly what they’re prepared to do.
217	Joe Biden	They’ve done it.
218	Joe Biden	They did it in the Ebola crisis.
219	Joe Biden	They’ve done it.
220	Joe Biden	They have the capacity to build 500-bed hospitals, and tents that are completely safe and secure, and provide the help to get it done to anybody, this overflow.
221	Joe Biden	So it is a national emergency.
222	Joe Biden	I would call out the military.
223	Bernie Sanders	Well, the Ebola crisis is one thing.
224	Bernie Sanders	This is obviously a pandemic which is far more severe and impactful to this country.
225	Bernie Sanders	I think one of the things that we want to remember here is that we got a lot of elderly people in this country who are told, stay home.
226	Bernie Sanders	Don’t leave your house.
227	Bernie Sanders	Who’s going to get food to them?
228	Bernie Sanders	How do we get food to them?
229	Bernie Sanders	You’ve got schools all over this country now being shut down.
230	Bernie Sanders	Okay.
231	Bernie Sanders	How are we going to make sure that the kids do well in this crisis, not become traumatized?
232	Bernie Sanders	What do we do about the parents now who have to stay home with the kids and can’t go to work?
233	Bernie Sanders	I think what bottom line here is that in this crisis, we have got to start paying attention to the most vulnerable, that includes people who are in prison right now, people who are in homeless shelters right now.
234	Bernie Sanders	What about the half a million people who are homeless tonight?
235	Bernie Sanders	Who’s going to respond to them?
236	Bernie Sanders	Now, in 2008 when we had the Wall Street bailout, they did very well for the people on top.
237	Bernie Sanders	They bailed out the crooks on Wall Street, but they forgot about the suffering of ordinary Americans.
238	Bernie Sanders	This time around, let us learn that lesson.
239	Bernie Sanders	Let us pay attention to the working families in this country.
240	Dana Bash	Thank you, Senator.
241	Bernie Sanders	We have the most vulnerable.
242	Joe Biden	We have learned that lesson, and again, I lay out in detail.
243	Joe Biden	What we should be doing now is we should be surging help to those places which are the most vulnerable.
244	Joe Biden	We should have every single person that’s in a nursing home being able to be tested.
245	Joe Biden	We should be moving forces in to do that.
246	Joe Biden	We should move in the capability to do that.
247	Joe Biden	We should be sitting down, the president should be sitting down in The Situation Room right now and doing what we did before, and asking the question, “Okay, you’re going to close everything.
248	Joe Biden	Well, if you close everything, how do you get prescriptions that have to be filled?
249	Joe Biden	How do you make sure when you close that school those children are going to be able to get the school food program?
250	Joe Biden	How do you make sure that you’re going to be able to see to it that you get your mortgage paid?” I propose that all of that be covered, and it’s going to take a multi-multi-billion dollar program to do that.
251	Joe Biden	But first things first, the first thing is take care of the immediate needs we have now relating to surging the kind-
252	Joe Biden	Take care of the immediate needs we have now relating to surging the kind of capability we have to prevent this great bump in terms of how it’s going to cause such pain, as well as moving in the direction of making sure we have a longterm plan to make sure it’s taken care-
253	Dana Bash	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
254	Dana Bash	We’re going to talk in a moment a lot more about the economic impact, but first, Senator Sanders, I want to ask about China.
255	Dana Bash	When this outbreak first started in China, the government there censored the whistleblower doctor who sounded the alarm and downplayed the true gravity of the virus.
256	Bernie Sanders	Right.
257	Dana Bash	What consequences should China face for its role in this global crisis?
258	Bernie Sanders	Well, one of the consequences is we have got to learn that you cannot lie to the American people.
259	Bernie Sanders	You cannot be less than frank about the nature of the crisis.
260	Bernie Sanders	And what bothers me very much is you have a president of the United States today, Mr. Trump, who was praising China, for the good work that they are doing, when in fact, as you indicated, they were lying to their own people and allowing that [inaudible 00:21:02] the case.
261	Bernie Sanders	Look, I don’t think this is the time for recrimination, to be punishing people.
262	Bernie Sanders	Now is the time, by the way, to be working with China.
263	Bernie Sanders	They are learning a lot about this crisis, and in fact, we have got to work with them.
264	Bernie Sanders	We’ve got to work with the World Health Organization.
265	Bernie Sanders	We’ve got to work with Italy.
266	Bernie Sanders	We’ve got to work with countries around the world.
267	Bernie Sanders	If there was ever a moment when the entire world is in this together, got to support each other, this is that moment.
268	Joe Biden	If I may respond.
269	Joe Biden	That’s why I insisted, the moment this broke out, that we should insist on having our experts in China, in China to see what was happening, and make it clear to China there’d be consequences if we did not have that access.
270	Joe Biden	We have to lead the world.
271	Joe Biden	We should be the ones doing what we did during the Ebola crisis, bringing the whole world together and saying, “This is what we must do.” We have to have a common plan.
272	Joe Biden	All nations are affected the same way by this virus depending on exposure.
273	Joe Biden	And so this is, we need world leadership.
274	Joe Biden	We need international leadership.
275	Joe Biden	We need someone who knows how to bring the world together and insist on fundamental change in the way in which we’re approaching this.
276	Dana Bash	Senator Sanders?
277	Bernie Sanders	Well, the bottom line here is that in the midst of this crisis, we have got to act in an unprecedented way.
278	Bernie Sanders	And that means every country on earth is going to be affected.
279	Bernie Sanders	Every country on earth has got to work together.
280	Bernie Sanders	It also means that we tell the pharmaceutical industry, we tell the big money interests, that this is not a time for profiteering.
281	Bernie Sanders	This is a time for all of us working together.
282	Bernie Sanders	The World Health Organization is a very, very strong organization.
283	Bernie Sanders	It is sad that we have a President that has ignored the international community in so many ways, including in terms of international health crisis.
284	Ilia Calderón	Thank you, Senator Sanders.
285	Ilia Calderón	Obviously, another part of this story is the economy, which is reeling from this pandemic.
286	Ilia Calderón	Many economists are warning of a recession.
287	Ilia Calderón	Just hours ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near 0%, which has not happened since the financial crisis in 2008.
288	Ilia Calderón	Vice President Biden, what would you do?
289	Joe Biden	What I would do is make it clear to the world and make it clear to the United States that we are going to have to have a major, major, major bailout package that we do not reward corporations, we reward individuals who in fact are really put to the test here.
290	Joe Biden	The problem is, the policies of this administration economically have… We’ve eaten a lot of our seed corn here.
291	Joe Biden	The ability for us to use levers that were available before have been used up by this godawful tax cut of $1.9 trillion.
292	Joe Biden	By the fact that we have used… The fed will be of little consequence now, they’ve already used what leverage they have, and so we’re going to have to just level with the American people.
293	Joe Biden	Here’s the deal.
294	Joe Biden	We’re going to have to not only deal with the immediate crisis, economic crisis, which is the most critical now to let people know their mortgages are going to be paid, their rents are going to be paid, they’re going to have childcare, they’re going to make sure that all their medical bills are cared for relating to this, et cetera.
295	Joe Biden	We have to go beyond that.
296	Joe Biden	We’re going to have to be in a situation where we’re meeting on a daily basis, like we did in the middle of the financial crisis, to decide how we are going to find the wherewithal and the money to be able to see to it.
297	Joe Biden	We hold all these folks harmless.
298	Joe Biden	But not do what Trump wants to do.
299	Joe Biden	For example, he came along and said, “I got a great idea.
300	Joe Biden	Let’s…” Well, you’re going to tell me-
301	Ilia Calderón	Senator Sanders.
302	Bernie Sanders	The Ebola crisis, in my view, exposes the dysfunctionality of our healthcare system and how poorly prepared we are, despite how much money that we spent.
303	Bernie Sanders	The Ebola crisis is also, I think, exposing the cruelty and the unjustness of our economy today.
304	Bernie Sanders	We have more income and wealth inequality in America today than any time in 100 years.
305	Bernie Sanders	And what that means then, in the midst of this crisis… You know, if you’re a multimillionaire, no one’s happy about this crisis.
306	Bernie Sanders	You’re going to get through it.
307	Bernie Sanders	You’re going to get everything you need.
308	Bernie Sanders	You’re not worried about healthcare.
309	Bernie Sanders	You’re not worried about income coming in.
310	Bernie Sanders	Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.
311	Bernie Sanders	We got people who are struggling working two or three jobs to put food on the table.
312	Bernie Sanders	What is going to happen to them?
313	Bernie Sanders	So the lesson to be learned is we have got to move aggressively right now to address the economic crisis as a result of Ebola… Keep talking about Ebola.
314	Bernie Sanders	You got Ebola in my head here right now.
315	Bernie Sanders	As a result of the virus here, the Coronavirus.
316	Bernie Sanders	What we have got to do also is understand the fragility of the economy and how unjust and unfair it is that so few have so much and so many have so little.
317	Joe Biden	People are looking for results, not a revolution.
318	Joe Biden	They want to deal with the results they need right now, and we can do that by making sure that we make everybody whole who has been so badly hurt in terms of they lose their job, in terms of not having the ability to care for their children, in terms of the healthcare costs that they have related to this crisis.
319	Joe Biden	We can make them whole now, now, and put in process a system whereby they all are made whole.
320	Joe Biden	That has nothing to do with a legitimate concern about income equality in America.
321	Joe Biden	That’s real.
322	Joe Biden	That’s real.
323	Joe Biden	But that does not affect the need for us to act swiftly and very thoroughly and in concert with all the forces that we need to bring to bear to deal with the crisis now, so no one’s thrown out of their home, no one loses their mortgage, no one is kicked out of their house, no one loses their paycheck, no one is in a position where they have a significant financial disability as a consequence of this SARS… Of this particular crisis.
324	Ilia Calderón	Thank you, Vice President.
325	Ilia Calderón	Senator Sanders.
326	Bernie Sanders	Well, I think it goes without saying that as a nation we have to respond as forcefully as we can to the current crisis, but it is not good enough not to be understanding how we got here and where we want to go into the future.
327	Bernie Sanders	So how does it happen that today, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, half of our people are scared to death?
328	Bernie Sanders	Good.
329	Bernie Sanders	I agree.
330	Bernie Sanders	In fact, that was my idea originally to make sure that every person in this country is made whole as a result of this crisis.
331	Bernie Sanders	But God willing, this crisis is going to end, and we are going to have to develop an economy in which half of our people are not living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to put food on the table.
332	Joe Biden	I don’t disagree with that.
333	Joe Biden	You were asking about the crisis, what are we going to do about the crisis now?
334	Joe Biden	Which is incredibly consequential to millions and millions of Americans.
335	Joe Biden	And it’s not going to be policy now.
336	Joe Biden	It’s not going to be solved by a change in how we deal with healthcare.
337	Joe Biden	It’s got to be solved with an emergency need right now.
338	Joe Biden	Right now, what do we do?
339	Joe Biden	First thing we do is we make sure that healthcare is available by us having the tools to be able to deal with it, and that requires us to go out and do much more than this president has done in terms of planning.
340	Joe Biden	Secondly, it requires us to be in a position where we’re anticipating what will happen in the next month or weeks in terms of the flow into the healthcare system, by bringing the military along, more hospital beds, more training, more equipment, more equipment to save the first responders, as well.
341	Joe Biden	In addition to that, we then have to also look at what are the immediate needs right today?
342	Joe Biden	How about that person who’s been laid off today?
343	Joe Biden	How about that person who doesn’t have an income today?
344	Joe Biden	They have to know that tomorrow, when the paycheck comes due, you will get that paycheck.
345	Joe Biden	And thirdly, we have to think longterm about how we deal with making all those who have been badly damaged right again, and then we move on.
346	Joe Biden	Then we move on to change the economy in ways that are more profoundly necessary than people think, but do not respond to the immediate needs we have now.
347	Joe Biden	First things first.
348	Ilia Calderón	Thank you, Vice President, Senator Sanders, you voted against bailouts following the 2008 financial crisis.
349	Joe Biden	Yes.
350	Ilia Calderón	Many believe those spending bills were a crucial part of stabilizing the economy back then.
351	Ilia Calderón	Would you support bailouts for industries that are being crushed by the Coronavirus outbreak now?
352	Bernie Sanders	I did.
353	Bernie Sanders	You’re quite right, I voted against the bailout because I believed that the illegal behavior being done by the people on Wall Street should not be rewarded by a bailout.
354	Bernie Sanders	And today, by the way, those banks are more prosperous and own more assets, by and large, than they did back then.
355	Bernie Sanders	They’re bigger now than they were then.
356	Bernie Sanders	I thought at the time that in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality, the people on top… there was surtax on the very wealthy… should bail out.
357	Bernie Sanders	And it’s not just the top bailout.
358	Bernie Sanders	We gave trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to large banks.
359	Bernie Sanders	But to answer your question where we are right now, we need to stabilize the economy, but we can’t repeat what we did in 2008.
360	Bernie Sanders	Joe voted for that.
361	Bernie Sanders	I voted against it.
362	Bernie Sanders	Because we have got to do more than save the banks or the oil companies.
363	Bernie Sanders	Our job right now is to tell every working person in this country, no matter what your income is, you are not going to suffer as a result of this crisis of which you had no control.
364	Ilia Calderón	Vice President Biden.
365	Joe Biden	Had those banks all gone under, all those people Bernie says he cares about would be in deep trouble.
366	Joe Biden	Deep, deep trouble.
367	Joe Biden	All those little folks… we’d have gone out of business… they’d find themselves in the position where they would lose everything that they had in that bank, whether it was $10 or $300 or a savings account.
368	Joe Biden	This was about saving an economy, and it did save the economy, and the banks paid back and they paid back with interest.
369	Joe Biden	I agree with Bernie, some of them should have gone to jail.
370	Joe Biden	That was the big disagreement I had in terms of bailing out, but the question was, they paid back.
371	Joe Biden	In addition to that, also part of that was bailing out the automobile industry, saving thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs over time.
372	Joe Biden	He voted against that as well.
373	Bernie Sanders	No.
374	Bernie Sanders	I did not vote against that.
375	Bernie Sanders	That bailout money was used later on by Bush to protect the automobile industry.
376	Bernie Sanders	But here’s the point-
377	Joe Biden	[crosstalk 00:00:31:48]-
378	Bernie Sanders	…one minute, one minute.
379	Bernie Sanders	Here’s the point here, is that in terms of that bailout, there are ways that you can bail out.
380	Bernie Sanders	When you have a handful of people who have incredible wealth, who have prospered off of the illegal behavior of individuals, in this case on Wall Street, you know what you say to them?
381	Bernie Sanders	And I did.
382	Bernie Sanders	I said this to the Secretary of the Treasury, “You want a bailout?
383	Bernie Sanders	That’s fine.
384	Bernie Sanders	You have your friends pay for it, not working people.” The other point is, as Joe should know, it wasn’t just the 700 billion TARP program.
385	Bernie Sanders	The fed gave trillions and trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to every financial institution in this country and central banks all over the world.
386	Bernie Sanders	That was essentially a grant, because they then could sell that.
387	Bernie Sanders	They can then bring in interest rates much greater than the zero interest loans that they got.
388	Ilia Calderón	Vice President Biden.
389	Joe Biden	Look, the fact of the matter is that if in fact the banks had all gone under, we would be in a great depression.
390	Joe Biden	How do you get out of that?
391	Joe Biden	Now, Bernie’s saying that I guess he’s going to do a wealth tax or something, that the top 1% could pay for everything and they should pay for everything that occurred.
392	Joe Biden	We were talking about tens and hundreds of billions of dollars.
393	Joe Biden	That’s what this was about.
394	Joe Biden	And the fact was that it saved the economy from going into a depression, after we passed the Recovery Act, which I was the one went on, got the three votes to get it changed, that had $900 billion in it and was the thing that kept us from going into a great depression.
395	Ilia Calderón	Vice President Biden, I’m going to stay with you.
396	Ilia Calderón	Many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants, and now even many legal immigrants in the United States, are afraid to seek medical help.
397	Ilia Calderón	How do you ensure they feel safe enough to get treatment to help stop the spread of Coronavirus?
398	Joe Biden	Anyone who shows up to be tested for Coronavirus or gets Coronavirus treated would be held harmless.
399	Joe Biden	Just like I’ve argued all along.
400	Joe Biden	Any woman who crosses the border or is here and being beaten by her husband, but she’s an undocumented, she cannot be deported because she reports.
401	Joe Biden	There are certain things you cannot deport an undocumented person for and that would be one of them.
402	Joe Biden	We want that.
403	Joe Biden	It’s in the interests of everyone.
404	Joe Biden	And those folks who are the xenophobic folks out there, it’s even in their interest that that woman come forward or that man come forward, because it deals with keeping the spread from moving more rapidly.
405	Joe Biden	They will not, should not, under any circumstances, be held accountable and be deported for that purpose, period.
406	Bernie Sanders	I have been criticized because the proposal for Medicare for All that I introduced includes making sure that undocumented people are also covered.
407	Bernie Sanders	And right now, we have the absurd situation where undocumented people who try to do the right thing, they’re sick, they want to go to the doctor, they don’t want to spread this disease, are now standing and thinking about whether ICE is going to deport them.
408	Bernie Sanders	So one of the things that we have to do is to make sure that everybody feels comfortable getting the healthcare that they need.
409	Bernie Sanders	That should be a general principle, above and beyond the Coronavirus.
410	Bernie Sanders	Second of all, we’ve got to end these terrible ICE raids which are terrorizing communities all over this country.
411	Bernie Sanders	And thirdly, to answer your question, the time is long overdue for this country to move to comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for those 11 million undocumented.
412	Bernie Sanders	And furthermore, on day one as President, I would restore the legal status of the 1.8 million young people [crosstalk 00:35:37]-
413	Dana Bash	Senator.
414	Dana Bash	Senator, thank you.
415	Dana Bash	We’re going to talk about immigration in a minute, but first I want to ask about something that’s going on right now.
416	Dana Bash	Again, back to this crisis.
417	Dana Bash	We know that people over the age of 60 and those with underlying medical conditions, especially heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, are the most vulnerable to Coronavirus and are being asked to change their behavior to protect themselves.
418	Dana Bash	So Senator Sanders, I’ll start with you.
419	Dana Bash	You’re 78 years old.
420	Dana Bash	You had a heart attack.
421	Dana Bash	What are you doing to protect yourself?
422	Bernie Sanders	Well, a great deal.
423	Bernie Sanders	I mean, last night we had a fireside chat, not a rally.
424	Bernie Sanders	I love doing rallies and we bring many thousands of people out to our rallies.
425	Bernie Sanders	I enjoy it very much.
426	Bernie Sanders	We’re not doing that right now.
427	Bernie Sanders	In fact, our entire staff is working from home.
428	Bernie Sanders	So on a personal level, what we’re doing is, I’m not shaking hands.
429	Bernie Sanders	Joe and I did not shake hands.
430	Bernie Sanders	I am very careful about the people I am interacting with.
431	Bernie Sanders	I’m using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection.
432	Bernie Sanders	And I have to say, thank God, right now I do not have any symptoms and I feel very grateful for that.
433	Dana Bash	Vice President Biden, you’re 77.
434	Dana Bash	What are you doing to protect yourself?
435	Joe Biden	Well, fortunately, I don’t have any of the underlying conditions you talked about that I have to worry about, number one.
436	Joe Biden	Number two, thank God… for the time being, anything can happen, as my mother would say, knock on wood… that I’m in good health.
437	Joe Biden	Number three, I’m taking all the precautions anyone would take, whether they’re 30 years old or 60 years old or 80 years old.
438	Joe Biden	That is, I’m going to make sure that I do not shake hands any longer.
439	Joe Biden	I do not engage.
440	Joe Biden	We did the same thing.
441	Joe Biden	Our staff is all working from home.
442	Joe Biden	We are not doing rallies any longer.
443	Joe Biden	We’re doing virtual rallies.
444	Joe Biden	We’re doing virtual town hall meetings.
445	Joe Biden	We’re in a situation where now, I do not… as I said, when we encounter people, we’re not going into crowds.
446	Joe Biden	And so I’m taking all the precautions everyone else should be taking.
447	Joe Biden	I wash my hands God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap.
448	Joe Biden	I carry with me… as a matter of fact, I have it in my bag outside here… hand sanitizer.
449	Joe Biden	I don’t know how many times a day I use that.
450	Joe Biden	I make sure I don’t touch my face, and so on.
451	Joe Biden	So I’m taking all the precautions we’ve told everybody else to take.
452	Jake Tapper	Let’s turn to the race more broadly now.
453	Jake Tapper	Throughout this campaign, you’ve each laid out starkly different visions for how to bring about change.
454	Jake Tapper	Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.
455	Jake Tapper	You said people want results, not a revolution.
456	Jake Tapper	Make the case for why a revolution is not what the country needs or wants.
457	Joe Biden	We have problems we have to solve now.
458	Joe Biden	Now.
459	Joe Biden	What’s a revolution going to do, disrupt everything in the meantime?
460	Joe Biden	Look, the Senator talks about his Medicare For All.
461	Joe Biden	He still hasn’t told you how he’s going to ever get it past.
462	Joe Biden	He hasn’t told you how in fact there’s any possibility of that happening.
463	Joe Biden	He hadn’t told you how much it’s going to cost.
464	Joe Biden	He hadn’t tell you how it’s going to apply.
465	Joe Biden	It doesn’t kick in for four years, even after it passes.
466	Joe Biden	We want a revolution.
467	Joe Biden	Let’s act now.
468	Joe Biden	Pass the Biden healthcare plan, which takes Obamacare, restores all the cuts made to it.
469	Joe Biden	Subsidize it further.
470	Joe Biden	Provide for lower drug prices.
471	Joe Biden	Make sure that there’s no hidden bills.
472	Joe Biden	Make sure that we invest what I want to invest $50 billion in dealing with underlying diseases that are of great consequence, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and cancer.
473	Joe Biden	Make sure that we have a Medicare option that’s in a public option providing Medicare for us.
474	Joe Biden	We can do that now.
475	Joe Biden	I can get that passed.
476	Joe Biden	I can get that done if I’m President of the United States of America.
477	Joe Biden	That will be a fundamental change and it happens now.
478	Joe Biden	I can tell you from experience, being a significant consumer of healthcare with my sons, my family, all the things we’ve gone through, what people want is hope.
479	Joe Biden	And they need it now, not four years from now.
480	Joe Biden	Bernie still hasn’t told us how he’s going to pay for it.
481	Bernie Sanders	Not quite true.
482	Joe Biden	We’re talking about a $30-plus trillion plan.
483	Bernie Sanders	Not quite true.
484	Jake Tapper	Senator.
485	Bernie Sanders	Look, let’s do something that is very rarely done in the Congress.
486	Bernie Sanders	Let’s do something that the media does.
487	Bernie Sanders	Let’s talk about the reality of American life.
488	Bernie Sanders	Why is it that over the last 45 years, despite the huge increase in productivity and technology, the average worker today’s making a nickel more in real dollars?
489	Bernie Sanders	Why is it that over the last 30 years, the richest 1% have seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth, bottom half of America, $900 billion decline in their wealth?
490	Bernie Sanders	The bottom half of America, $900 billion decline in their wealth.
491	Bernie Sanders	Why is it that we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right?
492	Bernie Sanders	Why are we the only major country not to have paid medical and family leave?
493	Bernie Sanders	Why do we give tax breaks to billionaires, when a half-a-million people are homeless today?
494	Bernie Sanders	And it comes down to something, Jake, we don’t talk about.
495	Bernie Sanders	The power structure in America, who has the power?
496	Bernie Sanders	I’ll tell you who has the power.
497	Bernie Sanders	It’s the people who contribute money.
498	Bernie Sanders	The billionaires who contribute money to political campaigns, who control the legislative agenda.
499	Bernie Sanders	Those people have the power.
500	Bernie Sanders	If you want to make real changes in this country, if you want to create an economy that works for all, not just the few… if you want to guarantee quality healthcare to all, not make $100 billion in profit for the healthcare industry, you know what you need?
501	Bernie Sanders	You need to take on Wall Street.
502	Bernie Sanders	You need to take on the drug companies, and the insurance companies, and the fossil fuel industry.
503	Bernie Sanders	You don’t take campaign contributions from them.
504	Bernie Sanders	You take them on and create an economy that works for all.
505	Joe Biden	You want to do that?
506	Joe Biden	Do what I proposed over 30 years ago, federally fund all elections… My whole healthcare plan, by changing the way in which we deal with capital gains.
507	Joe Biden	People should pay their capital gains based on what their income tax is, and not at 20%.
508	Joe Biden	That would raise $800 billion to pay for my entire medical healthcare plan which would cover everyone.
509	Joe Biden	The fact of the matter is, everything I call for I pay for.
510	Joe Biden	And I do not believe and I have not supported these exorbitant tax cuts for the wealthy.
511	Joe Biden	I strongly opposed the tax cut that this president has put through of $1 trillion, $900 billion.
512	Joe Biden	I said at the time, this was all about trying to eliminate the safety net.
513	Joe Biden	Look, the idea that Bernie implies the way he says things, speaking of negative ads… My lord Bernie, you’re running ads saying I’m opposed to Social Security.
514	Joe Biden	The PolitiFact says it’s a flat lie, and that the Washington Post said is a flat lie.
515	Bernie Sanders	Oh, well.
516	Bernie Sanders	Let me ask you a question, Joe.
517	Joe Biden	Yeah.
518	Bernie Sanders	You’re right here with me.
519	Joe Biden	Yeah.
520	Bernie Sanders	Have you been on the floor of the Senate?
521	Bernie Sanders	You were in the Senate for a few years.
522	Joe Biden	Yeah.
523	Bernie Sanders	Time and time again talking about the necessity, with pride, about cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, cutting veterans programs.
524	Joe Biden	No.
525	Bernie Sanders	You never said that?
526	Joe Biden	No.
527	Bernie Sanders	All right.
528	Bernie Sanders	America, go to the website right now.
529	Bernie Sanders	Go to the YouTube right now.
530	Bernie Sanders	Time after time, you were not a fan of Bowles-Simpson.
531	Joe Biden	I was not a fan of Bowles-
532	Bernie Sanders	You were not a fan of the balanced budget amendment, which called for cuts in Social Security?
533	Bernie Sanders	Come on Joe, you were.
534	Joe Biden	Look, here’s the deal.
535	Bernie Sanders	You’re an honest guy.
536	Bernie Sanders	Why don’t you just tell the truth here?
537	Bernie Sanders	We all make mistakes.
538	Joe Biden	I am telling the truth.
539	Joe Biden	You said that I, in fact… Why am I rated 96% by the Social Security organizations?
540	Joe Biden	Why am I viewed as a strong-
541	Bernie Sanders	Organizations-
542	Joe Biden	I have laid out how I will increase Social Security benefits.
543	Bernie Sanders	That’s good.
544	Bernie Sanders	I laid that out.
545	Joe Biden	I have laid out how I am going to make sure that it is in fact, paid for.
546	Bernie Sanders	Jake-
547	Joe Biden	Go to joebiden.com.
548	Joe Biden	Look at my exchange with Paul Ryan on his desire to try to privatize and/or cut Social Security, and understand how he manipulated it.
549	Bernie Sanders	All right.
550	Bernie Sanders	Joe, let me repeat it again.
551	Bernie Sanders	I want you just to be straight with the American people.
552	Bernie Sanders	I am saying that you have been on the floor of the Senate time and time again, talking about the need to cut Social Security, Medicare, and veterans programs.
553	Bernie Sanders	Is that true or is that not true?
554	Joe Biden	No, it’s not true.
555	Bernie Sanders	That is not true?
556	Joe Biden	That is not true.
557	Joe Biden	What is true is, in terms of the negotiations that are taking place, how to deal with the deficit… Everything was on the table.
558	Joe Biden	I did not support any of those cuts, and Social Security or in veterans benefits.
559	Bernie Sanders	Whoa.
560	Bernie Sanders	Whoa.
561	Bernie Sanders	Whoa.
562	Bernie Sanders	Everything was on the table.
563	Bernie Sanders	All right, you’re right.
564	Bernie Sanders	You just said it.
565	Bernie Sanders	Including in your judgment, cuts to Social Security and veterans.
566	Joe Biden	In order to get the kinds of changes we need on other things related., but we did not cut it.
567	Joe Biden	I did not vote for it.
568	Bernie Sanders	I know, because people like me helped stop that.
569	Bernie Sanders	But Joe, you just contradict-
570	Joe Biden	Come on, Bernie.
571	Bernie Sanders	Joe, you just contradicted yourself.
572	Bernie Sanders	One minute… Excuse me.
573	Bernie Sanders	One minute you said, “I was not on the floor.” The next minute you say, “Well yes, there was a reason why I was worried about the deficit.” Maybe that’s good reason, maybe it’s not.
574	Bernie Sanders	All that I am saying is you were prepared to cut, and advocated for the cuts of programs.
575	Joe Biden	Let’s just… I did not.
576	Joe Biden	I never voted to cut Social Security.
577	Bernie Sanders	I’m not talking about voting, Joe.
578	Bernie Sanders	That’s not what I said.
579	Joe Biden	I never voted… Well, look.
580	Joe Biden	I voted to protect it.
581	Joe Biden	Just go look at the debate with Paul Ryan for the vice presidency.
582	Joe Biden	Look at what I did.
583	Joe Biden	And Bernie, will you acknowledge your campaign took out of context, that whole exchange between Paul Ryan?
584	Joe Biden	Are you saying PolitiFact is wrong?
585	Joe Biden	Are you saying-
586	Bernie Sanders	Yeah.
587	Bernie Sanders	Well, believe me, the Washington Post, PolitiFact is wrong a whole lot of times.
588	Joe Biden	Are they wrong on that, Bernie?
589	Joe Biden	Are they wrong on that, Bernie?
590	Bernie Sanders	Joe.
591	Joe Biden	Bernie, did you miss-
592	Bernie Sanders	Joe, did you… Wait a minute.
593	Bernie Sanders	I’ll answer your question.
594	Bernie Sanders	You answer mine.
595	Joe Biden	I answered yours.
596	Bernie Sanders	No, you didn’t.
597	Joe Biden	All right.
598	Bernie Sanders	One more time.
599	Bernie Sanders	Were you on the floor time and time again, for whatever reason, talking about the need to cut Social Security and Medicare and veterans programs?
600	Joe Biden	No, I did not talk about the need to cut any of those programs.
601	Bernie Sanders	Okay.
602	Bernie Sanders	All that I would say to the American people, go to YouTube.
603	Bernie Sanders	It’s all over the place.
604	Bernie Sanders	Joe said it many, many times.
605	Bernie Sanders	I’m surprised.
606	Bernie Sanders	You can defend it or change your mind on it, but you can’t deny the reality.
607	Dana Bash	So Senator, because you brought up Social Security and you have been talking about it, I want to ask you about something that you wrote in 1996.
608	Dana Bash	You were a member of the House, and you wrote an op ed that said, “It is clear we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security, taxes and benefits.”
609	Bernie Sanders	Yeah.
610	Dana Bash	Why are your past comments any less relevant than the vice president’s?
611	Bernie Sanders	Incremental adjustments are what I advocated.
612	Bernie Sanders	Adjustments that I advocated and have advocated for years, is among other things, increasing the cost of living assistance.
613	Bernie Sanders	No, you’re not going to find me ever calling for cuts to Social Security.
614	Bernie Sanders	Right now for example, we determine COLAs by looking at inflation for the general population rather than segregating the higher costs that seniors are paying for prescription drugs and for healthcare.
615	Bernie Sanders	That’s what I was talking about.
616	Bernie Sanders	I have in fact, when Joe and others were enamored with the so-called Bowles-Simpson effort, which included cuts to Social Security or raising the retirement age.
617	Bernie Sanders	I formed along with people like Barbara Boxer, the defending Social Security caucus to say no… when 20% of our seniors who are trying to get by on $13,000 a year or more, we are not going to cut Social Security.
618	Ilia Calderón	Vice President Biden, yesterday you endorsed an Elizabeth Warren plan that would undo key parts of the bankruptcy law you helped pass in 2005.
619	Ilia Calderón	A few hours ago, you announced support for making public college tuition free for families who make less than $125, 000 a year, something Senator Sanders has supported.
620	Ilia Calderón	What changed?
621	Joe Biden	Two things.
622	Joe Biden	Number one, let’s talk about the Bankruptcy Bill.
623	Joe Biden	The Bankruptcy Bill was passing overwhelmingly and I improved it.
624	Joe Biden	I had a choice.
625	Joe Biden	It was going to pass, and a Republican president, Republican Congress.
626	Joe Biden	I offered two amendments to make sure that people under $50,000 would not be affected, and women and children would go to the front of the line on alimony and support payments.
627	Joe Biden	That’s what I did.
628	Joe Biden	It passed overwhelmingly.
629	Joe Biden	I did not like the rest of the bill.
630	Joe Biden	But I improved it, number one.
631	Joe Biden	Number two, I’ve talked with Senator Warren about her proposal.
632	Joe Biden	This is the first opportunity we’ve had to make substantial change in what we couldn’t get done in a Republican administration.
633	Joe Biden	That’s why we talked last… two nights ago, and I supported her proposal.
634	Joe Biden	It’s a good proposal, it’s a solid proposal.
635	Joe Biden	She should get credit for having introduced it.
636	Joe Biden	With regard to what we’re talking about in terms of college education… I’ve been saying for a long time that we’re in a position where 12 years of education is not enough, is not enough for the 21st century.
637	Joe Biden	We need 16 years of education.
638	Joe Biden	The exact bill that Senator Sanders introduced, I guess a little over a year ago, capping it off at $125,000 in income.
639	Joe Biden	You could get free up to that point.
640	Joe Biden	After that, you’d have to pay for your college education.
641	Joe Biden	It only worked for public schools, and it would work for public universities in your state.
642	Joe Biden	I support that idea.
643	Joe Biden	It was a good idea and I support it.
644	Joe Biden	That’s what it is.
645	Joe Biden	I’m not saying everything Bernie’s said has been wrong, he happens to be right on that one.
646	Ilia Calderón	Senator Sanders, I assume you welcome these changes.
647	Bernie Sanders	Look, this is a little bit about leadership as well.
648	Bernie Sanders	Joe talked about bankruptcy.
649	Bernie Sanders	Joe, if my memory is correct, you helped write that Bankruptcy Bill.
650	Joe Biden	I did not.
651	Bernie Sanders	All right.
652	Joe Biden	I did not.
653	Bernie Sanders	That Bankruptcy Bill… By the way, when we talk about education, we got 45 million people in America struggling with student debt, some of them really struggling with student debt.
654	Bernie Sanders	That Bankruptcy Bill made it impossible, very difficult for people to escape from that student debt.
655	Bernie Sanders	It was a very, very bad bill.
656	Bernie Sanders	You said, Joe, that a majority of the people in the Senate voted for it.
657	Bernie Sanders	You’re right.
658	Joe Biden	Overwhelming majority.
659	Bernie Sanders	Overwhelmingly.
660	Bernie Sanders	Well, I voted against it in the House, and I was right.
661	Bernie Sanders	I don’t have to rethink my position, because that’s what leadership is about.
662	Bernie Sanders	Having the guts to take an unpopular vote.
663	Bernie Sanders	But it’s not just bankruptcy.
664	Bernie Sanders	The difference between Joe and I on higher education is… four years ago, it was not a popular idea, Joe.
665	Bernie Sanders	Glad you’re coming around now.
666	Bernie Sanders	Four years ago, when I said that public colleges and universities should be tuition free, people were saying, “Bernie, that’s a radical idea.” Well, you got states and cities and counties all over the country that are moving in that direction.
667	Bernie Sanders	I’m glad that Joe was on board.
668	Bernie Sanders	But what leadership is about, is going forward when it’s not popular, when it’s an idea that you get criticized for.
669	Bernie Sanders	So I’m proud of that fact, and I’m proud of my leadership on many issues.
670	Bernie Sanders	Joe, since the campaign, has come around.
671	Bernie Sanders	I talked about raising that minimum wage 15-bucks-an-hour, four years ago, Joe.
672	Joe Biden	So did I, and I went out and campaigned for it.
673	Bernie Sanders	$15 an hour?
674	Joe Biden	$15 an hour, in New York city.
675	Joe Biden	Go to the Governor.
676	Bernie Sanders	I will talk to the Governor.
677	Bernie Sanders	I am not aware of it.
678	Bernie Sanders	I am not aware of it.
679	Joe Biden	You should be aware of it.
680	Bernie Sanders	All right.
681	Bernie Sanders	Four years ago, it was a radical idea.
682	Bernie Sanders	Very few people in Congress were talking about it.
683	Ilia Calderón	Go ahead, Vice President.
684	Joe Biden	Well here, look.
685	Joe Biden	Let’s get something straight about the Bankruptcy Bill.
686	Joe Biden	The Bankruptcy Bill already… It did not affect student debt for 90%, because the law had already been passed.
687	Joe Biden	You could not declare bankruptcy for those loans that were from private institutions.
688	Joe Biden	You couldn’t do it, as the Bankruptcy Bill did not affect that.
689	Joe Biden	It affected 10% of the people, the first Bankruptcy Bill.
690	Joe Biden	10% of the student loans, number one.
691	Joe Biden	Number two.
692	Joe Biden	Now we’re in a position where we’re able to correct that problem.
693	Joe Biden	The fact is, if I hadn’t stepped up and changed the law as it relates to people making less than $50,000, those who… for alimony and child support, then guess what?
694	Joe Biden	They would have been in the bucket too.
695	Joe Biden	It was going to pass anyway.
696	Joe Biden	I made it… Let me finish.
697	Joe Biden	I made incrementally better.
698	Joe Biden	I did not like the bill.
699	Joe Biden	I did not support the bill.
700	Joe Biden	And I made it clear to the industry, I didn’t like the bill.
701	Joe Biden	Number two, this bill now calls for the opportunity to fundamentally change the mistakes we couldn’t correct in the bill the first time around.
702	Joe Biden	That is why I support Elizabeth Warren’s idea, and it’s a very good idea.
703	Ilia Calderón	Senator Sanders, go ahead.
704	Bernie Sanders	Well, this is kind of circular logic.
705	Bernie Sanders	We’re going to reform the bill that I voted for.
706	Bernie Sanders	Well, if you hadn’t voted for it, and if you rallied other people as I tried to do in the House voting against it, we might not have the problems with it we have today.
707	Bernie Sanders	What leadership is about, Joe, it deals whether your opposition or your support, I should say, for legislation regarding gay communities and the so-called Defense of Marriage Act.
708	Bernie Sanders	You remember that bill, right?
709	Bernie Sanders	You remember?
710	Joe Biden	Yes, I do.
711	Bernie Sanders	Gay marriage today is considered a little bit differently than it was 25 years ago.
712	Bernie Sanders	I remember that vote.
713	Bernie Sanders	It was a very hard vote.
714	Bernie Sanders	I voted against the Defense of Marriage Act.
715	Bernie Sanders	You voted for it.
716	Bernie Sanders	I voted against the Bankruptcy Bill.
717	Bernie Sanders	You voted for it.
718	Bernie Sanders	I voted against the war in Iraq, which was also a tough vote.
719	Bernie Sanders	You voted for.
720	Bernie Sanders	I voted against disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA and PNT all with China, which costs this country over four million good paying jobs.
721	Bernie Sanders	You voted for it.
722	Bernie Sanders	I voted against the Hyde Amendment, which denies low income women the right to get an abortion.
723	Bernie Sanders	You have consistently voted for it.
724	Bernie Sanders	I don’t know what your position is on it today, but you have consistently voted for it.
725	Bernie Sanders	In other words, all that I’m saying here, we can argue about the merits of the bill.
726	Ilia Calderón	Vice President Biden-
727	Bernie Sanders	It takes courage sometimes to do the right thing.
728	Joe Biden	We can argue about the past and the future.
729	Joe Biden	This man voted against the Brady Bill five times.
730	Joe Biden	Background checks, background checks.
731	Joe Biden	Five times, number one.
732	Joe Biden	Number two, this man is the only… one of the few Democrats I know who voted to exempt the gun industry from being able to be sued.
733	Joe Biden	Talk about a special, special interest.
734	Joe Biden	We should be able to sue drug companies.
735	Joe Biden	We should be able to sue tobacco companies.
736	Joe Biden	We cannot sue the gun manufacturers, because he voted for that years ago.
737	Joe Biden	He says it was a mistake now.
738	Joe Biden	I’m prepared to accept he says it’s a mistake.
739	Joe Biden	The question is, what do we do from this point on?
740	Joe Biden	And by the way, I might add, I’m the first person to go on national television in any administration and say, I supported gay marriage.
741	Joe Biden	I supported gay marriage when asked.
742	Joe Biden	It started a ripple effect for gay marriage on national television.
743	Bernie Sanders	All that I’m saying here-
744	Joe Biden	Leadership.
745	Bernie Sanders	We could argue this or that bill.
746	Bernie Sanders	But what I’m suggesting is that in this time of crisis, when we live in a really, really unsettling world… economically, from a healthcare prospective with the coronavirus, the people of America know my record.
747	Bernie Sanders	Okay?
748	Bernie Sanders	For 30 years, I have stood with the working families of this country.
749	Bernie Sanders	I have taken on every special interest there is out there, and that is what I will do in the White House.
750	Bernie Sanders	That’s a very different record than Joe’s.
751	Joe Biden	That is not a different record than mine.
752	Bernie Sanders	That is a totally different record than yours.
753	Bernie Sanders	All right?
754	Bernie Sanders	I mean, it’s manifested in this campaign when you’re getting all this money from wealthy people and billionaires.
755	Bernie Sanders	I think, if you want somebody who will take to the White House what I have done for my whole life-
756	Jake Tapper	Thank you Senator Sanders.
757	Bernie Sanders	And that is take on special interest, I think I’m that candidate.
758	Joe Biden	The average campaign contribution, $44.
759	Jake Tapper	Let’s talk about the future, Vice President Biden.
760	Jake Tapper	If you become the Democratic Presidential nominee, how will you appeal to supporters of Senator Sanders when you do disagree on so many issues?
761	Joe Biden	He’s making it hard for me right now.
762	Joe Biden	I was trying to give him credit for some things.
763	Joe Biden	He won’t even take the credit for things he wants to do.
764	Joe Biden	Look, I think that I want to make it clear that Bernie as a nominee, I will not only support him, I will campaign for him.
765	Joe Biden	I believe the people who support me will do the same thing.
766	Joe Biden	Because the existential threat to the United States of America is Donald Trump.
767	Joe Biden	It’s critical.
768	Joe Biden	I would hope that Bernie would do the same thing if I am the nominee, and encourage all of his followers to in fact, support me as well.
769	Joe Biden	Because it’s much bigger than either of us.
770	Joe Biden	Character of the nation is on the ballot.
771	Joe Biden	It goes well beyond whether or not Senator Sanders and I both agree, we need medic… healthcare should be a right, not a privilege.
772	Joe Biden	We both agree we have to deal with student debt.
773	Joe Biden	We both agree we have to deal with education and access to education.
774	Joe Biden	We both agree that we have a new Green Deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity.
775	Joe Biden	We disagree on the detail of how we do it, but we don’t disagree on the principle.
776	Joe Biden	We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything.
777	Joe Biden	This is a man who wants to cut Social Security, cut Medicare.
778	Joe Biden	Not Bernie, the President of the United States.
779	Joe Biden	So this is much bigger than whether or not I’m the nominee or Bernie’s the nominee.
780	Joe Biden	We must defeat Donald Trump.
781	Joe Biden	He is the… Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change the nature of who we are as a nation.
782	Joe Biden	We’ve got to restore this country’s soul, that’s essential.
783	Joe Biden	As long as this president is there, we’re not going to be able to that.
784	Jake Tapper	Senator Sanders, if-
785	Bernie Sanders	Can I just say a word, then I’ll respond to you?
786	Jake Tapper	Well, it’s just a quick question.
787	Bernie Sanders	Yeah.
788	Jake Tapper	Which is, if he is the nominee, Vice-President Biden… You’ve already said you would support him.
789	Bernie Sanders	Of course.
790	Jake Tapper	But will you campaign for him?
791	Jake Tapper	Will you urge your supporters to-
792	Bernie Sanders	On day one, when I announced my candidacy, what I said is… This country cannot deal with a president who is a pathological liar, was running a corrupt administration or obviously doesn’t know the Constitution of the United States, who believes he’s above law, was a racist and a sexist and a homophobe.
793	Bernie Sanders	He is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country.
794	Bernie Sanders	What I said on day one, Joe, day one, that obviously I hope to win the nomination.
795	Bernie Sanders	But if I don’t win the nomination, I and I think every other Democratic candidate, is prepared to come together to do everything humanly possible to defeat Donald Trump.
796	Bernie Sanders	But let me respond to something that Joe said.
797	Bernie Sanders	We talk about the Green New Deal and all of these things in general terms, but details make a difference.
798	Bernie Sanders	What I have said throughout this campaign, and I don’t think I’ve heard you say this yet, Joe… is that if we’re going to save this planet for our kids and future generations, we need to have the courage to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry and make it clear to them that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.
799	Bernie Sanders	We have a very detailed planet, a detailed proposal.
800	Bernie Sanders	Happy to get the endorsement of the Sunrise Movement.
801	Dr. Sanjay Gupta	… Gupta and this is CNN.
802	Dana Bash	Welcome back to the CNN-Univision Democratic Presidential debate, live from Washington DC.
803	Dana Bash	And as we noted, Arizona will vote on Tuesday.
804	Dana Bash	We solicited questions from undecided Democratic voters there.
805	Dana Bash	One is from Amy Langenfeld, who is a law professor from Chandler, Arizona, with a question for Senator Sanders.
806	Amy Langenfeld	Women are the canaries in the coal mine of the Conservative agenda.
807	Amy Langenfeld	Our access to healthcare is at risk- [crosstalk 00:00:31]… from the Federalist Society’s remaking of the courts.
808	Amy Langenfeld	Our lives are threatened by abusive partners’ access to guns.
809	Amy Langenfeld	Women are disproportionately affected by bail requirements, Social Security cuts and cuts to public education.
810	Amy Langenfeld	How will your Cabinet ensure the best advice on issues that affect women’s physical and financial health?
811	Amy Langenfeld	Thank you.
812	Bernie Sanders	My Cabinet, my administration will look like America, last I heard over half of the people in America are women and that will be the representation in my Cabinet and my administration.
813	Bernie Sanders	And in terms of policies, unlike Joe, I have consistently believed and I have a 100% lifetime voting record from groups like NARAL, that it is a women’s right to control her own body, not the government.
814	Bernie Sanders	I have believed that we have got to move aggressively to deal with domestic violence in this country.
815	Bernie Sanders	I have aggressively and I think effectively, made the case that we cannot have women in America earning 80 cents on the dollar compared to men.
816	Bernie Sanders	And if you’re a minority woman, it’s 50 or 60 cents on the dollar.
817	Bernie Sanders	We need to have universal, affordable, high-quality childcare, so women who are single or married can go off to work and know that their kids are going to be well taken care of.
818	Bernie Sanders	So I think if you look at my agenda, which is on berniesanders.com, what you will find, it is a very strong agenda in fighting for the rights of women, who today are under incredible political assault by Trump and Republican governors all across this country.
819	Dana Bash	Vice President Biden.
820	Joe Biden	Am I able to respond to that?
821	Dana Bash	Please.
822	Joe Biden	Yes, thank you.
823	Joe Biden	Number one, I agree with the question and the underlying premise of Amy’s question.
824	Joe Biden	Number one, I commit it that if I’m elected President and have an opportunity to appoint someone to the courts, I’ll appoint the first black woman to the courts.
825	Joe Biden	It’s required that they have representation, now it’s long overdue.
826	Joe Biden	Secondly, if I’m elected President, my Cabinet, my administration will look like the country.
827	Joe Biden	And I commit that I’ll pick a woman to be Vice President.
828	Joe Biden	There are a number of women who are qualified to be President tomorrow, I would pick a woman to be my Vice President.
829	Joe Biden	Number three, I’m the guy that wrote the domestic violence law and I’m the guy that put in the prohibitions that no one who abuses someone else should be able to own a gun, period.
830	Joe Biden	They should not be able to own a gun.
831	Joe Biden	I would get the boyfriend exception amended, now I’ve gotten it past that.
832	Joe Biden	If you are to get a stay away order from a court, you have a child with someone that you cannot own a gun.
833	Joe Biden	No one should be able in a gun who has abused a woman, period.
834	Dana Bash	Mr. Vice President, if I could just follow up.
835	Dana Bash	Just to be clear, you just committed here tonight that your running mate, if you get the nomination will be a woman?
836	Joe Biden	Yes.
837	Dana Bash	Senator Sanders, will you make that same statement?
838	Bernie Sanders	May I just respond-
839	Dana Bash	Please.
840	Bernie Sanders	… and ask Joe a question?
841	Bernie Sanders	Right now, a woman’s right to control her own body is under massive assault, unprecedented assault.
842	Joe Biden	It is.
843	Bernie Sanders	Joe, you have in the past on more than one occasion, voted for the Hyde Amendment which says that a woman, low-income woman could not use Medicaid funding for an abortion.
844	Bernie Sanders	Is that still your view or have you modified it?
845	Joe Biden	It is not my view.
846	Joe Biden	It is not my view and by the way everybody who’s been in the Congress voted for the Hyde Amendment at one point or another, because it was locked in other bills.
847	Joe Biden	The reason why I affirmatively came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was, that if we’re going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement that you have Hyde Amendment, a woman who doesn’t have the money could not have coverage under healthcare.
848	Bernie Sanders	Well I’m glad.
849	Joe Biden	Number two… And I did that a while ago, okay.
850	Joe Biden	Number one.
851	Joe Biden	Number two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress, when I’m elected President, if I’m elected President, a codification of Roe V Wade amended by Casey because I think it is a woman’s right to choose.
852	Joe Biden	I think it’s a woman’s opportunity to be able to make that decision.
853	Joe Biden	And in fact, I’ve gotten a 100% rating from NARAL as well.
854	Dana Bash	Senator Sanders, before we move on, I just want to get you to respond-
855	Bernie Sanders	Excuse me, you have a lifetime 100% voting record from NARAL?
856	Joe Biden	I know my record of late from NARAL has been 100%.
857	Joe Biden	I don’t know whether it was 25 years ago.
858	Bernie Sanders	Well all right, I mean, I think one of the differences, not to pick a bone here, is I have been consistent.
859	Bernie Sanders	I’ve always believed in that and you have not.
860	Bernie Sanders	I’m glad you’ve changed your views.
861	Dana Bash	Senator, just to be clear, the Vice President committed to picking a woman as his running mate.
862	Dana Bash	If you get the nomination, will you?
863	Bernie Sanders	In all likelihood, I will.
864	Bernie Sanders	For me, it’s not just nominating a woman.
865	Bernie Sanders	It is making sure that we have a progressive women and there are progressive women out there, so my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.
866	Ilia Calderón	Let’s turn now to immigration.
867	Ilia Calderón	Vice President Biden, you recently said for the first time that the Obama-Biden administration made a big mistake in deporting millions of immigrants, but you didn’t publicly speak out against it at the time.
868	Ilia Calderón	What commitment will you make tonight, that as President, you won’t deport millions again?
869	Joe Biden	Number one, I said that it took much too long to get it right and the President did get it right by DACA as well as making sure that it tried to protect parents as well and by the way, moving on an immigration bill as well.
870	Joe Biden	The fact is that we already had a vote on immigration bill, by the way, and Bernie voted against it, the immigration bill.
871	Joe Biden	Had he voted forward and had passed, we’d already have 6 million undocumented would be citizens as I speak right now.
872	Joe Biden	But I will send to the desk immediately a bill that requires access to citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks, number one.
873	Joe Biden	Number two, the first hundred days of my administration, no one, no one will be deported at all.
874	Joe Biden	From that point on, the only deportations that will take place are commissions of felonies in the United States of America.
875	Ilia Calderón	So to be clear, only felons get deported and everyone else gets-
876	Joe Biden	Period.
877	Ilia Calderón	… to stay?
878	Joe Biden	Yes, and the reason-
879	Ilia Calderón	Senator Sanders-
880	Joe Biden	Is, it’s about uniting families.
881	Joe Biden	It’s about making sure that we can both be a nation of immigrants, as well as a nation that is decent.
882	Bernie Sanders	Let me respond and I’ll answer your question.
883	Bernie Sanders	Let me respond to Joe’s comments about the 2007 immigration bill.
884	Bernie Sanders	That bill was opposed by LULAC, the largest Latino organization in America.
885	Bernie Sanders	The Southern Poverty Law Center called it’s guest-worker programs akin to slavery.
886	Bernie Sanders	There wasn’t really a vote on the bill.
887	Bernie Sanders	It was killed because there was a vote on the Dorgan amendment, I think it was 49-48.
888	Bernie Sanders	And you know who voted with me on that one Joe?
889	Bernie Sanders	Barack Obama.
890	Bernie Sanders	He understood that that proposal was a bad idea.
891	Bernie Sanders	We don’t need slavery in America where workers, guest-workers are forced to say with their employers.
892	Bernie Sanders	But in terms of immigration in general, let me outline some of the things that we do.
893	Bernie Sanders	Day one, we restore the legal status of 1.8 million young people and their parents in the DACA program.
894	Bernie Sanders	Number two, immediately, we end these ICE raids, which are terrorizing communities all over this country.
895	Bernie Sanders	Three, we changed the border policy, under my administration, no federal agent will ever grab little babies from the arms of their mothers.
896	Bernie Sanders	And fourth, I think we can pass what the American people want and that is comprehensive immigration reform, path towards citizenship for the 11 million undocumented.
897	Dr. Sanjay Gupta	Senator Sanders, critics suggest, positions like this send a message that when a Democrat is in the White House, the border is open.
898	Dr. Sanjay Gupta	Do they?
899	Bernie Sanders	No.
900	Bernie Sanders	That’s just… I mean that’s what Trump says and that is a total lie.
901	Bernie Sanders	What we’re talking about is a humane, sensible policy supported by the American people.
902	Bernie Sanders	Nobody is talking about open borders and of course Trump lies about that.
903	Bernie Sanders	But the bottom line is, right now you have in this country, people who have been here for decades, they are working hard, they’re raising their kids.
904	Bernie Sanders	They are an important part of our agricultural economy, our construction economy.
905	Bernie Sanders	These are good people and yet they are living in terror and we have got to end that terror and end the ICE raids and move toward a path towards citizenship.
906	Joe Biden	Let me set the record straight on something what was said.
907	Joe Biden	You know the idea that it was slavery, Barack Obama supported that immigration bill.
908	Joe Biden	Teddy Kennedy supported that immigration bill.
909	Joe Biden	I supported it.
910	Joe Biden	I doubt whether those people think it’s slavery.
911	Joe Biden	And by the way, right after his vote against that, he went on the Lou Dobbs show and continued to canard, that they’re taking jobs.
912	Joe Biden	These immigrants are taking jobs from Americans, which is one of the Republican canards, right after that no vote.
913	Joe Biden	And so come on, this is… You think Ted Kennedy is for slavery?
914	Joe Biden	You think I was for slavery?
915	Joe Biden	You think people voted for it for slavery?
916	Bernie Sanders	Just-
917	Joe Biden	And with regard to your question relative to whether or not I would deal with supporting the border.
918	Joe Biden	Look, we can deal with securing the border by national technical means.
919	Joe Biden	All the bad things are coming through ports of entry right now, we don’t need a wall.
920	Joe Biden	And by the way, I would immediately as President, surge to the border, I would end this notion for the first time in history that people seeking asylum have to be in squalor on the other side of the river, in a desperate situation.
921	Joe Biden	They should be able to come to the United States and have a judgment made is whether or not they qualify.
922	Joe Biden	I would also surge to the border immigration judges to make decisions immediately and no one, no one would be put in jail while waiting for their hearing.
923	Ilia Calderón	Senator Sanders?
924	Bernie Sanders	That’s kind of what I’ve been saying throughout the entire campaign.
925	Joe Biden	So have I.
926	Bernie Sanders	So what we need is, at the border, hundreds of administrative judges.
927	Bernie Sanders	We need to deal with people who are seeking asylum, based on international law.
928	Bernie Sanders	We need not to be dividing children from their parents and dividing families up.
929	Bernie Sanders	We need a humane border policy.
930	Bernie Sanders	And I’ll tell you what else we need and I speak as the son of an immigrant.
931	Bernie Sanders	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17, without a nickel in his pocket, couldn’t speak English, didn’t have much of an education.
932	Bernie Sanders	I will end, on day one, the demonization, the ugly demonization from the White House of the immigrant community in this country.
933	Bernie Sanders	We’ve got a President who is trying to divide us up.
934	Bernie Sanders	My administration brings our people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American.
935	Ilia Calderón	Thank you Senator Sanders.
936	Ilia Calderón	Vice President Biden, you opposed sanctuary cities as a Presidential candidate in 2007, where do you stand now?
937	Ilia Calderón	Should undocumented immigrants arrested by local police be turned over to immigration officials?
938	Joe Biden	No.
939	Ilia Calderón	Senator Sanders?
940	Bernie Sanders	Of course not.
941	Bernie Sanders	Look… And one of the things that goes on when you have that process, is that not only the psychological terror, and I’ve talked to these kids, kids are scared to death in America when they come home from school that their mom or dad may not be there, may be deported.
942	Bernie Sanders	What we need to do is to end, and I will end this on day one, the ICE raids that have been so harmful to so many people.
943	Bernie Sanders	And we need to do, again, what the American people want us to do.
944	Bernie Sanders	I’m the son of an immigrant.
945	Bernie Sanders	This is a country significantly built by immigrant labor, built by slave labor and what we have got to do is appreciate each other and end this demonization and the divisiveness this coming from the Trump administration.
946	Jake Tapper	Senator Sanders-
947	Joe Biden	Can I add one thing to that, please?
948	Jake Tapper	Go ahead.
949	Joe Biden	Look, we are a nation of immigrants, our future rests upon the Latino community being fully integrated.
950	Joe Biden	24 out of every 100 children in school today from kindergarten through high school is a Latino, right now today.
951	Joe Biden	The idea that any American thinks it doesn’t pay for us to significantly invest in their future is absolutely a bizarre notion, because if we do not invest everything that the very wealthy are concerned about and the xenophobes are concerned about, will in fact get worse, not better.
952	Joe Biden	We should be embracing, bringing them in, just like what happened with the Irish immigrants after the famine, just what happened with the Italians, et cetera.
953	Joe Biden	We’ve been through this before, xenophobia is a disease.
954	Jake Tapper	Thank you Vice President Biden.
955	Jake Tapper	Let’s move now to the climate crisis.
956	Jake Tapper	I’m coming right to you Senator Sanders.
957	Jake Tapper	The world Health Organization calls the climate crisis, a “Health crisis” and warns that climate change could fuel the spread of infectious diseases.
958	Jake Tapper	Can you point to specific measures in your climate plan that address that threat?
959	Bernie Sanders	Well, of course we do.
960	Bernie Sanders	I mean we… Look, this is what the scientists are telling us, the same scientists who make your point there, Jake.
961	Bernie Sanders	What they’re telling us is, if we don’t get our act together in the next seven or eight years, there would be irreversible damage done to this planet.
962	Bernie Sanders	We’re talking about cities in America, from Miami to New Orleans to Charleston, South Carolina being underwater.
963	Bernie Sanders	We are talking about severe droughts which will prevent farmers in the Midwest from growing the food that we need.
964	Bernie Sanders	We’re talking about extreme weather disturbances which hit Houston Texas, Venice Italy, just a few months ago.
965	Bernie Sanders	We are talking about the absolute need and I want to hear Joe’s position on this.
966	Bernie Sanders	This is not a middle of the ground thing.
967	Bernie Sanders	This is not building a few more solar panels or a few more wind turbines.
968	Bernie Sanders	What this is about is transforming our energy system, as quickly as we humanly can, away from fossil fuel.
969	Bernie Sanders	It is insane that we continue to have fracking in America.
970	Bernie Sanders	It is absurd that we give tens of billions of dollars a year in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.
971	Bernie Sanders	This has got the end and end now if we love our kids and future generations.
972	Jake Tapper	Vice President Biden?
973	Joe Biden	First thing that President Obama and I were summoned to the State Department… Excuse me, the Defense Department for was to meet with all the chiefs, the single greatest threat to our national security, they said, is climate change.
974	Joe Biden	Single greatest threat to our national security, because as populations have to move because they can no longer live where they are, because their islands are sinking, because you saw what happened in Darfur, with the change in weather patterns and the deserted there.
975	Joe Biden	It causes war, it causes great migrations, great migrations.
976	Joe Biden	They said that’s the single biggest problem.
977	Joe Biden	Number two, there’s an awful lot of people today who are in fact getting ill because of the changes in the environment, particularly up where Bernie lives.
978	Joe Biden	I’m not… It has nothing to do with him.
979	Joe Biden	But having, up in the Northeast, because you have everything from beetle infestation and a whole range of things that are causing diseases as well, in addition to eliminating foliage.
980	Joe Biden	But-
981	Jake Tapper	So Vice President Biden, let me ask you then, you talk about this being the number one crisis-
982	Joe Biden	Yes.
983	Jake Tapper	… they told you at the Pentagon.
984	Jake Tapper	The price tag for your climate plan is about $1.7 trillion.
985	Jake Tapper	That’s about $14 trillion less than Senator Sanders wants to spend on this.
986	Jake Tapper	Is your plan ambitious enough to tackle this crisis?
987	Joe Biden	Yes, it is ambitious enough to tackle the crisis, because what… Go to joebiden.com, I lay out the first 13 things I would do immediately upon being elected.
988	Joe Biden	Number one, we’re going to once again reinstate all the cuts the President made and everything from the cafe standards, how far automobiles can go, investing in light rail so that we take cars off the road, making sure we’re in a position where we are now in a position that we put 500,000 charging stations in areas that… [silence 00:17:03] … all new highways that we built, making sure that we spent $500 billion a year… [silence 00:17:22] and the federal government paying for transportation, the vehicles we run, all of those being converted to being able to run on low carbon fuel and/or be able to run on no carbon fuel at all by having them move into a direction that is all carbon free.
989	Joe Biden	We can do these things.
990	Joe Biden	We can lay down the tracks where nothing can be changed by the next President or the following President, the one beyond that.
991	Joe Biden	In addition to that, we also have to… I would immediately rejoin the Paris climate accord, which I helped put together.
992	Joe Biden	I would call the 100 nations, over a hundred nations, but the hundred major polluters to the United States and the first hundred days, to up the ante and make it clear that in fact if they didn’t, there’d be a price to pay.
993	Joe Biden	And lastly, I would be right now organizing the hemisphere and the world, to provide $20 billion for the Amazon, for Brazil no longer to burn the Amazon, so they could have forests… They’re no longer forests but they could have farming and say, “This is what we’re going to do.” … the region is burning out than we admit in one entire year, per year.
994	Jake Tapper	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
995	Jake Tapper	Senator Sanders?
996	Bernie Sanders	All well and good, but nowhere near enough.
997	Bernie Sanders	I mean, you mentioned, we started this debate talking about a warlike situation in terms of the coronavirus and we said, “We have to act accordingly.” You said it.
998	Bernie Sanders	I think you’re right.
999	Bernie Sanders	I said it.
1000	Bernie Sanders	We have to act dramatically, boldly, if we’re going to save lives in this country and around the world.
1001	Bernie Sanders	I look at climate change in exactly the same way.
1002	Bernie Sanders	It’s not a question of reentering the Paris Accord.
1003	Bernie Sanders	That’s fine.
1004	Bernie Sanders	Who cares?
1005	Bernie Sanders	It’s not a big deal.
1006	Bernie Sanders	The deal right now is, do we have the courage?
1007	Bernie Sanders	And this gets back to the point I’m trying to make all night long.
1008	Bernie Sanders	Do we take on the healthcare industry and tell them their profits are not more important than healthcare for all?
1009	Bernie Sanders	Do we take on the fossil fuel industry?
1010	Bernie Sanders	Look, in terms of the fossil fuel industry, these guys have been lying, they’ve been lying for years, like the tobacco industry lied 50 years ago.
1011	Bernie Sanders	“Oh we don’t know if fossil fuels, if oil and carbon emissions are causing climate change.” They knew.
1012	Bernie Sanders	ExxonMobil knew, they lied.
1013	Bernie Sanders	In fact, I think they should be held criminally accountable.
1014	Bernie Sanders	But this Jake, is an issue of enormous consequence.
1015	Bernie Sanders	What Joe was saying goes nowhere near enough.
1016	Bernie Sanders	It’s not a question of money.
1017	Bernie Sanders	Give me a minute here.
1018	Bernie Sanders	We have time to talk about this.
1019	Bernie Sanders	This is a world shaking event.
1020	Jake Tapper	I understand.
1021	Jake Tapper	I just want to give him a chance to respond and then we can come back to you.
1022	Bernie Sanders	Okay, fine let’s stay on.
1023	Jake Tapper	We’re staying on this issue.
1024	Joe Biden	Number one, no more subsidies for fossil fuel industry.
1025	Joe Biden	No more drilling on federal lands.
1026	Joe Biden	No more drilling, including offshore.
1027	Joe Biden	No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one.
1028	Joe Biden	Number two, we’re in a situation as well where we cannot… We are able to move rapidly to change the dynamic, in terms of what we can do to set in motion.
1029	Joe Biden	The fact that he says climate change, Paris Accord doesn’t mean much.
1030	Joe Biden	We could get everything exactly right, we’re 15% of the problem.
1031	Joe Biden	85% of the problem is over there.
1032	Joe Biden	We need someone who can deal internationally.
1033	Joe Biden	We need someone who can bring the together again.
1034	Joe Biden	We need someone who can move in a direction that in fact, if you violate the commitment you make, you will pay an economic price for it.
1035	Joe Biden	Like what’s happening in China there they’re exporting coal, significant coal.
1036	Jake Tapper	Thank you.
1037	Bernie Sanders	Okay.
1038	Bernie Sanders	Look, obviously the Paris Accord is useful, but it doesn’t go anywhere… If you’re laughing Joe, then you’re missing the point.
1039	Joe Biden	You’re missing the point.
1040	Bernie Sanders	This is an existential crisis.
1041	Joe Biden	Bingo.
1042	Bernie Sanders	You talk about… I’m talking about stopping fracking, as soon as we possibly can.
1043	Bernie Sanders	I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet.
1044	Bernie Sanders	No ifs, buts and maybes about it.
1045	Bernie Sanders	I’m talking about speaking-
1046	Joe Biden	So am I.
1047	Bernie Sanders	… to China… Well, I’m not sure your proposal does that.
1048	Bernie Sanders	I’m talking about speaking to China, to Russia, to countries all over the world and in this moment, making the point that instead of spending 1.8 trillion on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.
1049	Bernie Sanders	I know your heart is in the right place, but this requires dramatic, bold action.
1050	Bernie Sanders	We’ve got to take on the fossil fuel industry.
1051	Bernie Sanders	Your plan does not do that.
1052	Joe Biden	My plan takes on the fossil fuel industry and it unites the world.
1053	Joe Biden	He just got finished saying, what’s he going to do?
1054	Joe Biden	He’s going to bring these countries together, making it clear to them.
1055	Joe Biden	I’m saying we bring them together, make them live up to the commitments.
1056	Joe Biden	If they don’t live up to the commitments, they pay a financial price for it.
1057	Joe Biden	They pay an economic price for it.
1058	Joe Biden	Because we can do everything, my state is three feet above sea level.
1059	Joe Biden	I don’t need a lecture on what’s going to happen about rising seas.
1060	Joe Biden	I know what happens.
1061	Joe Biden	I watched the whole Delmarva Peninsula, just like it is in South Carolina and the rest.
1062	Joe Biden	Something I know a little bit about, I wrote the first climate change bill that was in the Congress, which PolitiFact said was a game changer.
1063	Joe Biden	I’m the guy who came along and said with Dick Lugar, that we’re going to trade, we’ll forgive your debt if you don’t cut down your FARs.
1064	Joe Biden	I’ve been way ahead of this curve.
1065	Joe Biden	This idea that all of a sudden Bernie found this out is amazing to me.
1066	Jake Tapper	Senator Sanders?
1067	Bernie Sanders	No, Bernie didn’t find it out.
1068	Bernie Sanders	Bernie is listening to the scientists and what… You’re talking about making countries around the world fulfill their commitments.
1069	Bernie Sanders	Those commitments are not enough.
1070	Bernie Sanders	What this moment is about Joe, is that the scientists are telling us they underestimated the severity of the crisis.
1071	Bernie Sanders	They were wrong.
1072	Bernie Sanders	The problem is more severe.
1073	Bernie Sanders	So all that I’m saying right here is that we are fighting for the future of this planet, for the wellbeing of our kids and future generations.
1074	Bernie Sanders	You cannot continue, as I understand Joe believes, to continue fracking, correct me if I’m wrong.
1075	Bernie Sanders	What we need to do right now is bringing the world together, tell the fossil fuel industry that we are going to move aggressively to win solar, sustainable energies-
1076	Jake Tapper	Thank you.
1077	Bernie Sanders	… and energy efficiency.
1078	Jake Tapper	Thank you Senator.
1079	Joe Biden	No more, no new fracking.
1080	Joe Biden	And by the way, on the Recovery Act, I was able to make sure we invested $90 billion in making sure we brought down the price of solar and wind, that is lower than the price of coal.
1081	Joe Biden	That’s why not another new coal plant will be built.
1082	Joe Biden	I did that while you were watching, number one.
1083	Joe Biden	Number two, we’re in a situation where we in fact have the ability to lay down the tracks where no one can change the dynamic.
1084	Joe Biden	And that’s why we should be talking about things like I’ve been talking about for years, high speed rail, taking millions of automobiles off the road.
1085	Joe Biden	Making sure that we move in a direction where no more, no more drilling on federal lands, making sure that we invest in changing the entire fleet-
1086	Jake Tapper	Thank you.
1087	Joe Biden	… of the United States military to… I know.
1088	Jake Tapper	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
1089	Jake Tapper	Senator Sanders-
1090	Bernie Sanders	Can I respond?
1091	Jake Tapper	… I want to talk to you about fracking because you want to ban fracking-
1092	Bernie Sanders	Yes.
1093	Jake Tapper	… which is a method of extracting natural gas.
1094	Jake Tapper	The shift towards natural gas and away from coal has resulted in reduced US carbon emissions.
1095	Jake Tapper	So how can the US transition to your targeted goal is zero emissions with fracking completely out of the picture?
1096	Bernie Sanders	Because we have to invest in an unprecedented way, in an unprecedented way.
1097	Bernie Sanders	You started off by saying that we’re talking about a 13, $14 trillion investment.
1098	Bernie Sanders	That is a lot of money and I’ve been criticized for that.
1099	Bernie Sanders	But I don’t know what the alternative is, if we are playing for the future of this planet.
1100	Bernie Sanders	So we’ve got to be dramatic and what being dramatic is, massive investments in wind, in solar and sustainable energies in general and research and development, in making our buildings all over this country… In my state of Vermont and around this country, got a lot of old buildings.
1101	Bernie Sanders	We can put millions…
1102	Jake Tapper	Welcome back to the CNN Univision Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday.
1103	Jake Tapper	Voters in Arizona, Ohio, Illinois, and Florida will cast their votes in the democratic primary.
1104	Jake Tapper	Here’s Univision’s Ilia Calderón.
1105	Ilia Calderón	Thank you, Jake.
1106	Ilia Calderón	Let’s move now to foreign policy.
1107	Ilia Calderón	Senator Sanders, there are about 1.5 million Cuban Americans living in Florida right now.
1108	Ilia Calderón	Why would they vote for you when they hear you praise a program of Fidel Castro, a dictator who jailed, tortured, and killed thousands of Cubans.
1109	Bernie Sanders	I have opposed or authoritarianism, whether it’s in Cuba, whether it’s in Saudi Arabia, whether it’s in China or whether it is in Russia.
1110	Bernie Sanders	That is my life record.
1111	Bernie Sanders	I believe unlike the president of the United States, in democracy, not authoritarianism in Cuba or any place else.
1112	Bernie Sanders	What I believe right now in this world is that we are faced with a global crisis and a movement toward authoritarianism.
1113	Bernie Sanders	That’s what Putin in Russia is leading, that’s what MBS in Saudi Arabia is leading.
1114	Bernie Sanders	And as president of the United States, unlike Donald Trump, I will put the flag down and say that in this country and in this world, we have got a move toward democracy and human rights.
1115	Bernie Sanders	That is my view and has always been my view.
1116	Ilia Calderón	To be clear, Senator Sanders, Cuba has been a dictatorship for decades.
1117	Ilia Calderón	Shouldn’t we judge dictators by the violation of human rights and not by any of their alleged achievements?
1118	Bernie Sanders	Well, I think you can make the same point about China.
1119	Bernie Sanders	China is undoubtedly an authoritarian society.
1120	Bernie Sanders	Okay?
1121	Bernie Sanders	But would anybody deny, any economists deny that extreme poverty in China today is much less than what it was 40 or 50 years ago?
1122	Bernie Sanders	That’s a fact.
1123	Bernie Sanders	So I think we condemn authoritarianism, whether it’s in China, Russia, Cuba, any place else.
1124	Bernie Sanders	But to simply say that nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people, would I think be incorrect.
1125	Ilia Calderón	Vice president Biden, you have criticized Senator Sanders for bracing Castro’s education system, but in 2016 president Obama said Cuba made “A great progress in educating young people and that its healthcare system is a huge achievement that they should be congratulated for” How is that different from what Senator Sanders has said?
1126	Joe Biden	He was trying to change Cuban policies so the Cuban people would get out from under the thumb of the Castro and his brother.
1127	Joe Biden	That is to change the policy so that we can impact on Cuba’s policy by getting them opened up.
1128	Joe Biden	That was about, but the praising of the Sandinistas, the praising of Cuba, the praising just now of China.
1129	Joe Biden	China is an authoritarian dictatorship.
1130	Joe Biden	That’s what it is.
1131	Joe Biden	We have to deal with them because they’re there.
1132	Joe Biden	But the idea that they in fact have increased the wealth of people in that country, it’s been marginal that change that’s taken place.
1133	Joe Biden	It is still, they have a million Uyghurs, a million Muslims in prison camps in the West.
1134	Joe Biden	You see what’s happening in Hong Kong today.
1135	Joe Biden	And by the way, the idea that he praised the Soviet Union when it was the Soviet Union about the things that they had done well, they are an awful dictatorship killing millions and millions of people.
1136	Joe Biden	And in addition to that, we have a circumstance where after the election was all over and we knew what was done by the Russians now and interfering with our elections, this man voted against sanctioning Russia for interference in our elections.
1137	Ilia Calderón	Senator Sanders.
1138	Joe Biden	I don’t get it.
1139	Bernie Sanders	Well, what you don’t get in.
1140	Bernie Sanders	This is exactly what the problem with politics is about.
1141	Bernie Sanders	All right.
1142	Bernie Sanders	Question.
1143	Bernie Sanders	Did China make progress in ending extreme poverty over the last 50 years?
1144	Bernie Sanders	That’s a no.
1145	Joe Biden	That’s like saying Jack the ripper.
1146	Bernie Sanders	No, it’s not Joe.
1147	Joe Biden	Yes, it is.
1148	Bernie Sanders	You see, Joe, this is the problem.
1149	Joe Biden	Yes, it is.
1150	Bernie Sanders	This is the problem.
1151	Bernie Sanders	We can’t talk … I know there’s a political line, I understand.
1152	Bernie Sanders	China’s terrible, awful, nothing ever good [inaudible 00:04:10] but the fact of the matter is China, of course is an authoritarian state.
1153	Bernie Sanders	It’s what I just said.
1154	Joe Biden	It’s a dictatorship.
1155	Bernie Sanders	That’s what I just said five minutes ago.
1156	Bernie Sanders	And by the way, the question that was asked quoted Barack Obama, president Obama was more generous in his praise of what Cuba did in healthcare and education than I was.
1157	Bernie Sanders	I was talking about a program 60 years ago in the first year of the Castro revolution.
1158	Bernie Sanders	So the bottom line is, that I think it’s a little bit absurd if we’re going to look at the world the way it is.
1159	Bernie Sanders	Of course, we are opposed to authoritarian.
1160	Bernie Sanders	And by the way, before it was considered good policy, good idea.
1161	Bernie Sanders	I was condemning the dictatorship in Saudi Arabia when a lot of other people in Washington-
1162	Joe Biden	With me.
1163	Bernie Sanders	I was condemning the dictatorship in the UAE, you were not.
1164	Bernie Sanders	Yes, I was.
1165	Ilia Calderón	Thank you, Senator Sanders, Vice president Biden.
1166	Joe Biden	Look, the idea of occasionally saying something nice about a country is one thing.
1167	Joe Biden	The idea of praising a country that is violating human rights around the world is in fact makes our allies wonder what’s going on.
1168	Joe Biden	What do you think the South Koreans think when he praises China like that?
1169	Joe Biden	What do you think the Australians believe in the shadow of China?
1170	Joe Biden	What do you think is happening in Indonesia in the shadow of China?
1171	Joe Biden	What do you think is happening in terms of Japan in the shadow of China?
1172	Joe Biden	Words matter.
1173	Joe Biden	These are flat out dictators, period, and they should be called for it.
1174	Joe Biden	Straight up.
1175	Joe Biden	We may have to work out.
1176	Joe Biden	For example, I was able to help negotiate a new start agreement with Russia, not because I like Putin, the guy is a thug.
1177	Jake Tapper	Mr. Vice president, sticking with foreign policy, you acknowledge that your support and vote for the Iraq war was a mistake.
1178	Jake Tapper	What lessons did you learn from that mistake, and how might those lessons influence your foreign policy decision making as president?
1179	Joe Biden	I learned I can’t take the word of a president when in fact they assured me that they would not use force.
1180	Joe Biden	Remember the context, the context was the United Nations Security Council was going to vote to insist that we allow inspectors into determine whether or not they were in fact producing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction.
1181	Joe Biden	They were not.
1182	Joe Biden	And what’s the first thing that happened when we got elected?
1183	Joe Biden	The president Obama turned to me and said, get those troops out of the hours responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq.
1184	Joe Biden	I admitted 14 years ago was in [spect 00:06:43] to have trusted him and I’m prepared to compare my foreign policy credentials up against my friend here on any day of the week and every day of the week.
1185	Bernie Sanders	Okay, let’s start off with the war in Iraq, Joe, I was there too.
1186	Bernie Sanders	I was in the house.
1187	Bernie Sanders	I understood … and by the way, let’s be clear about what that vote was and you were there at the signing ceremony with Bush.
1188	Bernie Sanders	Everybody in the world knew that when you voted for that resolution, you were giving Bush the authority to go to war and everybody knew that’s exactly what he and Cheney wanted to do.
1189	Bernie Sanders	Most people who followed that issue closely understood that the Bush administration was lying through its teeth with regard to Saddam having weapons of mass destruction.
1190	Bernie Sanders	I understood that, I was on the floor of the house time and time again.
1191	Bernie Sanders	But the issue is not just the war in Iraq.
1192	Bernie Sanders	That was a long time ago.
1193	Bernie Sanders	The issue is the trade agreement.
1194	Bernie Sanders	What is it so easy for me to lead the effort against disastrous trade agreements?
1195	Bernie Sanders	The issue was the bankruptcy bill that you supported.
1196	Bernie Sanders	The issue was the Hyde amendment.
1197	Bernie Sanders	The issue is the defense of marriage Act.
1198	Bernie Sanders	The issue is whether or not in difficult times and God knows these are difficult times.
1199	Bernie Sanders	We’re going to have the courage to take on powerful special interest and do what’s right for the working families of this country.
1200	Jake Tapper	Vice president Biden.
1201	Joe Biden	Why did you vote not to sanction the Russians?
1202	Bernie Sanders	You know why?
1203	Bernie Sanders	Because I had every … you keep talking about Iran that was tied to Iran.
1204	Bernie Sanders	Russia was in Iran.
1205	Bernie Sanders	I think John Kerry indicated his support for what I did.
1206	Bernie Sanders	That was undermining the Iranian agreement.
1207	Bernie Sanders	That’s why.
1208	Joe Biden	That’s not true.
1209	Joe Biden	Our [crosstalk 00:08:24]
1210	Bernie Sanders	That’s why, and that’s the only reason why I have condemned Russia time and time again.
1211	Jake Tapper	Vice president Biden.
1212	Joe Biden	The fact is that the idea that I in fact supported the things that you suggested is not accurate.
1213	Joe Biden	Look, I’m the guy that helped put together the Iran deal and got the inspectors in there.
1214	Joe Biden	My chief of staff was the guy, my foreign policy guy doing that negotiation, I was the guy that helped put together a 60-nation organization to take on the ISIS in Iraq and in Syria.
1215	Joe Biden	I’ve dealt with these folks, I know them, and I know what they’re like and I know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.
1216	Joe Biden	The fact is, this Bernie’s notion about how he embraces folks like the Sandinistas and Cuba and the former Soviet Union and talks about the good things they did in China is absolutely contrary to every message we want to send the rest of the world.
1217	Jake Tapper	Senator Sanders.
1218	Bernie Sanders	I have led the effort against all forms of authoritarianism, including America’s so-called allies in the UAE and in Saudi Arabia.
1219	Bernie Sanders	And in fact, as you may know, worked with conservative Republicans to utilize for the very first time the War Powers Act to get the United States out of the horrific war in Yemen led by Saudi Arabia.
1220	Bernie Sanders	That’s what I did.
1221	Bernie Sanders	So my view is that in a world moving toward authoritarianism, the United States has got to be the leader where people all over the world look to us for guidance.
1222	Ilia Calderón	Thank you, Senator.
1223	Ilia Calderón	Thank you gentlemen.
1224	Ilia Calderón	I want to change topics and ask each of you about some of your vulnerabilities in this election.
1225	Ilia Calderón	Starting with you, Vice president Biden, Senator Sanders has one more of the Hispanic vote than you in several key States so far.
1226	Ilia Calderón	In fact, he doubled your support in California among Hispanics.
1227	Ilia Calderón	He almost tripled it in Nevada.
1228	Ilia Calderón	So why is your message not resonating with Hispanic voters?
1229	Joe Biden	Well, look, my message has resonated across the board.
1230	Joe Biden	Every single state we’ve been in, there’s been a significant turnout.
1231	Joe Biden	In Virginia, turnout was up 70%, they voted for me.
1232	Joe Biden	He didn’t bring them out, I brought them out.
1233	Joe Biden	And number two, look what’s happened in Mississippi.
1234	Joe Biden	Look what’s happened in North Carolina, look what’s happened in Washington state.
1235	Joe Biden	Look what’s happening across the board.
1236	Joe Biden	Why is it that I’m winning all those places?
1237	Joe Biden	What’s the reason?
1238	Joe Biden	What’s the reason?
1239	Joe Biden	The reason is because they know I am a Democrat with a capital D who in fact believes that our base is the base of the Democratic party, which are hardworking men and women who are in fact are high school educated, African Americans and minorities, including Hispanics, but all minorities.
1240	Joe Biden	Suburban women, people who in fact have a sense of our place in the world.
1241	Joe Biden	That’s why I am winning, not just winning, but overwhelmingly winning, not even close in these places.
1242	Joe Biden	And-
1243	Bernie Sanders	Well, you didn’t quite win-
1244	Ilia Calderón	Senator Sanders, let me just follow up with you about an issue that you’re having for the second consecutive presidential election.
1245	Ilia Calderón	You’re struggling to gain wide support from African-Americans.
1246	Ilia Calderón	Why is your message not resonating with African-American voters?
1247	Bernie Sanders	Here is what I believe is happening and this is an important point and why I decided to run for president.
1248	Bernie Sanders	I think it’s imperative that we defeat Trump.
1249	Bernie Sanders	I think our campaign of a biracial, bigenerational, multigenerational grassroots movement is the way to do it.
1250	Bernie Sanders	Now we have won some states, Joe has won more States than I have, but here’s what we are winning.
1251	Bernie Sanders	We are winning the ideological struggle.
1252	Bernie Sanders	Even in States like Mississippi where Joe won a major victory.
1253	Bernie Sanders	It turns out that a pretty good majority of the folks there believe in Medicare for … and that’s true in almost every state in this country.
1254	Bernie Sanders	And the other issue that we don’t talk enough about is we are winning the generational struggle.
1255	Bernie Sanders	Depending on the state, we’re winning people 50 years of age or younger, big time people, 30 years of age and younger.
1256	Bernie Sanders	I frankly have my doubts.
1257	Bernie Sanders	Look, if I lose this thing, Joe wins, Joe, I will be there for you.
1258	Bernie Sanders	But I have my doubts about how you win a general election against Trump will be a very, very tough opponent unless you have energy, excitement, the largest voter turnout in history.
1259	Bernie Sanders	And to do that you are going to have to bring young people who are not great voters.
1260	Bernie Sanders	They don’t vote in the kinds of numbers they should into the political process.
1261	Bernie Sanders	You’re going to have to bring Latinos who are great people, have the agenda that we need, but also don’t vote in the numbers that we need.
1262	Bernie Sanders	I have my doubts that vice president Biden’s campaign can generate that energy and excitement and that voter turnout.
1263	Joe Biden	I will do that.
1264	Joe Biden	And by the way, just get this straight.
1265	Joe Biden	The energy and excitement is taking place so far has been for me.
1266	Joe Biden	70% turnout increased in Virginia, I can go down the list, they’re coming out for me and I didn’t even have the money to compete with this man in those States.
1267	Joe Biden	I virtually had no money.
1268	Joe Biden	The press kept saying Biden has no money and they were right by net, no money.
1269	Joe Biden	And the idea, why are they doing that?
1270	Joe Biden	The reason they’re doing that is because they understand I know what has to happen, that I know what needs to be done.
1271	Joe Biden	And by the way, the idea that everybody supports Medicare for all he has still hadn’t indicated how much it’s going to cost people.
1272	Joe Biden	He’s yet to know exactly what’s going to … So here’s my point.
1273	Joe Biden	People don’t know the detail at all and the fact is I am winning-
1274	Ilia Calderón	Thank you, sir.
1275	Joe Biden	… overwhelmingly among democratic constituencies across the board.
1276	Ilia Calderón	Thank you Mr. Vice president.
1277	Ilia Calderón	We are going to be right back with more from the CNN Univision Democratic presidential debates.
1278	Ilia Calderón	Stay right there.
1279	Jake Tapper	Welcome back to the CNN Univision Democratic Presidential Debate.
1280	Jake Tapper	Finally, gentlemen, thanks so much for everything.
1281	Jake Tapper	As we end here tonight, let’s return to where we began, the coronavirus, which does not discriminate based on ideology.
1282	Jake Tapper	It does not care if one is a Democrat or Republican, a Conservative, a Moderate or a Progressive.
1283	Jake Tapper	Senator Sanders, let me start with you.
1284	Jake Tapper	What’s your closing message tonight for those who are concerned about, effected by, or dealing with the coronavirus?
1285	Bernie Sanders	Well, our hearts go out to everyone.
1286	Bernie Sanders	We need to move aggressively, to make sure that every person in this country who has the virus, who thinks they have the virus, understands they get all the healthcare that they need, because they are Americans, that we move aggressively to make sure that the test kits are out there, that the ventilators are out there, that the ICU units are out there, that the medical personnel are out there.
1287	Bernie Sanders	But Jake, if I might also say, that in this moment of economic uncertainty, in addition to the coronavirus, it is time to ask how we get to where we are, not only our lack of preparation for the virus, but how we end up with an economy, with so many about people are hurting at a time of massive income and wealth inequality.
1288	Bernie Sanders	It is time to ask the question of where the power is in America.
1289	Bernie Sanders	Who owns the media?
1290	Bernie Sanders	Who owns the economy?
1291	Bernie Sanders	Who owns the legislative process?
1292	Bernie Sanders	Why do we give tax breaks to billionaires and not raise the minimum wage?
1293	Bernie Sanders	Why do we pump up the oil industry while a half a million people are homeless in America?
1294	Bernie Sanders	This is the time to move aggressively, dealing with the coronavirus crisis, to deal with the economic fallout, but it’s also a time to rethink America, and create a country where we care about each other, rather than a nation of greed and corruption, which is what is taking place among the corporate elite.
1295	Jake Tapper	Thank you, senator Sanders.
1296	Jake Tapper	Vice President Biden, what’s your closing message tonight for those concerned about affected by or dealing with with this virus?
1297	Joe Biden	Number one, as I said at the outset, I just can’t imagine what people are going through right now who have lost someone already.
1298	Joe Biden	I can’t imagine what people are going through when they have a mom.
1299	Joe Biden	Like for example, a good friend of ours is sitting outside the window of a nursing home where her mom is because she can’t go in, trying to do sign language to her mom and through the window to be able to talk to her.
1300	Joe Biden	I guess I can imagine the fear and concern people have.
1301	Joe Biden	Number one, one of the things that I think we have to understand is that this is an all hands on deck.
1302	Joe Biden	This is, as someone said, maybe it was you Jake at the outset, this is bigger than any individual.
1303	Joe Biden	This is bigger than yourself.
1304	Joe Biden	This is about America.
1305	Joe Biden	This is about the world.
1306	Joe Biden	This is about how we bring people together and make the kind of sacrifices we need to make to get this done, and so first and foremost, where we have to do is start to listen to the science again.
1307	Joe Biden	As I said, what we did, we met and that what I’d be doing today, I’d be sitting down in the situation room literally every day like we did at the outset of other crises we had when we were in the White House, and pulling together the best people and not just the United States the world and say, “What is it?
1308	Joe Biden	What are the prescriptive moves we have to take now to lessen this virus to beat it, to go to the point where we can save more lives, get more people tested, get more people to kind of care they need?”
1309	Joe Biden	And then what do we do beyond that to make sure that the economic impact on them is in fact rendered harmless?
1310	Joe Biden	That we in fact make sure every paycheck is met, every paycheck that’s out there that the people are going to miss, that we keep people in their homes, they don’t miss their mortgage payments, they don’t miss their rent payments, making sure that they’re going to be able to take care of education, and by the way, the education systems are closing down right now, and so there’s so many things we have to do.
1311	Joe Biden	In addition to that, we have to do is we have to have the best science in the world and telling us what can stay open and what need be closed.
1312	Joe Biden	Like I said earlier, the idea that we are closing schools, which I understand, but not being able to provide lunches for people who in fact need the school lunch program to get by.
1313	Joe Biden	The idea that we would close any place that I can understand the decision made to close places where a hundred or 50 people or more gather, but how do you keep open the drug store to make sure you can get your prescription?
1314	Joe Biden	How do you deal with the things that necessarily have to be kept going and what’s the way to do that?
1315	Joe Biden	There should be a national standard for that.
1316	Joe Biden	It should be coming out of the situation room right now.
1317	Joe Biden	And by the way, the single most significant thing we can do should deal with the larger problem down the road of income inequality is get rid of Donald Trump, Donald Trump.
1318	Joe Biden	He’s exacerbated every single one of these problems, both the immediate urgent need, and how we’re going to hold people harmless for the damage done as a consequence of this virus.
1319	Joe Biden	It’s important we do both.
1320	Jake Tapper	Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders, I would want to thank you both for being here tonight under these challenging and trying circumstances.
1321	Jake Tapper	We wish both of you the best.
1322	Jake Tapper	Our thanks as well to our partners at Univision.
1323	Jake Tapper	For Ilia Calderon and Dana Bash, I’m Jake Tapper.
1324	Jake Tapper	Thank you so much for watching.
1325	Jake Tapper	Please stay healthy.
1326	Jake Tapper	Stay safe.
1327	Jake Tapper	Our coverage of both tonight’s debate and the coronavirus pandemic continues now with Anderson Cooper.
1328	Anderson Cooper	Jake, thanks very much.
1329	Anderson Cooper	There you have the CNN Univision Democratic Debate, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and a third unwelcome player, the coronavirus.
1330	Anderson Cooper	The candidates acknowledged it at the closed debate in their final remarks.
