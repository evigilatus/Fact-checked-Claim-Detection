He is dividing us as a nation. He is not bringing us together. He\u2019s willfully dividing us. He\u2019s petulant. ...\n\n\"The reality is we believe in a government of three legs, all equal. So if (House Speaker John) Boehner and (Senate Majority Leader Harry) Reid -- well, Reid will do whatever (Obama) tells him -- if Boehner had said I am not coming unless you speak to me in a respectful way, I am third in line to the president, (then I won\u2019t come).\n\n\"Ronald Reagan would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on \u2014 that's how much he revered the presidency. This guy (Obama) worked like hell to be president, okay? He\u2019s got it. Behave like a president.\"\n\nLangone\u2019s comment is heavily opinionated, and at PolitiFact we make it our policy not to fact-check opinions. However, Langone used a vivid example that we think is checkable -- namely, whether it\u2019s true that Reagan \"would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on.\" As we look into that question, we\u2019ll compare Reagan\u2019s sartorial habits in the Oval Office with Obama\u2019s to see whether Langone is justified in using Obama\u2019s clothing choices to support his view that Obama is \"not acting presidential.\"\n\nWe began by contacting people who either worked in the Reagan White House or who covered it as journalists.\n\nAnnelise Anderson said that neither she nor her husband Martin, both of whom worked in the Reagan White House, \"ever saw Reagan in the Oval Office or the Roosevelt Room without a tie and jacket\" and that they\u2019d frequently heard that Reagan didn't even take his jacket off in the heat of summer.\n\n\"Martin was in meetings with Reagan several times a day while he was assistant to the president for policy development,\" she said. \"I was associate director of the Office of Management and Budget and saw the president less often, but always with coat and tie. Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter, was far more casual.\"\n\nAndrea Mitchell, who covered the Reagan White House for NBC News and who now hosts MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell Reports, said she agrees that \"Reagan was more formal than some of his predecessors or successors. My recollection is that Reagan did usually wear his jacket in the Oval Office, as did many other presidents, at least when they were photographed. But there were clearly informal moments, especially on weekends and holidays when they didn\u2019t have outside visitors.\"\n\nFor documentary evidence, we turned to the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif. We reached Steve Branch, an audiovisual archivist with the National Archives and Records Administration, who may know more than anyone else about the official White House photographs of the Reagan era.\n\n\"We do have photos of President Reagan in the Oval Office without a coat and tie, but these only appear to be on weekends and I believe only for his Saturday radio addresses,\" Branch said. \"During the regular work week, he always wore a coat and tie, which is evident from all the photos we have in our collection.\"\n\nAs an example, Branch forwarded us contact sheets from two rolls of film that show Reagan in casual dress. Both were taken when Reagan came in to make a Saturday radio address. We found an additional image of a casual Reagan in the Oval Office in this slide show compiled by the Huffington Post.\n\nMark Weinberg, an assistant press secretary in the Reagan White House, offered a simple explanation for why Reagan decided not to wear a jacket on weekends.\n\n\"He did not want to make everyone coming into work feel like they had to dress up too,\" Weinberg said. \"He knew that if he wore one, everyone else would, and he felt it was not fair to younger staff coming into work on weekends.\"\n\nSo Langone is incorrect when he says that Reagan would \"never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on.\" There\u2019s photographic evidence showing Reagan jacket-less in the Oval Office, but there\u2019s also ample evidence that Reagan usually wore jackets during the work week.\n\nWhat about Langone\u2019s conclusion that Reagan\u2019s dress habits in the White House stemmed from \"how much he revered the presidency\"?\n\nWe heard, particularly from former Reagan aides, that the 40th president treated the office with reverence. \"He made a point of saying the Oval Office was not his, that it belonged to the people, and he was only the custodian,\" Weinberg said. \"I never, ever heard him refer to it as \u2018my office.\u2019\"\n\nHowever, other experts see additional explanations for Reagan\u2019s formality. One issue is the image-making that has shaped the modern presidency.\n\nReagan, who polished his skills as an actor in Hollywood, has been widely hailed as a modern master of image-making. When Reagan was at his ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif., he tended to wear western garb. In Washington, he tended to dress more formally. Both styles complemented and reinforced each other, helping define a clear persona of someone who was robust and in charge.\n\n\"Reagan understood that the image one projects helps shape the public\u2019s view, and I suspect it is not just generational that a president who carries himself in a more formal, dignified manner projects by that a bit more gravitas than a president who dresses and acts like he\u2019s just \u2018one of the guys,\u2019\" said Sam Donaldson, who covered the Reagan White House for ABC News.\n\nTo the extent that Obama has sometimes appeared without a jacket for Oval Office meetings, his decision communicates something different, said Bronwyn Cosgrave, the author of Sample: Cuttings from Contemporary Fashion and Costume & Fashion: A Complete History. Cosgrave said Obama in shirtsleeves \"projects the sense that he is actually rolling up his sleeves, getting down to business and tackling the task of running the country,\"\n\nThe other factor has to do with the norms for a man of Reagan\u2019s generation.\n\nLou Cannon, an author and journalist who covered Reagan both as California governor and as president, told PolitiFact that \"Reagan certainly did revere the office of the presidency, but, in my view, the fact he wore a coat and tie to work is mostly generational. He did the same in Sacramento, at least on weekdays, when he was governor. People of my father's generation -- he was born seven years before Reagan -- were taught to wear a suit and tie for formal occasions and certainly would have done so in the White House.\"\n\nFashion historians agreed that it\u2019s important to keep in mind generational shifts.\n\n\"The norms for dress have changed since the Reagan years to a much more casual attire,\" said Joanne B. Eicher, editor in chief of the Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion and an emeritus professor of design, housing, and apparel at the University of Minnesota. \"This can even be seen in what people wear for air travel, as one example, then and now.\"\n\nEicher said that \"many men today do not wear complete suits or even jackets with trousers to social functions as once was expected. For example, a prominent business executive I know, about 60, was attending a late afternoon wedding reception last month wearing a well-pressed long-sleeved plaid shirt, with no tie. Times have changed a lot in regard to what is acceptable.\"\n\nWe also tried to judge how often Obama has gone jacket-less in the Oval Office. We did this by looking at the White House Flickr stream, which includes photographs taken by the official White House photographers.\n\nWe found that in the great majority of Oval Office photographs during his presidency, Obama was seen wearing a suit. We did find that Obama was likelier to be jacket-less during his first 100 days in office, with 13 instances during that period.\n\nHowever, in the 26 months since then, Obama has sharply curtailed the number of times he has been caught on camera in the Oval Office without a jacket. We found only eight examples on weekdays during that period, or about one such occasion every three months. (We found two additional cases after the first 100 days when Obama went casual on a weekend or holiday.)\n\nWe also noted that none of these eight occasions included an outsider. All showed Obama either by himself or with top aides or cabinet members.\n\nEicher, the fashion historian, added that even when jacket-less, Obama's choice of shirts and ties is \"immaculate.\"\n\nMost people who we interviewed for this story thought Langone had gone too far in demonizing Obama.\n\n\"Reagan was a transformational president, but I don't really think the fact he wore a coat and tie to the Oval Office had anything to do with it,\" said Cannon, the Reagan biographer. \"And while I have my criticisms of President Obama, the notion that \u2018his behavior\u2019 means \u2018the end of America as we know it\u2019 is rot. Obama dresses appropriately for the present generation, as Reagan did for his.\"\n\nBruce Bartlett, an economist who worked in the Reagan White House, agreed that \"Reagan was certainly more formal than Carter, but probably no more so than Nixon or Ford had been. I don\u2019t have the impression that Obama is any different than most presidents in that regard. In any case, it is idiotic to say that he would be debasing the presidency by not wearing a jacket.\"\n\nSo where does this leave us? Langone isn\u2019t correct that Reagan \"would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on,\" since he did dress casually on weekend days. But it is true that Reagan consistently wore a jacket on weekdays. That\u2019s a stricter standard than Obama has set, though the differences between the two presidents aren\u2019t as divergent as Langone suggests.\n\nIn addition, most people we interviewed thought that he went too far when he used Obama\u2019s patterns of dress as evidence that he is \"unpresidential.\" Since the end of Obama\u2019s first 100 days, Obama has been photographed without a jacket in the Oval Office only about once every three months and never with a visitor who wasn\u2019t a senior staff member or appointee. The vast majority of photographs show Obama dressed in a jacket in the Oval Office, even though fashion experts agreed that generational norms have shifted, making jackets less essential, and less expected, in such settings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
