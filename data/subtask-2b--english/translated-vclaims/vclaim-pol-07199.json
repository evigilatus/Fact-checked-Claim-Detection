In a recent news release, Democrats said \"hospitals have already begun to lay off workers, as a direct result of Republican inaction.\" We considered the claim, which was made at the beginning of a special legislative session in mid-September, during which the Republicans refused to extend Medicaid &apos; s eligibility to up to 400,000 additional low-income and disabled Virgin Islanders. Under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act - also called \"Obamacker\" - Uncle Sam pays the full cost of expansion for two years and never less than 90 per cent in the future. Legislators who control the House of Representatives and the Senate have said that they have no confidence that the federal government will pay its promised share. Democrats have strongly supported this expansion, arguing, in part, that it will mitigate the losses suffered by hospitals from the treatment of needy patients. We have asked Morgan Finklestein, spokesman for the State Democratic Party, to substantiate the party's claim that the discharge of the hospital began as a direct result of the party's opposition to expansion. She sent us several articles and announcements about the discharge and closure of the hospital in Virginia over the past few years. Here is the list of discharges at 13 hospitals in Virginia: 50 in three health systems hospitals in Welmont State in South West Virginia in June 2013 140 through the closure of the Lolamont Regional Medical Centre in South West Virginia in October 2013 116 in the Mountain States Health Alliance, which includes hospitals in Tennessee State and South-West Virginia, on 33 January at the Winchester Health Center, mainly in the Winchester Medical Center, in January 66 in Mary Washington Health Care in Fridricksburg at the beginning of September. But it wasn't the only reason. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 20 January 2021, hospitals - most of them in rural areas - also blamed the decline in the number of patients and the decrease in medical care payments. The law reduces the reimbursement to hospitals for the treatment of medical care patients - the majority of whom are residents 65 and above. The Obamaker supporters believed that hospitals would recover most of the money by expanding Medicaid. But the equation changed in 2012 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the states could not be forced to expand their paramedic programs. This left a hole that allowed Virginia and 22 other states to resist expansion. A number of Virginia hospitals that were separated from work reported a 60 per cent increase in the population of medical care. Consequently, they were disproportionately affected by the lower amounts paid for medical care, while at the same time they were unable to benefit from additional funds in the medical assistance programme. For example, the Mountain Health Alliance in the Kingsport Times-News in Tennessee in January reported that the expansion of the Medicaid programme would help the system recover $20 million from its projected loss of $30 million annually. The Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg told Mary Washington that she expected $31 million to be lost in paying for medical care and that the expansion of the Medicaid programme would have compensated $14 million for the loss. In a news release on the closure of the Lee Regional Medical Centre, Izza Wilmont caused \"reimbursement reductions associated with the Affordable Care Act, the very low use of the hospital by the community and the lack of consistent medical coverage.\" It should be noted that rural hospitals throughout the country had financial problems long before Obama &apos; s care became part of our gazetteer, faced a reduction in the number of patients, and under pressure to shorten hospital stays. In a 2003 report, the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services found that 208 rural hospitals had been closed from 1990 to 2000. The report has not been updated. Eight of the 13 Virginia hospitals mentioned by the Democratic Party have been operating in red during each fiscal year since 2009, according to records of Virginia &apos; s health information. According to the Virginia Democratic Party, the discharge of hospitals began as a direct result of the refusal of Republican legislators to expand the Medicaid government program. Democrats refer to news bulletins from four hospital systems - mostly in rural areas - that have announced staff reductions since June 2013. The systems cited the resistance of the State to the expansion of the Medicaid programme as one of the many reasons for the layoffs. However, there was a greater impact in reducing reimbursement under the medical care programme under the Obama care programme. A number of hospital officials said that the expansion of the Medicaid programme would have allowed them to compensate for some - but not almost all - losses. It should also be noted that most of the individual hospitals where the discharges took place have been red since at least 2009 - some of them all but have lost their patient base. The refusal of the World Socialist Party to expand the Medicaid programme came at a difficult time for hospital systems, which certainly increased their plight. However, to say that demobilization is the \"direct result\" of the Republicans' work is an exaggerated claim that ignores deeper factors. The democratic claim is partially accurate but does not contain significant details. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07199"}
