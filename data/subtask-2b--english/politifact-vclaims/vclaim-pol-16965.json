And McGraw later said he offered \"bad examples.\"\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cigarette use is responsible for over 480,000 U.S. deaths per year, as McGraw said. The talk show host slightly overstated the number of deaths due to motor vehicle crashes, which the CDC reported as 40,231 in 2017.\nBut McGraw was wildly off when it came to deaths in swimming pools.\u00a0\nThe CDC tallied 3,709 deaths from accidental drowning or submersion in 2017, the most recent year with data available. Between 2005 and 2014, there were 3,536 unintentional deaths by drowning per year on average, plus an additional 332 from drowning in boat-related incidents.\u00a0\nNot all drownings occur in swimming pools. According to the CDC, more than half of fatal and nonfatal drownings among people 15 years and older occur in natural water, such as lakes or the ocean. Drowning can also occur in bathtubs.\nIn an April 17 video on Facebook and Instagram Live, McGraw said he \"misspoke\" about drowning deaths. He said he was citing the worldwide number, which is 320,000 deaths per year, according to the World Health Organization.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s still 40,000 fewer deaths than what he originally said. And the problems go beyond the number.\nAs we\u2019ve reported, comparisons like McGraw\u2019s can be misleading. The coronavirus, which had led to roughly 34,000 U.S. deaths as of April 17, is infectious and contagious. Drowning is not.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED: Understanding the scale of potential coronavirus deaths\nMcGraw\u2019s comparison ignores that other, more predictable causes of death are \"spread out throughout the year, and we\u2019ve built up the capacity to manage them,\" said Arthur Caplan, the founding head of the division of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine.\n\"That comparison is ridiculous, ill-grounded, and actually dangerous,\" Caplan said. \"The issue isn\u2019t how many people die of car crashes or swimming pool accidents or strokes or whatever. The question is whether they all happen at once and overwhelm the health care system.\"\nRELATED: Hannity wrong that health care system is ready as is for coronavirus\nOther experts have told us comparisons like McGraw\u2019s also downplay the coronavirus\u2019 risk of exponential spread \u2014 and the importance of mitigation efforts in reducing that risk.\u00a0\nThe Imperial College of London estimated in mid March that if the U.S. did absolutely nothing to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the country could see as many as 2.2 million deaths \u2014 a number President Donald Trump has pointed to as proof that his efforts have been successful.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has called comparisons between the coronavirus and traffic accidents a \"false equivalency,\" noting that the coronavirus \"is emerging, and you really can\u2019t predict totally the impact it\u2019s going to have.\"\u00a0\nMcGraw acknowledged that the comparison wasn\u2019t perfect on Facebook and Instagram Live. A spokesperson for the \"Dr. Phil\" TV show pointed us to those remarks when we asked for a comment.\n\"Last night, I said we as a society have chosen to live with certain controllable deadly risks everyday \u2014 smoking, auto crashes, swimming,\" he said. \"And yes, I know that those are not contagious, so probably bad examples, probably bad examples.\"\nOur ruling\nMcGraw said there are \"360,000 (deaths) a year from swimming pools, but we don\u2019t shut the country down for that.\"\nFor one thing, that\u2019s too many zeros. There were 3,709 U.S. deaths from accidental drowning or submersion in 2017.\u00a0\nMcGraw has since said he was citing the worldwide number for drowning deaths, and that his comparisons were \"probably bad examples.\" The coronavirus is infectious and contagious, and the count of deaths from drowning is spread over a year.\u00a0\nWe rate his original statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16965"}
