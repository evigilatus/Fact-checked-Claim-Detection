This isn\u2019t one of them. The story is fake.\n\"Tampa man loses testicles after trying to 'fill scuba tank with weed smoke',\" read the headline on an April 13, 2017, article on FloridaSunPost.com. The story was flagged by Facebook users who suspected the story may be fake, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to curtail fake news.\nThe story said a Tampa man named Darren Winters \"had consumed a copious amount of alcohol\" when he decided to invite friends over to witness him use a contraption he dubbed a \"scuba bong.\"\nThe recreational diver had planned to blow smoke into a scuba tank with a compressor, then inhale it through a regulator, the story read. Winters reportedly knocked the tank off a workbench and it exploded, with shrapnel severing his genitals.\nWhile those details are graphic, they\u2019re also completely fabricated.
