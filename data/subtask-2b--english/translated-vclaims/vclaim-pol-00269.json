It's better to find everything you can on it so I can send it to other people so it doesn't work. Mrs. Bird looks just like Destroy her, said Bayer. We had to know whether Beer's description of the Texas icon Ms. Baird Johnson was accurate. The central comedy did not respond to a request for further information, so we reviewed the news coverage of the archives and talked to historians to verify this allegation. First, let's identify the scene Kate was one of the 50 women invited to the White House on January 18, 1968, for a \"working woman's luncheon\" to discuss crime among young people, according to the New York Times story of January 19, 1968. Johnson often recorded her thoughts and implications throughout her husband's presidency of Lyndon Johnson, according to the Presidential Library and Museum of LBJ. A copy of January 18, 1968 records the details of lunch day. Other women attending the meeting included wives of governors, wives of senators, journalists and members of the National Emergency Committee of the National Council on Crime and Misdemeanour, according to Johnson &apos; s audio notes. Both President Lyndon Johnson and First Lady were at lunch. When Kate came up to talk, she offered a severe condemnation of the Vietnam War, according to The New York Times. In her audio memoirs, Ms. Baird Johnson said that Kate took a step towards her, \"a look with a sharp orientation in my face,\" when she offered to criticize her. \"You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed,\" said Kate during lunch, according to the Times. \"They rebel in the street. They're gonna take the weed and they're gonna get high. They don't want to go to school because they're gonna kidnap their mothers to shoot them in Vietnam. Johnson said that Kate's speech stunned the room to silence. Kitt's reaction at the time was not the only entertainment symbol to criticize Johnson's administration for Vietnam's war. Michael Gillette, a former historian at the LBJ presidential library, told journalist Walter Cronket and actress Jane Fonda were among the public figures who spoke against the war. Kate &apos; s comments were well documented in the press because they caused great noise. An anonymous letter to the First Lady on January 22, 1968 contained a racist language about Kate and said that she \"beat the White House and make us all ashamed.\" A woman named Clarence Noak left a message to Johnson on January 20, 1968 to say that she was proud of her son to volunteer to serve in the war, where he was killed. In a letter from January 1968 to Johnson, Warren E. Berger, then a federal appeal judge who will be appointed a year later to the United States Supreme Court, said that he and his wife were proud of how they formed themselves during lunch. \"The unhappy episode of your lunch lately prompts me to write to tell you that Mrs. Berger and I deeply cherish the courage and reassurance shown in the face of a flagrant breach of your hospitality and good elementary manners,\" said Berger. Marco Rubio was mentioned on January 22, 2021 in a tweet by Joe Biden, \"He has issued more executive tweets than anyone else in such a short period of time, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone else.\" According to an article issued on January 23, 1968, Kate told the Times that she had received telegrams, telephone calls and mail from supporters who had agreed to what she had said. Kate later on June 7, 2006, a video interview said she didn't realize that the disaster in the White House affected her career until investigative reporter Seymour Hirsch contacted her about the CIA file about her. \"I didn't realize I was being rejected in the United States and I couldn't find a job. I thought maybe my people were waning up, my sales of records weren't okay, \"Kate said. He said Johnson asked the CIA to find harmful information about Kate after lunch. We have not been able to find evidence of this direct request. But the Secret Service requested information about Kate from the CIA the day after the women's luncheon, according to Hersh's January 3, 1975 story in The Times. According to historians, it is not clear who directed the secret service to make the application. The secret service officials said they asked the CIA for information about Kate to see whether she was a threat to President Johnson or others under their protection, according to the Times. The CIA gave a three-page report on Kate to the Security Service, a file maintained by the Agency since 1956 at least, because, according to The Times, Kate had done work abroad. The report stated that Kate had \"very bad behavior\" and described her as \"a spoiled, very rude child with a mean tongue.\" We have submitted a request for records open to the CIA to search for the information contained in the report. The CIA replied: \"We did not find any responsive records that would reveal a publicly recognized CIA connection with this subject.\" John Wilson, an archive officer at the LBJ presidential library, said he suspected Mrs. Bird Johnson had asked the CIA to investigate the star, and if she did, she wouldn't have put it in writing. \"As strong as it is, the first ladies don't have much, but people tend to listen, I think,\" said Wilson. \"whether or not she should or could ask is one thing, but if she asks them informally, it would be much more likely to pay attention.\" Jillette said Johnson wouldn't want to start a fire about Kate's accident. \"I knew her a long time ago, and I knew a lot of people who knew her more than I did, and that from outside her character she was almost funny,\" said Gillette. Our judgment \"History of drunkenness\" claimed by former First Lady Bird Johnson asked the CIA to find damn information about Irtha Kate. While the Secret Service requested information from the CIA after lunch, there is no evidence to support the idea that Ms. Bird Johnson requested information. The Secret Service said the order was made for security purposes, not for destruction. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00269"}
