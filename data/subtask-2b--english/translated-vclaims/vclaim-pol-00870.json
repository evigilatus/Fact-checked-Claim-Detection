Anyway, some social media that spread the Internet say that Yosemite Sam was \"stopped\" from appearing on the airwaves because he was so violent. One of these articles, shared on 18 March, presents a picture of Sam Yosemite in front of the Confederate flag with his two drawers, and says, \"I have been banned from television for being so violent. You see me on TV, you have a gun, and you don't shoot or kill anyone!\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no documented evidence, or any previous or current media reports that Yosemite has been banned or severed from the presentation for any reason. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 16 January 2021, the only person who was temporarily banned by Lonnie Tones was Speedy Gonz\u00e1lez, a small Mexican mouse considered to be a degrading model, reportedly withdrawn from the air in late 1999. But Speedy's fans gathered to get the character back on TV. The rat's moving pants returned in 2002. Ten episodes of \"Merri Milodies\" (the series of Lonnie Tones sisters also produced by Warner Bruce.) and one part of Lonnie Tones called \"Angel Boss,\" all pulled out of the radiance in the 1960s because of racist content. The Bible of Boss, released in 1944, filmed a young boy wearing a black face. These cartoons are sometimes referred to as \"Eleventh Control,\" none of which includes Yosemite Sam. In the meantime, you can still see Lonnie Tones rebroadcast on TV today. In Pomerang, a cable television network and broadcast service owned by Warner Bruce, you can broadcast the show and pick up the characters of the program, including Yosemite, at 10 a.m. on a week. Our social media article claims that Lonnie Tones, Yosemite Sam, was denied access to television because he was very violent. There is no evidence that the parts of Yosemite were banned at any time. We can still find the red beard cowboy on TV today. This article is wrong.
