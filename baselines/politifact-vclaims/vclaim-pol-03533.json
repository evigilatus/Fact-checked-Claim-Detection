When asked in a press conference about the impact on students in Pennsylvania, Mulvaney couched his answer as pertaining to \"after-school programs generally.\"\n\"They're supposed to be educational programs, right,\" he said March 16. \"That's what they're supposed to do, they're supposed to help kids who can't -- who don't get fed at home, get fed so that they do better at school. Guess what? There's no demonstrable evidence they're actually doing that. There's no demonstrable evidence they're actually helping results, helping kids do better at school.\"\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s budget zeros out the $1.2 billion for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program that helps fund after-school and summer programs in disadvantaged communities around the country.\nWe wondered what the research shows. Is there evidence programs like this help academically?\nThe answer is a qualified yes. Improvements in test scores can be modest, and results vary from place to place. Also, as you might expect, the kids who actually come every day do better than those who don\u2019t.\nCalifornia commissioned the UCLA Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing to do a detailed analysis of that state\u2019s program. The center\u2019s 2012 report found that among high school students \"participation had a slightly positive but minor effect on English language arts and math California Standards Test scores.\"\nHow minor? Students who took advantage of the afterschool program on average had scores a few points higher than a control group (matched according to a number of characteristics). Researchers called the results statistically significant but \"substantively weak.\"\nFor younger children, from kindergarten through eighth grade, the center\u2019s research found the program boosted test scores only for the students who came regularly. For those who rarely showed up, there was no benefit.\nDeborah La Torre, a research associate at the UCLA center, told us food is an incidental part of these programs, and she called Mulvaney\u2019s description \"muddled.\" In California, the kids must get a \"healthy snack.\"\n\"None of the programs just provide food,\" La Torre said. \"That\u2019s not what they are about. They are mandated to provide specific academic programs in math and English, to help with homework and offer other programs such as art or physical fitness.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Texas Education Agency also brought in an outside group to assess its federally funded afterschool program. Similarly to the California study, researchers found \"program participation was associated with higher Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills scores in reading/English language arts and mathematics.\"\nBut the benefits in Texas also mirrored California in that they were \"primarily in the small to moderate range.\"\nMulvaney\u2019s focus on food puzzled other experts in this field, including Ken Springer at Southern Methodist University\u2019s School of Education.\n\"Mr. Mulvaney's phrase \u2018doing better in school\u2019 leads somewhat narrowly to the question of whether better nutrition fosters better grades and test scores,\" Springer told us. \"It does, but when we focus specifically on better nutrition provided by afterschool programs, there's evidence that these programs can have other benefits, such as positively impacting students' knowledge about nutrition as well as their eating habits.\"\nSpringer said, and we confirmed, that there are many studies that affirm the educational benefits of feeding children from low-income families breakfast and lunch.\nEducation researchers also emphasize that test scores alone are not the only measure of impact. Reduced absenteeism and better odds of moving up to the next grade are also linked to afterschool programs.\nWe made several requests for information from the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. We did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nMulvaney said that there is no evidence that federally funded afterschool programs that feed students help\u00a0kids do better in school. Two studies from two of the largest states, California and Texas, found modest but positive impacts on test scores. They also found other gains, such as better attendance at school and better odds of moving up to the next grade.\nMulvaney made a strong assertion that there is no evidence of gains. There is, even if test scores only rise a little bit.
