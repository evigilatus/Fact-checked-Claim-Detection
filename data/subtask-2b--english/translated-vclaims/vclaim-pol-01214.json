This is said by the minority leader of the Senate of the Western State of Virginia, Roman Brizioso, who is democratic. \"Fifty percent of our budget (Western Virginia) was for lower education,\" said Brizioso during a panel discussion at the University of West Virginia in November 2018. We have considered the most recent budget report issued by the State to determine whether Brizusu is accurate. According to the latest West Virginia Executive Budget document, the State spent $1.919 billion on \"education\" in fiscal year 2017, the last year for which actual expenditure is currently available. (This category does not include university expenditure) Expenditures for \"higher education\" totalled $392.9 million. Total expenditures for fiscal year 2017 amounted to approximately $4.2 billion. This means that K-12 education accounts for about 46 per cent of the budget. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012. With regard to the recommendations for fiscal year 2011, expenditure on education will account for 44.26 per cent of total expenditure. After the meeting, Polyte Fact West Virginia asked Briceuso to clarify what he had meant, saying that the 50 per cent was approximate. In our judgment on the team, Brizioso said that \"50 percent of our budget (Western Virginia) was for low education.\" We found that it was 46 per cent for 2017 and 44 per cent recommended for 2019. Presio was suspended by a few percentage points, but he was on the field, so his statements were mostly correctly evaluated.
