They attribute this statement to the President: \"Don't miss,\" starting on October 17, \"They're not after me. They're after you, your weapons, your Christian values, your freedom. I'm just on their way.\" This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found several articles on MIM's website, but there are no reliable sources linking Trump to the statement. Nor did we find any coverage of Trump's footage in the Nexis news archive. Certainly, Trump accused liberals of assaulting Christian values. Facebook was published on February 7, 2021 in an article on Facebook, \"The Devil was diagnosed in the Super Bowl of Satan.\" By Bill McCarthy, 8 February 2021 \"In recent years, the hard left tried to camouflage Christian voices in their aggressive attack on freedom of expression,\" said in a speech at the top of the valuable voters on October 12. In the same speech, he also said: \"In every front, the extreme left is waging a war on the values shared by all in this Hall. They try to silence and punish the speech of Christians and religious believers of all religions.\" \"The serious danger facing historical Christian societies is unbelievable.\" What he didn't say was what's on Facebook. If there is evidence that Trump has made this statement, we will reconsider our assessment. Until then, we assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00019"}
