Nice!\"\nTrump was correct about the number. He omitted the fact, however, that few of these created substantive legislative change, as NPR reported. Fifteen of the bills \"reversed Obama-era rules and regulations. Others renamed federal buildings, provided for the creation of memorials or were related to personnel or government spending.\"\nSome Trump supporters, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Tulare, also have made problematic claims about the president\u2019s accomplishments.\nA reader suggested we fact-check this claim, made by Nunes on Fresno\u2019s KMJ radio, about Trump\u2019s bill signings:\n\"The news media hasn\u2019t covered this. But we have actually got more bills signed into law, more bills signed into law, this Congress working with this president, than any president previously before at this stage in the game,\" Nunes said on June 19, 2017, in an interview with host Ray Appleton.\nHe made this claim on Trump\u2019s 150th day in the White House. By that point, Trump had signed 39 bills into law, according to GovTrack.us, a legislative research and tracking website.\nNunes has gained additional attention in recent months, particularly for his actions as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\nIn April, he announced he was temporarily stepping away from leading that panel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He cited ethics complaints that he mishandled classified information.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that Nunes has stayed silent on Trump. In fact, he\u2019s continued to praise the president\u2019s actions.\nWe wondered whether the Nunes was right at the time he stated Trump had signed more bills \"than any president previously before at this stage in the game.\"\nOur research\nPolitiFact California and our national partner PolitiFact have checked related claims.\nIn April, shortly after Trump\u2019s 100th day in office, we rated as Mostly True California Rep. Tom McClintock\u2019s statement that \"President Trump has passed more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman.\"\nWe found Trump had indeed signed the most bills, 28, since Truman signed 55 during the first 100 days of his first full term. We clarified that, as of that time, none of the bills Trump had signed were major pieces of legislation.\nThat same month, PolitiFact rated False Trump\u2019s claim that \"no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days.\" It cited several presidential historians who said Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Truman and Barack Obama all accomplished more during their first 100 days in the White House.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\n\nstated on February 3, 2021 in a press conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what (QAnon) is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdated claim\nBut as we noted earlier, Nunes made his assertion on Trump\u2019s 150th day in office. He was specific about it, too, saying Trump had signed more bills than other presidents \"at this stage in the game.\"\nThat\u2019s simply not accurate, based on the research by GovTrack.us.\nNot only did Roosevelt and Truman sign more bills through 150 days, so did Presidents Jimmy Carter, 48, and Bill Clinton with 41. President George H. W. Bush signed the same number as Trump, 39.\n\"I think it\u2019s important that we all get the facts right,\" said Joshua Tauberer, founder of GovTrack.us. \"When Nunes made that statement, his numbers were 50 days out of date.\"\nCounting the number of bills signed is only one measure of a president\u2019s accomplishment, Tauberer added, and perhaps an arbitrary one at that.\n\"If you count pages or words, Obama signed more than twice as much legislation at this point than Trump. It just happens that the legislation that went to Obama was grouped into fewer distinct bills,\" he said.\nReporting by the Washington Post also shows Trump\u2019s bill signings fall short of other presidents\u2019 totals through 150 days.\nAsked about the claim, Nunes\u2019 spokesman Jack Langer told us the congressman \"was referring to it being the most bills signed in the first 100 days of a new administration since Truman.\" That would be accurate, if that\u2019s what Nunes said. But it\u2019s not.\nOf note, Trump has signed 36 executive orders, more than any president in recent history during his first 150 days, according to an analysis by the Washington Post. The orders do not require congressional approval.\nOur ruling\nCalifornia Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Tulare, said on Trump\u2019s 150th day in the White House that Trump had signed more bills into law \"than any president previously before at this stage in the game.\"\nResearch from GovTrack.us and reporting by news outlets show Trump\u2019s 39 bills signed into law trailed totals by Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Carter and Clinton. It tied him with President George H. W. Bush\u2019s total through this period.\nThe congressman\u2019s claim would have been accurate had he cited the correct timeframe (the 100 day mark in office) and context (since President Truman).\nInstead, he repeated an outdated talking point.\nWe rate\u00a0Nunes\u2019 statement False.\n\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2017-06-27 22:50:08 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  President Trump has signed more bills into law \u201cthan any president previously before at this stage in the game.\u201d     Devin Nunes California congressman    Monday, June 19, 2017 2017-06-19    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03165"}
