We need to know!EXAMINE ALL THE MACHINES!\u2014 Rep. Jody Hice (@CongressmanHice) December 4, 2020 \nHice\u2019s claim misleads on several fronts. He seems to be referring to the results of a hand recount in Ware County, which changed by 37 votes from the initial vote total.\nState election officials told us that the small difference between the initial count and the recount resulted from human error, not a failure of Dominion software.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for Hice\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nWare County Supervisor of Elections Carlos Nelson explained that the error occurred while a worker tabulated ballots. Absentee ballots are digitally scanned in batches of 100. If a scanning machine detects a ballot with a rip or a tear, the machine stops, forcing election workers to reject the batch, fix the torn ballot, and then resubmit the 100-vote batch for tabulation.\nIn this case, the worker accidentally submitted the same batch twice after a flawed ballot stopped the machine, once before the ballot was fixed and once after it was fixed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Nelson, Ware County election officials caught the error in an internal audit and quickly updated the result. The corrected numbers were affirmed during an electronic recount that the Trump campaign requested in Georgia.\u00a0\n\"The system worked as it was intended to work,\" said Nelson. \"We reported the error right after the election, updated all the numbers, and there was no issue for three weeks until the narrative changed.\"\nGabriel Sterling, a top Georgia election official, mirrored Nelson\u2019s claims, calling Hice\u2019s tweet \"flat-out misinformation\" in a tweet.\u00a0\nHice\u2019s claim appears to have originated in a Dec. 3 press release put out by the advocacy group Voter GA, which claims, without evidence, that the 37-vote-difference resulted from a Dominion Voting Machine, which \"flipped\" votes from Trump to Biden.\u00a0\nThe press release compares the discrepancy in the Ware County vote totals to Antrim County, Mich., where a clerk incorrectly tallied votes a day after the election. The mistake was quickly corrected, and there is no evidence that Antrim County\u2019s inaccurate vote count was caused by Dominion technology.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s unclear what forensic examination Hice was referencing. The Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office did conduct a forensic audit on a random sampling of Dominion voting machines, but that audit found \"no signs of cyber attacks or election hacking\" and \"no evidence of the machines being tampered.\"\nNelson said that he and his office had no trouble with Dominion technology and that numbers tabulated by those machines were \"spot on.\"\u00a0\nTrump won about 70% of the votes in Ware County.\nOur ruling\nHice said \"a forensics examination\" of a Ware County, Ga., Dominion Voting Systems machine found switched from Trump to Biden.\nThe 37-vote difference that election officials caught resulted from human error, not a flaw in Dominion software.\u00a0\nA forensic audit conducted by the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office on a random sampling of Dominion voting machines found \"no signs of cyber attacks or election hacking\" and \"no evidence of the machines being tampered.\"\u00a0\nWe rate this claim False.\u00a0\u200b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17259"}
