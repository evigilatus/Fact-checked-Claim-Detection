Antifa is an umbrella term for a movement of far-left, anti-fascists, and not a unified organization.\nNow, posts on Facebook claim that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said \"antifa are courageous Americans.\"\u00a0\nDid he really? The post says, \"Yes folks. He really said that.\"\n\n\u00a0\nNo, folks, he didn\u2019t.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The faux-quote appears to be linked to something Biden said in an April 2019 campaign video when he formally announced his candidacy.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden discussed the \"Unite the Right\" white nationalist rallies in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\u00a0\nBiden recapped the events, saying (around 1 minute in) that protesters were \"met by a courageous group of Americans.\" An image of a poster board that reads, \"VA students act against white supremacy,\" is displayed as Biden talks.\n\nIn context, Biden was broadly referring to people who opposed white nationalist demonstrators during those events. While anti-fascist counter-protesters fall under this designation, so do many others. Some of the counter-protesters were students, ministers from local churches, ordinary residents of Charlottesville, and racial justice advocates.\nGroups of antifa counter-protesters violently clashed with white nationalists at the Charlottesville rallies. Some witnesses said they incited the violence, which included people swinging sticks and clubs, throwing projectiles, spraying chemicals and getting into brawls. Each side blames the other for escalating the situation.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims that Biden said, \"Antifa are courageous Americans.\"\nBiden didn\u2019t say that. He spoke broadly about \"courageous\" people who stood up to white nationalists during the 2017 Charlottesville rallies, and didn\u2019t specifically call out, mention or praise antifa.\u00a0\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17932"}
