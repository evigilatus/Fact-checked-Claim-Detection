According to the video published by KXAS-TV, NBC5 in Fort Worth, Davis said on September 23, 2014: \"It is unacceptable that Greg Abbott and his replacement referred to women who were victims of rape or incest as if what they were facing in some way was a secondary issue. I invite them to disavow those statements and to show their respect for the women in this country who have been subjected to the crimes of rape and horrific incest and to show their respect for what they have put in them, for the trauma with which they have dealt and to move away from the idea that, in these circumstances, not those women who may be pregnant, they are somehow in a better place to know how women should deal with this situation.\" Davis, a senator in Fort Worth, has been asked whether Abbott should be responsible for commenting by someone he does not work for. She replied that the Republican Chancellor Matt McCoyak, who was questioning his comments, \"was an alternative voice to Greg Abbott and Greg Abbott's campaign. I think the most significant is the fact that Greg Abbott did not come forward to avoid Matt McCoyak's description of women who were victims of rape and incest as if somehow they had a minor problem.\" Makoyak (who has his own truth report card) was excluded from Davis' description of his comments and urged us to check whether he was a father or his \"competition,\" as Davis said, refers to victims of rape or incest as if they had been subjected to minor events. The issue is the emergence on 21 September 2014 of McCoyak, an episode of \"Lone Star Policy\" from the KXAS-TV program, during which he and Davis, the lawyer Matt Angel, presented a conflicting view on how Abbott, the State Attorney, and Davis succeeded in their first debate on 19 September 2014. On the show, reporter Grommer Jeffers asked Angel, \"Matt, do you think Wendy Davis chose any voters?\" \"Sure,\" Angel replied, saying that Abbott made it clear that he planned to continue defending the State against school districts who said that the funding system was unconstitutional. \"And also,\" Angel said, \"He has once again defended his position, his extreme attitude, that even in cases where women are victims of rape or incest, After that, Jeffers asked McCoyak if abortion was still a difficult problem for Davis in the state of Texas. McCoyak replied: \"That's right. Wendy Davis did not use the word \"abortion\" in her advertising speech when she announced that office, which is why. Look, Wendy Davis has banned a bill that would have denied him, and he did an illegal abortion after five months. This is the law of the country. Texas is a pro-life state. \"We can get into simple problems of 1 or 2% of the problem. But ultimately, Texas is a strong state in favour of life. I like Abbott to campaign on that issue only from now on, but Wendy knows that's not strategically wise. The angle: \"This is the first time I've heard rape or incest called a secondary issue.\" On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio says in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World you do not see the usual use of the trials of former leaders.\" An angle: \"The victim of rape and incest is not a simple problem.\" \"Okay, okay.\" Great. Yeah, right. On the day after Davis made this allegation, Makuiak sent us an e-mail statement stating that he was no substitute for Abbott and never claimed to have done so. \"I don't think rape or incest is a secondary issue and never said it,\" he told us. \"For any victim of rape or incest, this brutal crime is a major and life-changing issue, and the crime deserves to be tried to the fullest extent by law. Instead, I said that rape and incest are a small percentage of abortions.\" The spokesperson for the Abbott Amelia Shaci campaign told us by e-mail that Makwak was not hired or paid by the Abbott campaign. By e-mail for our inquiries, the spokesman for the Davis Zack Pittanas campaign said, \"Any Republican goes on TV to do a post-discussion tournament, Pitkanas said he wasn't aware of two other Abbott replacements presenting the rape rights that Davis described. Our verdict, Davis, said that Abbott and his surrogates referred to women who were victims of rape or incest as if what they were facing somehow was a minor matter. Davis misunderstands this because the person concerned, a Republican adviser who does not work for Abbott, immediately made it clear on the air that few abortions occur after rape or incest. Also on the air, McCoyk agreed with the Democrats who criticized him that rape and incest were not simple. Nor did Camp Davis identify any other persons who had declared incest and rape secondary, nor was there evidence that Abbott had said such a thing. Pants on fire! Pants on fire - The statement is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous allegation.
