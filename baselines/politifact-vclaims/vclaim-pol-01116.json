Then we go and see the coastal elite media trashing it for not being organic vegan. We\u2019re football players not bloggers. This was a perfect blue collar party.\"\nWe can\u2019t determine where the meme originated from but it has been shared widely on social media.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
