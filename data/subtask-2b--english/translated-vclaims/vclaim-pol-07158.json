The gay marriage supporters celebrated the movement. The opposition criticized this as further evidence that \"unelected judges\" had the power to override the will of the majority. The President of the Family Research Council, Tony Perkins, a leading group in the fight against gay marriage, said that the well-being of children was at the centre of the Council's position. \"We know from the social sciences that children are better with mother and father,\" said Perkins on October 12 on Sunday Fox News. We've examined this kind of allegation before. Independent research does not support Perkins' point of view. The Family Research Council has a web page containing 10 social science arguments against same-sex marriage. We have seen the list to find out who spoke of the well-being of children, and those points, which were based on studies that compared children in households of the same sex and two different sexes. Five out of ten children have more to do with marriage and society than with children. They have made allegations that marriage of two different sexes promotes the integration of men into the home, parental commitment, sexual fidelity, \"gender-based\" roles and the connection of marriage to reproduction. One sixth spoke of how children were conceived through artificial vaccination \"Junger\" to learn about their biological parents. While these questions undoubtedly occur, the book cited by the Family Research Council focused largely on what parents can do to raise children. It was more evidence of paternity, and less study compared to different types of households. In fact, it was never a peer-reviewed comparative study. The remaining four pieces of evidence leave four items on the Family Research Board's list. One asserted that children needed parents and referred to a study on households where the father was absent. However, this research looked at single-parent households, not children with same-sex parents, and therefore addressed an entirely different issue. The web page provides a natural point that children need mothers. It mentions books, not academic studies, and once again, books do not focus on comparing same-sex households and households of different sexes. It looks at gender differences and how children grow over time. The last two points of the Family Research Council deal with data on same-sex household children. You can find a lot of research that claims that growing up in same-sex families is not harmful. However, the Board cited written testimony from the Court to a professor at the University of Virginia who said that any of those studies \"had been conducted in accordance with generally accepted scientific research standards.\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2012, this certificate was given at two degrees: in 2001, research was carried out, and a series of studies were omitted. However, even if systemic criticisms were correct, they would not prove that growth in a family of the opposite sex was better. The Council then cited the work of the New York University sociologist Judith Stacey to illustrate the point that children growing up in same-sex families are \"more vulnerable to gender and sexual disorders.\" When we looked at this topic before, Stacey said this was \"a complete misuse of research.\" Stacy wrote that the differences she described, such as the fact that children were more open to same-sex relationships, should not be seen as shortcomings. Stacey accused the opponents of same-sex marriage of choosing her results. What other research shows is that we found one study funded by organizations to maintain that it shows that gay parents are worse than straight folks, but the American Society of Sociology, the University of Research itself and many well-known sociologists. In the course of the study, the searcher defined the same sex couples loosely, thus speaking only to two children who were already raised by homosexual parents. In contrast, we found several research projects comparing many more children in households of the same sex and two different sexes. A report was published in 2012 on 78 children - about half of whom were boys and half of whom were girls - raised by lesbian parents. The mothers have joined the research project since 1986, long before the birth of their children. The children were evaluated over time, and those results were matched with children of couples of both sexes. When asked how lesbian children felt about themselves and their relationships with their parents and peers, they responded as much as the children of straight parents. However, they are more likely to report harassment at school because of their parents. The American Psychological Association published a comprehensive review of studies conducted three decades ago. The most relevant section focuses on research comparing LGBT children. Studies have looked at children in terms of their school performance, their relationships with their peers, their intelligence, their self-esteem and a number of other variables. According to this review, \"the belief that children of lesbian and gay parents suffer from a disability in personal development has no empirical basis.\" Our rule, Perkins, said that based on social science, we know that children are better with a mother and a father. The research mentioned on the Perkins Group website, Family Research Council, does not provide any support. They rely on books rather than peer-reviewed research, selectively quote or mischaracterize the work they cite, or at best challenge the quality of the methodology on which results are based that are contrary to their position. On the contrary, we recently found peer-reviewed research in social sciences that found that the children of lesbian parents at least do so, as well as other children.
