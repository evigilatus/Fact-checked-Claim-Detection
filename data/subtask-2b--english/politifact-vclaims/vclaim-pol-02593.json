It will build no new lanes of freeways. If Californians didn\u2019t like their traffic before, they\u2019re going to like it even less when they\u2019re stuck in the exact same traffic and paying more for their gas.\"\nThe repeal campaign, led by Allen, is one of two efforts to eliminate the tax increase.\nOther Republicans have made similar claims.\n\"Practically none of the new money raised by the gas tax will build new lanes,\" Assemblyman Chad Mayes said in November 2017.\n\"There was no clear creation of more capacity,\" said John Cox, a San Diego businessman who is also running for governor and leads the other repeal effort, speaking at a forum in December. \u00a0Both repeal campaigns are working to qualify their initiatives for the November 2018 ballot.\nSince Allen\u2019s statement goes the furthest in claiming the tax increase builds no new lanes and won\u2019t ease traffic, we decided to hit the gas on a fact check.\nDid he get his facts right? And did he accurately frame the goals of the tax increase?\n\nFile photo / Capital Public Radio\nA tax to build new roads or repair them? \nThe gas tax increase is a key part of The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017. It was signed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown in April, with the goal of raising $52 billion over the next decade largely for road repairs.\nIt passed the Legislature and with a Democratic majority and the help of one Republican state senator. From the start, supporters pitched the measure as way to address California\u2019s massive road repair and maintenance backlog -- not to necessarily build bigger freeways as Allen and other Republicans have implied.\nDemocratic Sen. Jim Beall of San Jose introduced the legislation in December 2016 saying in a news release: \"Without action soon, our crumbling roads will severely affect California\u2019s economy,\u2019\u2019 while suggesting repairs could reduce commute times. Beall didn\u2019t mention anything about expanding freeways.\nThe package includes an initial 12 cent per gallon gasoline tax increase and a 20 cent per gallon diesel tax hike, both of which started on Nov. 1, 2017. It also includes a new \"transportation improvement fee\" ranging from $25 to $175 per year, depending on the value of one\u2019s vehicle. We wrote this summer about how the law will affect the state's already high gas tax rate and gas prices.\nIn common speech, some politicians simply call this whole package \"the gas tax.\"\nAllen\u2019s specific claims\nGiven the repair goals of the legislation, Allen\u2019s framing of the measure is misleading. But we also examined his specific assertions that it won\u2019t build new road lanes or ease traffic gridlock.\nWe found these are also problematic.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the new tax money, 65 percent, goes to repair projects. But 35 percent can be spent on \"expanded capacity,\" including highway and transit improvements, according to Mark Dinger, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation.\nThe biggest pot of money for those projects is the $250 million that will be available each year to improve congested corridors across the state. Dinger said that money can be used to make freeways more efficient by improving ramp meters and adding real-time electronic message boards showing precise travel times. Efficiency measures alone, he said, can improve traffic flow by 25 percent.\nDinger said the money can also pay for new freeway lanes, though he estimated those projects would not start until 2019 or 2020. State and regional agencies would need to submit applications for the money.\nType of new lanes limited\nHere\u2019s where Allen has a point: His spokeswoman pointed out that the congested corridor program can not fund general purpose freeway lanes, which are the main lanes used by most drivers. The legislation does, in fact, prohibit spending this money on those \"to mitigate increases in vehicle miles traveled, greenhouse gases, and air pollution,\" the text\u00a0of the law reads.\nStill, the measure does allow for spending on new carpool and toll lanes, plus auxiliary lanes which can ease the flow of traffic at backed up freeway interchanges.\nThe state\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office found the tax measure also pays for new local roads.\n\"The funding package includes about $1.8 billion annually specifically for local streets and roads,\" the LAO reported in June 2017. It specified that about $100 million annually would be set aside for \"capacity expansion,\" primarily on local roads and streets, though some could be used for transit projects.\nDinger said the tax measure, which also funds bicycle and pedestrian projects, reflects the state\u2019s more holistic approach to solving traffic.\n\"Just adding lanes is simply not the way out of traffic congestion. That\u2019s the old way of thinking in terms of transportation planning. You have to offer multi-modal choices and reduce people\u2019s dependency on their cars,\" the Caltrans spokesman said.\nOur ruling\nRepublican Assemblyman and candidate for governor Travis Allen claimed California\u2019s gas tax increase won\u2019t build new roads or freeway lanes nor will it ease traffic congestion.\nHis statement distorts the goal of the gas tax increase. Its purpose was to tackle the state\u2019s backlog of transportation repairs -- not to build bigger roads and highways.\nAllen also misses the mark on the details. It\u2019s correct to say one of the measure\u2019s big pots of money prohibits spending on general purpose freeway lanes.\nBut it allows funding for freeway carpool and toll lanes along with efficiency projects that can ease up bottlenecks. Additionally, the measure sets aside $100 million annually for the expansion of local roads.\nAllen\u2019s claim balances on a sliver of truth, but has a freeway full of problems.\nWe rate it Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013\u00a0The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\n Share the Facts 2017-12-15 06:23:14 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"This new gas tax does not increase (road) capacity anywhere in the state.
