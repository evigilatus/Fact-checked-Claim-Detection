That's right since Election Day -- $5.2 trillion. Think about that. That's a quarter of the $20 trillion that we owe. \u2026 In the last eight years of the previous administration, the debt doubled. \u2026 But since the election on Nov. 8, I've increased the value of your U.S. assets by more than the $20 trillion that we currently owe. You haven't heard those numbers.\"\nDuring a subsequent interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, Trump made the linkage between stock market gains and debt decreases even clearer.\n\"The country \u2014 we took it over and owed over 20 trillion. As you know the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up 5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value. So you could say, in one sense, we\u2019re really increasing values. And maybe in a sense we\u2019re reducing debt.\"\nWe decided to look into whether Trump had a point that the stock market gains on his watch effectively wiped out any of the debt incurred by his predecessor, Barack Obama. (The White House did not provide any further information to PolitiFact.)\nTrump is somewhat off-base with those numbers. But the bigger problem is that the stock market gains and the debt don\u2019t have the relationship he implies.\nWealth gains and federal debt are distinct\nAs of Oct. 12, the most expansive figure for the federal debt is almost $20.4 trillion. About $9.2 trillion of that came between the inaugurations of President Barack Obama and Trump. So that wasn\u2019t \"more than $10 trillion,\" and it wasn\u2019t double the cumulative debt when he took office.\nThe increase in stock market values may also be a little high. Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, told the Financial Post that the value has risen by about $4.4 trillion since the election.\nHowever, stock market gains accrue to stockholders; the government doesn\u2019t get any of those increases to pay for government spending or to pay down the debt unless and until the assets are sold and taxed. (Only a communist government can seize private assets to pay down the debt.)\nSo gaining a $5 trillion boost in stock values doesn\u2019t simply enable the country to write off that much of its $20 trillion debt.\n\"The president is conflating the stock market, which represents the wealth of private corporations, with the federal budget,\" said Chris Lafakis, director at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \"There is not a direct link between the two.\"\nThe taxation of such assets is delayed until the asset is sold, which could take years.\n\"At best, a small share of the increase in equity value will, some day, lead to higher capital gains taxes,\" said Steven Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis.\nAnd the rates at which such assets are taxed -- capital gains rates -- are relatively low compared to other forms of income taxes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With a tax rate on capital gains of 15 percent, even if all the stocks that have risen were sold tomorrow, the federal government would only reap at most 15 percent of the $5 trillion in asset gain,\" said added Bruce Bartlett, who served as deputy assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush.\nAnd some of these gains may never be taxed. That could be the case if the holdings are passed on to heirs in a modestly sized estate, or if they are held institutionally, such as by a university. Other gains may have accrued to pension funds, and taxes would only be paid when the pensions are paid out and taxed by the recipient.\nThe actual gain to the Treasury stemming from this stock run-up \"is completely out of whack\" with what Trump suggests, Lafakis said.\n\"We\u2019re talking about tens of billions, maybe even over $100 billion in extra revenues if you adopt very extreme assumptions,\" he said. \"That doesn\u2019t even stop our debt from going up, let alone pay down a meaningful portion of it.\"\nAll of this, of course, assumes that stock values, which fluctuate minute by minute, won\u2019t fall.\nSince Election Day, the Standard & Poor\u2019s index of U.S. stocks has risen by about 19 percent -- an impressive gain. But if we put this in context, other international stock markets have done even better.\nSpecifically, Germany\u2019s DAX has risen by 24 percent over the same period. France\u2019s CAC 40 and the Netherlands\u2019 AEX indexes have both risen by 20 percent. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index has risen by 22 percent, and both Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI have risen by 24 percent.\nAnother nuance Trump didn\u2019t capture: The lines between debt and wealth can be complicated.\nAbout one-third of the federal debt is held by foreign entities, but much of the rest is held by Americans -- and those federal bondholders count that \"debt\" on their own ledgers as \"wealth.\" Meanwhile, some fraction of the stocks that produced the equity gains Trump refers to are held by foreigners.\nUsing Trump\u2019s logic, Obama can claim credit for gains on his watch, too\nFrom Obama\u2019s inauguration through Oct. 12, 2009, the Standard & Poor\u2019s index increased by a whopping 34 percent, outpacing Trump\u2019s 19 percent over the same portion of his presidency. The circumstances were different, of course -- Obama started at an economic low point while Trump inherited a healthily growing economy -- but the economy went on to strengthen under Obama over the long term.\nBetween the first quarter of 2009 and the final quarter of 2016, Americans\u2019 net worth increased from $55 trillion to $92 trillion. (This figure encompasses stock market values, home and property values, and changes in the indebtedness of U.S. households.) That\u2019s an increase of two-thirds over eight years, or $37 trillion in raw dollars.\nSo under Obama, wealth increased by an amount four times as large as the increase in the federal debt. But, for the reasons we explained, the wealth gains could not be directly applied to reduce the debt.\n\"By President Trump's own reasoning, the Obama administration was an enormous success,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. \"The success has continued, so far, in the first nine months of the Trump administration.\"\nIn the meantime, some argue that the creation of certain types of debt under Obama -- the deficit-financed expenditures for the fiscal stimulus during the Great Recession, for instance -- helped produce the stock-price run-up under both Obama and Trump.\n\"One could argue that without the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the economy would have been far weaker in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and stock market valuations would have been lower,\" Lafakis said. \"So in that instance, increasing the debt helped the stock market.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said the Obama administration \"borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. ... Maybe in a sense we\u2019re reducing debt.\"\nTrump seems to be signaling that the stock market gains can somehow be applied to paying down the debt. That\u2019s not the case -- gains from a bull market accrue to stockholders, and the government doesn\u2019t get its fractional cut until the assets are sold and taxed, if they ever are. So, whatever tax revenues from the stock-market run-up eventually flow to the government over the course of many years won\u2019t make a dent in the debt, economists say.\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-12 21:08:28 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  The Obama administration \"borrowed more than $10 trillion, right?
