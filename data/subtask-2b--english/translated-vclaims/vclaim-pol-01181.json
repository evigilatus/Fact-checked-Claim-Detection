Jerry Brown claimed that?", "text": "(Democrat government) Jerry Brown received widespread praise for his ability to manage financial health in California. Brown inherited a budget deficit of $27 billion when its last governor began in 2011. Early on, spending was sharply cut, tax increases approved by voters were led and the economy recovered. Next month, the office will be left with a large surplus. But how much extra money is that? Brown claimed in a recent interview on NPR that it was \"up to $30 billion,\" after the interviewer mentioned $14 billion. Here's the full exchange: NPR: \"Today there's a surplus, with a rainy day box worth $14 billion. How much of that do you think was possible just because you have big majorities from your own party?\" Brown: \"The way we don't have a surplus of just $14 billion - a closed rain-day box at uncertain times in the future - we have a deficit that can currently be spent of $15 billion, and that surplus deficit. So yeah, there's a lot of money. We're talking closer to $30 billion.\" Was Brown right? Does California really have that much extra money? We've begun to verify the truth. We asked about this statement by a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance in Brown, who referred to a report issued in November by the non-partisan legislative analyst's office. It predicts State funding for the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1, 2019. This report, California budget projections 2019-20, expects the state \"Rene Day\" reserve fund to reach $14.5 billion by the end of the next fiscal year, which ends on 30 June 2020. The Brown Administration estimates that the Fund will reach $13.8 billion at the end of the current fiscal year, which expires on 30 June 2019. In addition to Rene Day's money, the LAO report predicts that the State will have $14.8 billion in \"estimated surplus,\" said Anne Hollingshead, a major financial and policy analyst in LAO. \"This is the money available free of charge to the legislature for allocation. So, either overspending or tax cuts, she said. In total, these amounts would amount to $29.3 billion, or \"almost $30 billion,\" as the Governor said. Hollingshead said that the Governor &apos; s statement represented a fair representation of the Office of Legal Evaluation &apos; s estimates. On January 12, 2021, in the speech, \"We put $330 million in public school aids - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, we asked two additional financial experts to assess the report of the office and the Governor's claim. The Brown statement on a surplus of $30 billion was generally correct. However, they noted that there are limits to how the various funds are used and that the State surplus is expected to be much smaller in the coming years owing to forecasts of an eventual economic slowdown. Given the Rainey Day box, it can only be spent in a financial emergency. It was established after the voters approved proposal 2 in 2014. \"I think if someone hears $30 billion, they might think, \"Oh, that's available for spending.\" In fact, not everything is available to spend on legislative or policy priorities,\" said Leonor Ehling, Executive Director of the California Studies Center in Sacramento, who previously worked on the State Council Budget Committee. Brown, in his exchange with NPR, presented some context around the Rene Day box, describing it as money \"closed at uncertain times in the future.\" Michael Ginst, who served as a republican government. The Director of Finance of Arnold Schwarzenegger also reviewed Brown &apos; s claim. \"Yeah, I think it's fair to say that there's about $30 billion between the actual reserve and the forecast of excess revenue on spending,\" said Jent in e-mail. \"He noted, however, that LAO showed that stagnation would eliminate those reserves very quickly.\" Holling Head, LAO Analyst, agreed. The estimated expenditure of $14.8 billion is \"one-time available.\" So it's only available for 2019-20,\" she said. This figure is expected to shrink to about $3 billion in the coming fiscal years. \"In the coming years, the budget will face challenges,\" says the LAO report. \"The most important threat to our expectations is the economy, which can slow down and result in billions of dollars of revenue losses per year. Decisions outside the control of the legislature, such as decisions taken by the federal Government or state pension systems, can also affect the State budget. The $15 billion surplus we expect for 2019, gives the legislature a unique opportunity to prepare for these and other unexpected challenges that are still coming.\" The next forecast of state funds will be published in January 2019, after the elected Governor, Gavin Newsome, is sworn in and his budget is released. Our government. In an interview with NPR, Jerry Brown claimed that California's budget surplus was \"up to $30 billion.\" A report by the Office of Non-Party Legislative Analysts expects the State to receive $14.5 billion in its Rene Day Reserve Fund by the end of next fiscal year. This would represent an increase over the $13.8 billion that the State expects to receive in that fund when the next fiscal year begins on 1 July 2019. The report also estimates that the legislature will receive $14.8 billion in estimated funds over the same period of time. Brown's description of the surplus \"almost $30 billion\" is generally correct, although it ignores the fact that this is the projection. Government finance experts pointed out that there were restrictions on Rene's money, a fact that Brown explained in the interview. They also note that California &apos; s surplus is expected to decrease in the coming years, with an economic slowdown expected. We found that Brown's statement was accurate but needed some clarification, most notably that the figure of $30 billion was a projection, not a certainty. We appreciate that Brown's statement is mostly true. In fact, this statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
