That is unacceptable. That must change.\"\nSanders\u2019 wealth claim, a favorite line from his stump speech, is largely accurate. \u00a0His claim about the uber wealthy hogging almost all of the new income, however, is out of date and exaggerated.\nA month before he launched his presidential campaign, Sanders made a version of the claim in an April 2015 interview with Fox News: \"99 percent of all new income today (is) going to the top 1 percent.\"\nBack then, we rated the claim Mostly True, as Sanders\u2019 figure was credible but not the only way to consider income inequality. (Some economists prefer to also factor in unemployment compensation, welfare and health benefits, Social Security, retirement income and health benefits.)\nAccording to University of California, Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, the top 1 percent captured 91 percent of pre-tax, pre-transfer income from 2009 to 2012.\nFor this fact-check, the Sanders campaign referred us to a study by the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute that concludes the top 1 percent got 85.1 percent of new income from 2009 to 2013.\nThe trouble for Sanders: A lot has happened since 2013. And as the economy has improved, the income disparity has lessened.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Sanders made the same point at a Democratic debate in February 2016, we found more recent data from Saez. By 2014, the top 1 percent\u2019s share of post-recession income dropped to a less egregious (albeit still disportionate) 58 percent \u2014 a figure that Sanders seems aware of.\nAnd last month, Saez updated his numbers again to include 2015 data, and the uber wealthy\u2019s share decreased slightly again to 52 percent.\n\"In 2014 and especially in 2015, the incomes of bottom 99 percent families have finally started recovering in earnest from the losses of the Great Recession,\" Saez writes, adding that the recovery now looks \"much less lopsided\" even as income inequality remains extremely high.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown:\n\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"The top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income.\"\nThat figure covers 2009 to 2013, but there\u2019s data for even more recent years. Factoring in 2014 and 2015, the top 1 percent\u2019s share in post-recession income falls to 52 percent. That\u2019s still a big number, but not nearly what Sanders told convention delegates and a large television audience.\nWe rate his claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04604"}
