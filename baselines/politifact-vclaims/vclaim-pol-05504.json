Clinton amassed extensive international experience during four years as President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state, but because of this, opponents can charge that she shoulders some of the blame for ongoing difficulties overseas.\nDuring a speech in Burlington, Iowa, on Jan. 20, 2016, Clinton argued that on foreign policy, she was the only candidate to offer a thorough, detailed vision for the future.\n\"We know one threat we have to face right now, and that's from ISIS,\" Clinton said, referring to the group also known as the Islamic State. \"And I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS.\"\n\nHillary Clinton addressing a crowd in Burlington, Iowa, on Jan. 20, 2016.\nClinton\u2019s claim didn\u2019t sound right to us because we\u2019ve heard many candidates describe how they would take on the terrorist group. In fact-checking her statement, we aren\u2019t taking a stance on the quality of her plan, or the other candidates\u2019 plans, only the degree to which a candidate has laid one out.\nOur research found that Clinton\u2019s plan is a bit lengthier and more detailed than the other ones we were able to locate. But she is hardly the only one to lay out a specific plan.\nThe following table provides a rundown of the Democratic and Republican campaigns for which we found either a candidate\u2019s speech addressing how to combat ISIS or an \"issues\" section of their campaign website that summarizes their views. If we found that the candidate offered both a speech and an issues Web page, we have analyzed the longer of the two.\nWe were unable to find a written proposal for every candidate, so the list does not cover the entire field. But putting Clinton\u2019s statement to the Truth-O-Meter only requires us to determine whether any candidate has laid out a \"specific plan.\"\nThe table shows the number of words in each candidate\u2019s ISIS proposal and our count of how many individual agenda items were included in each proposal.\n\n\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nParty\n\n\nSource\n\n\nWords in ISIS proposal\n\n\nIndividual agenda items\n\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\n\n\nDemocrat\n\n\nSpeech\n\n\n3,816\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\nJeb Bush\n\n\nRepublican\n\n\nSpeech\n\n\n3,195\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n\nDemocrat\n\n\nSpeech\n\n\n1,204\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

(You can scroll through them all here.)\nNotably, many of the points in Clinton\u2019s plan appear in at least one other candidate\u2019s plan, and often in several other candidates\u2019 plans. They include stronger intelligence, more intensive airstrikes, the use of ground forces, improved cooperation with allies, more effective restrictions on terrorist financing, and better efforts to counter ISIS recruiting on the Internet.\nFor instance, increased intelligence-sharing appears in plans not only from Clinton but also from Sanders, Rubio, Kasich and Fiorina. A greater role for Middle East allies was\u00a0mentioned not just by Clinton but in one form or another by Bush, Sanders, Rubio, Kasich, O'Malley, Carson and Fiorina.\nIndeed, of the 24 agenda points we isolated from Clinton\u2019s plan, we found just five that appeared to be only in her plan. They were passage of an updated authorization to use military force; curbing corruption among Middle East governments; securing loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons; improvements in airline-security techniques; and greater effort to ease the humanitarian crisis of refugees from the region.\nMeanwhile, elements of Rubio\u2019s plans were at least somewhat unique: \"engage in global ideological pushback by exposing ISIS\u2019s war crimes and sex trafficking and recruiting disaffected former members to tell their stories,\" and \"counter ISIS recruitment and propaganda by broadcasting U.S. victories, showing the world that ISIS is not invincible.\"\nBush, for his part, was the only candidate to specifically cite Canada\u2019s practice of embedding in Iraqi units as a model, since it is being done \"to a very good effect,\" Bush said.\nWhen we contacted Clinton\u2019s campaign for evidence, they pointed to several plaudits in the media for the comprehensiveness of her anti-ISIS plan. For instance, CNN reported that \"Michael Desch, an expert in international security at Notre Dame University, said that Clinton's speech was polished and showed her to be \u2018head and shoulders\u2019 above Republican candidates on framing an anti-ISIS strategy.\"\nAnd the New York Times\u2019 David Brooks wrote, \"While other candidates are content to issue vague calls to get tough on terror, Clinton offered a multilayered but coherent framework, not only dealing with ISIS but also putting that threat within the crosscutting conflicts that are inflaming the Middle East.\"\nHowever, Clinton\u2019s statement in Iowa wasn\u2019t about whether her plan was an effective one; it was that it was the only \"specific plan\" in the entire field of candidates. And that\u2019s clearly not the case.\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS.\"\nWhile Clinton\u2019s plan is more detailed, by some measurements, than those of other candidates, at least seven other candidates in both parties have released multi-point plans for taking on ISIS. Some plans -- such as those from Bush and Rubio -- approach Clinton\u2019s in either length or degree of detail. In fact, there\u2019s a significant degree of overlap between the agenda items in Clinton\u2019s plan and in plans released by other candidates.\nWe don\u2019t see strong evidence for Clinton\u2019s claim that she\u2019s the only member of the 2016 field with a \"specific plan.\" We rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05504"}
