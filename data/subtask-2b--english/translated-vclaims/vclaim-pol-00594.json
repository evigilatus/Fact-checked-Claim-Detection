Most of the 1 million green cards issued each year are based on a person &apos; s family connection in the United States. Now, Trump wants to turn this around so that most permits depend on skills and merit. \"Only 12% of legal immigrants are selected on the basis of skill or merit,\" said Tramp May 16. \"In countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and others, this figure is closer to 60, and in some cases up to 70 and 75%.\" We decided to check his international comparison. Figures are often verified by the United States, and are at least close to the other three countries. However, there is a need for context, and it is unclear which 75 per cent of countries he mentioned. The White House press office didn't answer our questions. The quick realities that we must bear in mind are that the size of the population in these four countries varies considerably. Estimated population for 2017: United States: 326 million Canada: 37 million Australia: 25 million New Zealand: 5 million Countries also use different terms, categories and standards for migration. For example, the term \"honour\" is not widely used outside the discussions in the United States and may suggest that migrants who obtain green cards through other means - such as refugees or family members of United States citizens - do not deserve this status. Migrants who obtain a green card through family ties or other routes may have professional degrees and other skills, even if that is not the basis for their acceptance. Family migration, as a share of their respective populations, is similar in Australia, Canada and the United States, according to studies. However, the rate of employment-based migration in the United States is much lower. Some 1.1 million people became permanent residents of the United States in fiscal year 2017. Some 138,000 people, or 12 per cent, have done so in an employment-based category. (Other categories include refugees and relatives of the United States). (Citizens) On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021, the employment-based category included multinational executive directors, skilled workers and professors. A small share of those green cards went to \"unskilled needy workers.\" More than half of the beneficiaries were spouses and children of the main applicants. In 2017, Canada accepted approximately 286,500 permanent residents; about 159,300, or 56 per cent, were in the category of economic class. This group includes caregivers, entrepreneurs and other skilled workers. The number reflects applicants and direct family members. Family members represent about half of the economic category in recent years, according to a non-partisan analysis carried out by the Institute for Migration Policy. Australia &apos; s immigration programme granted approximately 180,200 permanent residences in FY2016-17. About 124,000, or 68%, were called \"murder flow.\" He was less than half of the main applicants. Australia has traditionally granted some 207,200 permanent dwellings - including individuals granted residence under other programmes, including humanitarian ones. The \"skill flow\" category is about 60% of that 207,200.) The skill flow category includes skilled migrants who have tested points, entrepreneurs and workers sponsored by employers. New Zealand has agreed to the stay of approximately 48,000 people in FY2016-17. About 29,000, or 60%, were under \"skill/business.\" The category of business/skill in New Zealand includes entrepreneurs, persons with exceptional talents, technicians and commercial workers. The majority of approvals for the subcategory were skilled migrants, almost half of whom were major applicants. Data collection so that none of the other countries mentioned trump full access to work-based acceptance at 70% or 75%, as he said. But his main point is that the United States rate is much smaller. However, this does not mean that Canada and Australia are \"more brilliant\" in family migration, as Daniel Griswald, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, who studied these migration systems. It is a reflection of \"more open to labour-based migration.\" The Institute of Migration Policy also considered family migration policies in the United States, Canada and Australia (not New Zealand). If dependent family members who receive green cards within economic groups are reclassified as family migrants, the admission of family members becomes the largest group in Canada. \"while family migration analyses tend to focus narrowly on migrants registered as entering through family-sponsored channels, this is only part of the picture.\" \"The consideration of dependent migrants entering the country through other categories of visas more fully reveals the centrality of family migration in many countries.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"Only 12% of legal immigrants are selected on the basis of skill or merit. In countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and others, this figure is closer to 60, and in some cases up to 70 and 75%.\" In the United States, about 12 per cent of migrants have legal permanent residence based on work. In Canada, Australia and New Zealand, residence for similar categories of migration ranges from 56 per cent to 68 per cent. For all countries, these ratios include family members of professionals. If accompanying family members are reclassified as family migrants, the migration of the family in Canada is greater than the economic share, as mentioned in a study. Compared to the size of its population, the United States receives almost the same rate of family migrants as Canada and Australia. The Trump statement is accurate but needs clarification. We're mostly assessing it right. Sharing facts 2019-05-24 13:05:21 UTC PoliticsFact 5 1 7 PoliticsFacting: This real \"only 12% of legal immigrants are selected on the basis of skills or merit.
