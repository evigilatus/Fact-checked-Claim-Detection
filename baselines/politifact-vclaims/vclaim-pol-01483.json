It features silhouettes of a woman and a man facing each other. They take turns claiming that Walker\u2019s Democratic challenger, state schools superintendent Tony Evers, would raise taxes.\nBut there is a more conventional ad -- where Walker makes a similar, but more specific claim on Evers and taxes -- that we want to fact check.\nIn that spot, released Sept. 20, 2018, Walker begins by saying: \"With all the attack ads, it\u2019s easy to forget\" things in Wisconsin he likes to highlight, such as low unemployment and high-performing schools. Then Walker himself attacks, saying:\n\"Tony Evers? Well, he\u2019ll raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon.\"\nWalker has made claims like that in three more TV ads. What\u2019s more, similar claims are made in a TV ad from the Republican Governors Association/Right Direction Wisconsin PAC and in a TV ad from Americans for Prosperity.\nSo, what evidence does Walker have to back his political future-telling?\nIt\u2019s a mix: Evers is at least opening the door to higher property taxes; he said he will raise income taxes in at least one way; and he might raise the gas tax, but he says not by $1 per gallon.\nBut it\u2019s also important to note that, while Evers has said he is open to tax increases, it\u2019s not clear that he would raise all the taxes Walker says. And when it comes to property and income taxes, Evers has not expressed support for across-the-board increases.\n\n\n\n\nAll our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRaise Property taxes? Maybe\nEvers wants to raise limits on how much local school districts can levy in property taxes \u00a0\u2014 in other words, giving school districts the ability to increase property taxes.\nHe argues that because he also proposes increasing state aid to schools, among other factors, that will offset \u00a0\u2014 at least in the aggregate \u2014 the need for any property tax increase.\nOn the property tax side: Current law allows no per-pupil increase in local property taxes. Evers\u2019 2019-\u201921 budget request for his Department of Public Instruction calls for allowing school districts to increase local property taxes by $200 per-pupil in the first year of the budget and by $204 the second year.\nOn the state aid side: But Evers has also called for, as part of his budget proposal, increasing state payments to schools by $1.4 billion, or 10 percent, over two years. Evers has said he could increase the aid by making cuts elsewhere in the state budget.\nThe upshot, according to the Department of Public Instruction, is school districts with higher property wealth could their see property taxes go up, while less-wealthy districts could see property taxes go down.\nBut the department says there would be no net increase in property taxes collected. The department provided us figures indicating that increased state aid and other factors would offset any property taxes in total during the 2019-\u201921 budget period. A spokesman for the department told us Evers is committed after that, when revenue limits would rise with inflation, to continue to provide enough state aid to keep property taxes flat overall.\nIn any case, lifting the revenue limits at least opens the door to property tax increases.\n\n\n\n\nAll our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRaise income taxes? Yes, in at least one way\nBefore he secured the Democratic nomination, Evers said he wants to eliminate the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit, saying it favors the rich. His campaign has since repeated that Evers wants to eliminate the credit.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state\u2019s largest business lobby, supports the credit, saying it leads to business investment and job creation.\nThe credit, part of Walker\u2019s first state budget in 2011, gradually reduced the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses to nearly nothing -- from 7.9 percent to 0.4 percent. (In 2017, we rated Mostly True a claim that 11 people who each make over $30 million got a total of $22 million in credits from the tax credit.)\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Evers has said he is considering increasing income taxes on the wealthy and cutting income taxes for others \u2014 but adds: \"There\u2019s no definite plans at this time.\"\nSo, by eliminating one tax credit, Evers would be increasing income taxes on manufacturers and agricultural businesses; and he is open to raising income taxes on the wealthy, but lowering them on others.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook.

Maybe, but not up to $1 per gallon\nOn Aug. 15, 2018, the day after Evers won the primary election, Walker said Evers might be willing to quadruple the state\u2019s 32.9 cents-per-gallon state gas tax because Evers hasn't said how much he would be willing to increase it.\nLater that morning, a reporter asked Evers about Waker\u2019s comment and whether he would raise the gas tax by $1. Evers responded more generally by saying: \"I would support looking at anything, whether it\u2019s removing tax credits, whether it\u2019s slimming down state government, whether it\u2019s gas taxes. Everything is on the table.\"\n\nBut by the afternoon, Evers said Walker was lying about his views on the gas tax. \"The only thing I ever said about that,\" Evers declared, \"is that every possible revenue source is on the table.\" Evers has not said how much of an increase in the gas tax he could back.\nEvers has also said, in speaking about road funding, that he would consider increasing the gas tax or implementing tolls. He said he \"has no range\" in terms of how high of an increase in the gas tax he would consider.\nEvers also has said that while he is considering increasing the gas tax to pay for roads, a $1 increase was \"ridiculous.\"\nSo, saying Evers will raise gas taxes by up to $1 per gallon, when he has only said he would consider raising the tax some amount, goes too far.\nOur rating\nWalker says Evers will \"raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon.\"\nEvers has pledged to eliminate a Walker-era manufacturing and agriculture tax credit. So, that will result in higher income taxes for those who have taken advantage of the credit.\nOn property taxes, Evers acknowledges that his proposed budget for the state Department of Instruction could result in higher property taxes in some school districts and lower levies in others. By lifting revenue limits, however, Evers would be allowing school districts to increase property taxes.\nAnd while Evers has said he is open to raising the gas tax, he hasn\u2019t said he would seek any particular increase and has flatly denied that it would be $1.\nMoreover,\u00a0while Evers is open to raising taxes, it's not across-the-board, at least in the case of property and income taxes.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, we give Walker a Half True.
