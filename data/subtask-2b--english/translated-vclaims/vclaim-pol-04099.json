Heller was due to the desire to protect children from firearms. In the third presidential debate, Clinton stated that it supported the right of the individual to bear arms but did not agree with how the Court interpreted the second amendment because it did not accept \"reasonable regulations\" on the ownership of the weapon. \"What Colombia was trying to do was to protect children from weapons,\" said Clinton. There was much debate about how Clinton viewed the second amendment, but we were curious if it accurately described the rationale behind the issue. The Heller case itself was a challenge to the Firearms Control Regulations Act 1975, a broad decree issued by the City Council in Washington, D.C., which largely prohibited the population from possessing handguns, automatic weapons and unregistered firearms, as well as requiring that firearms held in a house be \"unloaded, disassembled, or tied to a trigger lock or a similar device.\" The prohibition of firearms and subsequent measures to control firearms on a large scale were considered to be more stringent rules on firearms ownership throughout the United States, although at that time members of the Capital Council said that it seemed to be the right thing to do. \"Armed crimes were just getting out of sight,\" said Sterling Tucker, president of the Capital Council when the ban was enacted. \"We had to isolate and contain the problem. We thought the gun code would do that.\" The order was issued in the mid-1970s and continued with several legal appeals until 2007, when the law was repealed by a federal court. This decision was upheld in Supreme Court decision 5.4 that the prohibition of hand-guns and \"stamp\" contained in the decree violated the second amendment. Before the Supreme Court &apos; s ruling, city leaders struggled to maintain the embargo, saying that its continued implementation had reduced the number of stolen firearms and firearms used in other crimes. In its appeal to the Supreme Court, the City Government filed a petition with the Court, in which it specifically referred to the risks to which children would be exposed if the ban on firearms was lifted. On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio says in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" The same petition also addressed the date of the ban, saying that the Council in 1976, which defined the existing law, did not adequately address armed violence, and specifically cited \"the very regularity with which pistols took the lives of children.\" However, child protection is not the only reason cited in the 30-page petition submitted by the city government - the city also addressed the general trends of violent crime and other legal arguments when it asked the Supreme Court to hear the case. The decision of the Heller court went beyond the mere repeal of the city &apos; s arms embargo, which for the first time widely affirmed the individual &apos; s right to own the private weapon. The Clinton campaign referred us to an arms control group that claims that the locking of guns and the laws preventing the arrival of children help prevent the accidental death of young children with a firearm. Previously, Polyte Fact\u00e9 was considering whether the city &apos; s ban on firearms had any impact on violent crime, finding that levels of violent crime varied from year to year and that other social and demographic factors played a greater role than firearms laws. Our referee, Clinton, said that her opposition to the 2008 Heller case was because \"What Columbia was trying to do was protect children from weapons.\" City leaders specifically referred to the risk to children in trying to maintain firearms regulations, but regulations also constitute a large-scale ban on unregistered weapons, not just firearms safety measures. The issue of child safety was not the only one referred to by defenders of the City Arms Control Ordinance, and the Heller decision dealt with a much broader issue than the protection of children from firearms deaths or injuries. We evaluate the statement half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a12779632-b0c9-4856-8bc2-c64555f9f78f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04099"}
