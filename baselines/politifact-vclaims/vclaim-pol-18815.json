More to come, but big win for the rule of law.\"\nHe\u2019s talking about guidance the Pennsylvania Department of State issued to county election officials on Wednesday instructing them to segregate ballots that arrive after 8 p.m. on Election Day. According to the guidance, these ballots will be processed separately. Nowhere in the guidance does it say the ballots won\u2019t be counted at all.\nPennsylvania law requires all ballots to be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. But citing United States Postal Service delays, the state Supreme Court last month extended the deadline for this election so ballots can be received by mail until 5 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 6, if they are either postmarked by Election Day or have missing or illegible postmarks.\nLast month, Pennsylvania Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block that decision, saying it violates the state legislature\u2019s constitutional right to set election rules. The justices split, 4-4, keeping the deadline extension intact.\nPerhaps hoping that Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the high court might yield a different outcome, the Pennsylvania Republican Party last Friday again asked the court to take up the issue and strike down the deadline extension. At the same time, a Republican congressional candidate sued in federal court to toss the extension.\nThe Supreme Court denied Republicans' request to expedite consideration of their second request for relief, but the case remains open. That means the justices could still take up the case and ultimately reverse the deadline extension, even after Election Day. The guidance the Pennsylvania Department of State issued is designed to help counties prepare for that possibility.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Counties were also instructed to keep a log of these ballots that includes the name and address of the voters who sent them, the date USPS delivered them, and details about any postmarks on the ballot envelopes.\nBarrett didn\u2019t participate in the decision not to expedite consideration of Republicans' latest request.\nRepublicans argue the state Supreme Court\u2019s deadline extension will allow mail ballots to be cast and counted after Election Day, a judicial overreach that steps on the state legislature\u2019s constitutional right to decide how elections are run. Several of the court\u2019s conservative justices appear willing to back that argument, with Justice Samuel Alito writing Wednesday that \"there is a strong likelihood that the state Supreme Court decision violates the federal constitution.\" Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch joined in that opinion.\nOur ruling\nTrump deputy campaign manager Justin Clark tweeted that Pennsylvania \"ballots received after Election Day will not be counted,\" citing guidance released on Wednesday by the Pennsylvania Department of State in a subsequent campaign email.\nThe guidance instructs counties to segregate ballots that arrive after 8 p.m. on Election Day but does not say those ballots won\u2019t be counted. The extended deadline for counting Pennsylvania ballots is under threat, but unless and until the U.S. Supreme Court takes action, ballots received by Nov. 6 at 5 p.m. will count.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18815"}
