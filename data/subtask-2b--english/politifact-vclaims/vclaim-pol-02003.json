But did the ad get its facts straight?\nHere\u2019s the full text of the TV spot:\nNarrator: \"As California Controller, John Chiang\u2019s job was to count the money. But the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion dollars. That\u2019s right. Billion with a \"B.\" And Chiang made tens of billions in accounting errors.\nWhat was John Chiang paying attention to? His special interest campaign contributors. The Sacramento Bee found Chiang gave millions in tax breaks to big developers who gave big money to John Chiang\u2019s campaign.\nJohn Chiang for Governor?\nDoesn\u2019t add up.\n\nThis is a screen shot from the ad. View the full ad by the Gavin Newsom for Governor campaign here.\u00a0\nIn this fact check, we focused on the ad\u2019s eye-popping claim: the state auditor found Chiang, who is now state treasurer, \"lost track of $31 billion.\"\nBackground on candidates\nNewsom is a Democrat, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor and a former mayor of San Francisco. He has consistently led in the polls in the race for governor \u2014 a late May survey showed him 13 percentage points ahead of second place Republican businessman John Cox. He was 26 points ahead of Chiang, who was next-to-last among the race\u2019s prominent candidates.\nRecently, Newsom said he\u2019d prefer to face a Republican in the November run-off, making his attacks on Democrats like Chiang appear to be part of his strategy.\nChiang has served as treasurer since January 2015. Before that, he was the state\u2019s controller, akin to the state\u2019s chief financial officer, for eight years.\nThe top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff.\nOur research \nAsked for evidence that \"the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion,\" Newsom\u2019s campaign pointed to a May 2014 news article by CBS13, a Sacramento TV station. It was headlined \"$31.65 Billion: California Accounting Errors Higher Than Combined GDP Of Jamaica, Iceland.\"\nThe CBS13 article refers to a scathing May 2014 report by the California State Auditor\u2019s Office that found deficiencies in the state\u2019s internal financial reporting practices. The mistakes ranged from understating liabilities, to miscalculating debt payments, to a data-entry error that added three extra zeros to a revenue figure, changing it from millions of dollars to billions.\n\"The number and magnitude of errors we found indicate the Controller\u2019s Office lacks a sufficient review process to prevent and detect significant errors,\" Deputy State Auditor John Collins concluded in the report, which was submitted to Gov. Jerry Brown and top state lawmakers.\nCollins did not respond to requests for an interview.\nStacking up $31 billion\nThe state audit and a 2014 Sacramento Bee article, which summarized the audit, were both referenced in the ad. The Bee article used a less sensational headline: Audit: State Controller\u2019s Office accounting riddled with errors, and had no mention of a $31 billion dollar figure.\nThe audit itself does not literally say Chiang \"lost track of $31 billion.\"\nThe ad, however, overlays \"$31 Billion\" in large, bold numerals at the top of an image of the auditor\u2019s report. The numbers even pop out at the viewer at one point.\nThat $31 billion figure comes from the TV station\u2019s article, which added up the dollar amounts of key mistakes cited in the audit.\nHere\u2019s how CBS13 arrived at $31 billion:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The audit revealed:\n-- $7.7 billion \u2013 Understated federal trust fund revenues and expenditures\n-- $653 million \u2013 Overstated general fund assets and revenues\n-- $8 billion \u2013 Overstated California State University\u2019s bond debt\n-- $9.1 billion \u2013 Reporting error that understated a public building construction fund\nAlso there was a deferred tax-revenue figure posted as $6.2 billion when it was actually $6.2 million.\nAll told, that\u2019s more than $31 billion in mistakes.\"\nWe checked and found all of those figures in the audit.\nMore to the story\nThere\u2019s some truth to the ad\u2019s claim, given the critical nature of the audit and the large dollar figure mistakes it found. But the use of the phrase \"lost track of $31 billion\" is somewhat questionable. It could leave the impression that Chiang\u2019s actions led to the state actually losing that money, which it did not.\nThe spot also omits the fact that Chiang\u2019s office acknowledged the problems and was taking steps to correct them.\n\"The (state controller\u2019s office) concurs with the California State Auditor\u2019s (CSAs) notation and believes that the challenges of high staff turnover and in recruiting qualified staff significantly contributed to the issues identified,\" the 2014 audit said. \"Other contributing factors included budget cuts and denial of financial resources, as well as poor quality and late submission of the financial data by numerous agencies.\"\nWhat did subsequent audits show? \nIn March 2015, the state auditor\u2019s office released another report that \"concludes that the State continues to experience certain deficiencies in its accounting and administrative practices that affect its internal controls over financial reporting.\"\nThat report blamed agencies such as the Department of Education for inaccurate financial reporting, though it did not directly criticize the controller\u2019s office. \u00a0\nSubsequent auditor reports show apparent improvement in Chiang\u2019s final years as treasurer and those immediately after.\nIn its March 2017 report, for example, the auditor\u2019s report \"did not identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies\" in financial reporting for the fiscal year that ended in June 2016. \u00a0\nResponse from Chiang\u2019s campaign \nChiang\u2019s campaign downplayed the significance of the 2014 audit report. They said a separate document, called a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, issued later that year was more reflective of the performance of the controller\u2019s office.\n\"Nobody is more a financial expert in the state than John,\" Chiang\u2019s campaign spokesman Fabien Levy said. \"Nobody is more obsessed with getting the numbers right.\"\nOur ruling\nA TV attack ad by Gavin Newsom\u2019s campaign for governor claims \"the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion dollars,\" when he was state controller.\nA 2014 state audit supports part of the claim. It criticized the state controller\u2019s office for understating billions of dollars in liabilities, miscalculating debt payments and making other errors.\nA TV news station added up some of the highest dollar figure mistakes and presented them as \"$31.65 billion in errors.\"\nThe state audit did not literally say the controller\u2019s office made \"$31 billion\" in mistakes, nor did it imply that the money was permanently lost under Chiang, but instead that his office made numerous accounting mistakes.\nThe ad also ignored that Chiang\u2019s office, according to the audit, acknowledged the mistakes, worked to fix them and blamed the errors on staffing shortages.\nNewsom\u2019s claim\u00a0is partially accurate. But it takes information in the audit out of context and ignores key details.\nWe rate it Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02003"}
