The evidence seemed to show a total of under $1 million for salary and other benefits. After publication, a spokesman for the group provided additional evidence showing Moore received compensation as a consultant and through an amended filing, bringing the total to more than $1 million. We have corrected our report, and we have changed the rating from Mostly False to Mostly True.\nAn attack ad targeting Roy Moore, a Republican candidate in the Alabama Senate special election, claims that he and his wife Kayla Moore paid themselves $1 million from a nonprofit organization they ran.\nThe ad, funded by the Senate Leadership Fund, also creates the impression Moore drew compensation from the organization, The Foundation for Moral Law, while sitting on the Alabama Supreme Court.\n\"Despite being one of the highest paid judges in the nation (...) Roy Moore wanted more,\" the advertisement said. \"So Roy Moore and his wife (paid themselves) over $1 million from a charity they ran.\"\nMoore will face Sen. Luther Strange in a Sept. 26 runoff vote for the Republican nomination to fill the senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. Strange, who\u2019s backed by the Senate Leadership Fund, was tapped to fill Sessions\u2019 seat ahead of the Dec. 12 general election. The Senate Leadership Fund is aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\nWe decided to investigate the Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s claim that the Moore family drew over $1 million from The Foundation for Moral Law.\nDid the Moore family draw a $1 million from a non-profit they ran?\nThe stated mission of The Foundation for Moral Law, founded in 2002, is to \"educate the public and promote current litigation aimed at moral and religious issues,\" according to its website.\nIn practice, the group writes friend-of-the-court briefs that advocate a Christian point of view in legal cases involving abortion, gay marriage, public prayer and other litigation with potential to \"restore the knowledge of God in law.\"\nThe group\u2019s ethos aligns with Moore\u2019s controversial judicial career, which includes being forced out as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003 for defying a federal court order to remove the Ten Commandments from the courthouse grounds. Moore was elected again to the Alabama Supreme Court in 2013 and was suspended in 2016 after he directed Alabama\u2019s probate judges to defy federal court orders on same-sex marriage. He resigned the following year.\nThe IRS granted The Foundation for Moral Law tax-exempt status in 2005, and that same year Moore was listed in IRS filings as the foundation\u2019s chairman. Moore served as either chairman or president from 2005 through 2012, and his wife Kayla Moore took over as president in 2013.\nThe attack ad claims it was during this 9-year period \u2014 from 2005 through 2013 \u2014 that the Moore family drew $1,030,875 in compensation (but as the screengrab shows, this time frame appears inconspicuously and in very fine print, perhaps to create the impression the Moores were paid in a single lump sum, when in fact their compensation was spread over nearly a decade).\n\nAs the breakdown below shows, the Moore family did in fact receive $1,030,875 from The Foundation for Moral Law over this period, according to IRS filings:\n\n\n\n\nForm 990\n\n\n\u201805\n\n\n\u201806\n\n\n\u201807\n\n\n\u201808\n\n\n\u201809\n\n\n\u201810\n\n\n\u201811\n\n\n\u201812\n\n\n\u201813\n\n\n\n\nRoy Moore\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9,983\n\n\n0\n\n\n105,500 (Legal consulting)\n\n\n55,392\n\n\n72,000 (Amended filing)\n\n\n90,000\n\n\n60,000 (Salary)\n\u00a0\n393,000 (Retirement and other deferred compensation)\n\n\n138,000\n\u00a0\n42,000\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nKayla Moore\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n65,000\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWas Moore paid by the foundation while serving on the Alabama Supreme Court?\nThe ad also creates the impression Moore drew compensation from The Foundation for Moral Law while serving as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, a position he began in 2001.\nMoore was kicked off the bench in 2003 for refusing to comply with a federal court order to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the rotunda of the state Supreme Court building.\nHe began to draw a salary from the foundation in 2005, two years after his dismissal from the bench, according to the foundation\u2019s IRS filings.
