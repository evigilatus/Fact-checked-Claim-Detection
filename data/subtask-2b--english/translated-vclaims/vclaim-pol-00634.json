The subsidies are in the form of vouchers known as scholarships for opportunities, a programme that provides up to $4,200 for families interested in sending their students to private schools. The state law currently limits vouchers to families earning approximately $63,000 annually. However, the Bill supported by the World Programme, which is 609 pesos, will raise the limit to families up to $70,000 a year. The Senate of the National Congress voted on May 8, 27 to 18, to approve the bill and send it to the House of Representatives - against the wishes of the Democrats who said that the State should not spend tax dollars on private schools. During the discussions, a couple of Democrats in the District of Mecklinburg proposed an expansion of the programme. Jeff Jackson said the order was low. In the meantime, Natasha Marcus said during a speech on the floor that there was a \"no waiting list\" of coupons. She said: \"As long as there is any waiting list, these parents make a lot of money to qualify.\" Jackson's claim is debatable. However, Marcus &apos; claim is misleading. 520 students in the current school year, 7,593 out of 8,113 eligible students received scholarships for opportunities. These 520 students were not rejected because their parents raised much money, as Marcus said. They were prevented from obtaining vouchers because of a ceiling that limits State spending on kindergartens and first-grade students, as mentioned in a previous fact check. Students from any class can receive vouchers. But the state \"can only give 40% of the money to kindergarten and first grade,\" said Catherine Marker, grant manager, training, and outreach at the Educational Aid in North Carolina. The so-called waiting list evaporates after each year. In other words, the 520 students who were excluded last year will not automatically be the first students in the class when the demand window opens this year. Therefore, technically, there is no waiting list at this moment. But Marcus is wrong to suggest that scholarships have been awarded to every eligible family. Marcus, who was contacted by Politi Vac, said that her comment had been made in the context of funding. \"I was referring to the fact that no child was denied a voucher due to lack of funding, as often with waiting lists before Ki,\" said Marcus in an e-mail. \"Arguments on the ground to defend this expansion seem to suggest that we need more funding to ease the waiting list.\" However, this distinction is not clear when reviewing its full comments during the May 8 debate. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook article Nancy Belusi, no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021, \"There is some talk about the waiting list and some suggestion that not every child wants a private school coupon able to get one and we need to expand,\" said Marcus during the discussion on May 8,. \"I want to be clear, as far as I know - and someone can correct me in this body if I'm wrong - every student applied for a coupon for a private school in this state, \"As much as there is any waiting list, these parents make a lot of money to qualify. Every eligible student has now received a voucher, and there is still $13 million in this box, and he was held hostage there for two years before returning to the General Fund. So, there's no waiting list.\" Before we ruled in Marcus' statement, we also wanted to reflect on Jackson's tweet. \"A few years ago, we started (other than) supporting private schools with coupons. It was limited to low-income families, \"Jackson tweeted. But the demand was low, so now they want to increase income viability. The word \"low\" can be somewhat subjective and difficult to define because the programme is only five years old. There are also restrictions on who may be eligible for vouchers, so the pool of potential beneficiaries is limited. However, in each year of its existence, the number of new applicants and recipients increased. \"It is clear that there is a constant interest. We feel that the programme is growing in a sustainable manner. Marker said it wasn't flat, it was growing. Jackson was called by Paulette Vack. He said that the unspent money was evidence of low demand, linked to expectations. He referred to the money left on the table, as stated by Charlotte and NC Policy Watch, a liberal advocacy group. Marker said that scholarship allocation data did not necessarily represent the total cost of the scholarship programme for opportunities. According to Marker, the remaining funds were: $2017-2018: $6.3 million 2016-2017: $2.7 million 2015-2016: $4.1 million 2014-2015: $5.8 million That doesn't tell the whole story. There is no waiting list in the sense that eligible applications exceed the request, while those who have not received a scholarship have been deported to the next year. However, more than 500 families were left without scholarships last year - although they were considered eligible - because of the imposition of a ceiling on kindergarten vouchers and first-grade students. Her claim is partially accurate but leaves important details or takes things out of context, so we evaluate it in half right. Correction: An earlier version of this story included inaccurate figures on the amount of scholarship funding for opportunities not spent in the fiscal years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. Change doesn't affect our judgment. Our evaluation of truth or meter stays the same.
