In a television commercial, Paxton accuses the Democratic Party of running a negative campaign - then going negative on Nelson's \"liberal agenda.\" \"The world's largest human trafficking market\" is closed. We were curious. Did the Texas prosecutor really do that? Jordan Perry, a consultant in the Paxton campaign, responded to our request for factual support by e-mail, referring to the links to the demand for closure in April 2018 of Packpage.com, a secret advertising site founded by Arizona-based partners in 2004 and particularly flourished through the publication of sex-focused advertisements, Pulitico referred to in the July 2018 story. Perry also referred to another Baxton TV commercial where the novelist says that Paxton \"help\" closed down the criminal project. The biggest market for trafficking? Trafficking in human beings, internal security says, \"involved in the use of force, fraud or coercion to obtain a type of work or commercial sex.\" We did not prove in the material presented by Perry that the Buck Page.com was \"the world's largest human trafficking market.\" More limited: United States Senate officials report 2017 that Perry indicated that the website is considered \"the leading online market for commercial sex.\" The report also states: \"The operation in 97 countries and 943 locations worldwide - the last estimated at more than half a billion dollars - is the second largest secret advertising site in the world. 73 per cent of all reports of child trafficking received by the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children from the general public (with the exception of reports received through the same background page) are on the back page. For our part, we were not sure how to determine whether the site was the largest market for human trafficking. Among the experts in the field of trafficking in persons, Laura Agust\u00edn, who studied immigrants and sex work, responded to our inquiry by e-mail saying that individuals had gone to advertisements on the back page for a variety of reasons. \"There is no \"market\" of Augustine books, \"but rather all kinds of people sell and buy sex for their own reasons, some miserable.\" Other experts told us that there is no research to support the biggest description of the Paxton trade market. Alexandra Levy, an assistant professor at the University of Notre Dame studying trafficking in persons, via e-mail, said that, as an experimental matter, you should study every \"human trafficking market\" for comparison. Levi also said, \"The general idea that the back page was a drain of sexual exploitation is unfounded. It was definitely a place where lawmakers found a lot of victims -- but this might just be because it was a particularly visible place, Levi wrote. :: Zollman from the Advanced Interactive Media Group, consultants in confidential advertising and interactive media, said by telephone that while there had been trafficking cases linked to advertisements posted on the back page, there was no evidence that the site was a major trafficking channel. Zollman predicted that if any web site led the world in human trafficking, it was a dark web site, and it was invisible to search engines. The world's largest trading market,com, said Zollman, calling the back page, is \"a clear fabrication.\" \u2219 Check Paxton's role. Did Paxton close the back page? His agency had a hand in closing, we confirmed it, but the federal government did it. Perry indicated that prior to the closure of the site and the company, Paxton established in 2016 a unit in the Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office to combat human trafficking. Subsequently, in October 2016, Paxton announced that Texas, in tandem with the California authorities, had arrested Carl Ferrer, CEO of Buckbedge. In a press release on the arrest of Ferreer, the Texas Public Prosecutor's Office stated that a joint investigation conducted by the Texas and California Public Defender's Offices \"undiscovered evidence that adult and child victims of sex trafficking were forced into prostitution through accompanying advertisements that have repeatedly appeared on the back page.\" The release also said: \"Almost 13 members of the Law Enforcement Unit of the Attorney General of Texas participated in the arrest of Ferrer and the execution of a search warrant at Dallas headquarters in Pakpaj, which is the largest announcer of adult escort services in the United States. On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio mentioned in his remarks \"only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" The letter states that the background page.com \"and its locations have been seized as part of an enforcement action by the FBI, United States. The Postal Inspection Service and the Internal Revenue Service. In the next section of the letter, the Texas Public Prosecutor's Office stated that the agencies involved in and supporting enforcement actions \"involving the United States Attorney's Office for Arizona, the Child Exploitation and Cruelty Section of the United States Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for Central California, the California Public Prosecutor's Office and the Texas Attorney's Office.\" The click on the same letter prompted us to issue a press release on April 9, 2018 at the Ministry of Justice entitled: \"The Justice Department is leading efforts to capture the back page.com, the leading Internet advertising forum for prostitution, and obtain a federal indictment of 93.\" According to the United States Attorney General, on April 6, 2018, the Department of Justice seized Pakpaj, which was \"the dominant market for illegal commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers often advertise children and adults.\" Now, sessions have said, \"It can no longer be used by criminals to promote and facilitate human trafficking.\" The release is closed: \"led by the Child Exploitation and Cruelty Section of the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney General's Office for the Arizona Region, with significant support from the United States Attorney's Office for the Central California Region, the California Attorney's Office and the Texas Attorney's Office.\" Levi, Notre Dame's expert, told us separately: \"Paxton didn't close the back page -- the federal government did.\" When the background page was closed.com, the relevant federal law, article 230 of the Safety of Communications Act, generally did not give state prosecutors \"the power to prosecute platforms (e.g. the back page) for third party content,\" although Congress subsequently amended the law, Levi wrote. To sum up, Levi Texas AG said, \"In no way can it be reliably considered the main port\" on the back page.com. What role, Texas? If Texas did not close the back page alone, we asked: What role do you play? We confirmed that Paxton focused on the company years before the closure. In a press release issued in October 2016, the spokesman for the Texas Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office, Kaylie Loveforn, referred to us, stating that Paxton had been detained under an arrest warrant issued by California after arriving in Houston on a plane from abroad. \"Long joint investigation\" by the Attorney General's Office in Texas and California \"uncovered evidence that adult and child victims of sex trafficking were forced into prostitution,\" said release, \"through escort announcements\" in Pakpij.com. The release of some 36 AG staff members who participated in the arrest of Ferrer and in the execution of a search warrant at Dallas headquarters in Pakpaj, \"which is the largest advertiser of adult escort services in the United States,\" said the release. At that time, Associated Press reported that Ferrer had agreed to hand him over from Texas to California to face charges of sex trafficking and money laundering. As mentioned in the story, citing a sworn statement by the Texas Attorney General's Office to obtain a search warrant, the Internet portal received over 90 percent of its revenue from adult escorts doing part of the secret advertising work. The story says Ferreer \"said directly by law enforcement officials for on-site prostitution, and, according to Texas testimony, \"is regularly copied on hundreds of law enforcement subpoenas and requests that Bakbaj.com receive every year in connection with prostitution and sexual trafficking of both adults and minors on the website,\" and he said the story. According to the California authorities, the three-year state investigation found that many advertisements included victims of sex trafficking, including children under 18 years of age, as the story says. \u2219 Guilty plea deal from Perry, we carried out what he described as files proving that the case led by the Texas State Prosecutor's Office led to Ferrer's agreement to close the back page. The documents were filed on April 9, 2018 in the Noiss District Court - three days after the authorities closed the back page, although the hearings on the same day declared the closure. It includes the \"Blea Negotiating Agreement,\" in which Ferrer agreed to take immediate steps to permanently close the Buckbag page.com at the global level. Ferrer also pleaded guilty to money-laundering and granted \"use immunity\" and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in Texas and California. According to another document submitted to the court, Ferrer pleaded guilty to being trafficked and to involvement in organized criminal activity in what the document described as acts involving a minor who was forced to have sex in relation to Buckbag.com. We asked Levi to review the documents submitted. Did they show that Paxton led multi-government efforts to close the back page? Levi said no, he writes: \"The feds have already taken over the back page at the time those appeals were signed.\" The governor, Paxton, says, \"He shut down the world's largest human trafficking market.\" We see one element of the truth in this allegation: the Prosecutor's Office in Texas helped close the backpage site, as the other Paxton Declaration says. In any case, the federal government has led the closure and officials in other states have entered. It is also important that we have not reached any confirmation that the background page, which benefited from sex advertisements, was also the world &apos; s largest market for trafficking - a classification that experts found questionable and unverifiable. All that has been said, we appreciate this statement often wrong. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
