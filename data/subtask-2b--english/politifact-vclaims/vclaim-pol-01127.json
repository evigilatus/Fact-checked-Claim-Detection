Here\u2019s why", "text": "Senate Democrats are expected to force a vote to block the Trump administration from lifting sanctions on three companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.\nThe sanctions relief requires the Russian billionaire, who has ties to President Vladimir Putin, to divest himself of large corporate ownership stakes, including a controlling interest in the world\u2019s second largest aluminium production company, Rusal.\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat, expressed skepticism about the administration's proposal during an appearance on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to force a vote against the sanctions relief shortly. \u00a0\nWarner said the Treasury Department has \"a scheme to try to take (Deripaska\u2019s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45\" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions. But he doubted the arrangement would curb Deripaska\u2019s influence.\n\"As more and more of this information comes out about ties between Trump and Trump officials and the Russians,\" Warner said, \"it is the worst time to signal that we're going to take the pressure off of oligarchs like Deripaska.\"\nWarner\u2019s partial description of the Treasury Department\u2019s deal with Deripaska is right, but it leaves out important details. Furthermore, several experts we spoke to had a different read of the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s reasons for wanting the sanctions lifted. We asked Warner's office for comment, but didn't hear back.\u00a0\nPunishing Russia\nWarner was right about some of the mechanics of the Treasury Department\u2019s deal with Deripaska.\nHere\u2019s the quick backstory on the sanctions. Last April, the Treasury Department placed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska, as well as a dozen companies the oligarchs either owned or controlled.\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC \u2014 the Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions arm \u2014 said in a report that \"the action aggressively targeted Russian oligarchs and elites that further the Kremlin's global malign activities.\" The misbehavior included \"attempts to subvert Western democracy, support for the (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad regime, malicious cyber activities, occupation of Crimea, and instigation of violence in Ukraine.\"\nAmong the dozen sanctioned companies were three that were connected to Deripaska, who the Treasury Department referred to as \"a Kremlin insider.\" Deripaska held a 70 percent ownership stake in EN+, the holding company for the aluminum powerhouse Rusal, and energy company ESE.\nThe department agreed to lift sanctions on the three companies in exchange for Deripaska\u2019s ownership stake in EN+ dropping from 70 to 44.95 percent. Doing so clears a key threshold. With Deripaska no longer the majority owner, the company becomes eligible to have sanctions lifted under the Treasury Department\u2019s \"50-percent rule,\" a process known as delisting.\nBut the deal tacks on additional conditions that Warner didn\u2019t mention. It includes a corporate restructuring, designed to limit Deripaska\u2019s (and Kremlin) influence over the companies, plus additional reporting and transparency requirements. \u00a0\nUnless lawmakers block it, the sanctions are due to be lifted very soon, by Jan. 18. While this would relieve some of the economic pain inflicted on Deripaska\u2019s companies, it\u2019s worth noting that the sanctions on Deripaska personally would remain in effect.\n\"Deripaska won't see a penny of the income from the shares until he himself is delisted \u2014 and that is not in the cards with this divestiture deal,\" said Samantha Sultoon, a visiting senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the foreign policy experts we talked to \u2014 though not all \u2014 shared Warner\u2019s skepticism that the corporate reshuffling plan would keep Deripaska in check.\n\"Given how business is done by influential, Kremlin-connected oligarchs in Russia, I have no question that if Deripaska wants to be in control, he will be,\" said Joseph DeThomas, a former high-ranking State Department official who teaches international affairs at Penn State University.\nCoziness or clumsiness?\nWarner is among a group of Democrats who have raised questions about the Trump administration\u2019s motives for granting sanctions relief to the Deripaska-linked companies, which they see as helping out a Putin crony.\nHowever, most experts we spoke to said this is a case of the Trump administration\u2019s clumsiness, not coziness.\nBack in April, when the sanctions hit the aluminum giant Rusal, it sent shockwaves through the global aluminum markets. The price of aluminum soared over the following weeks. Europe, which relies heavily on Russia\u2019s metals market, faced the prospect of plant closures and lost jobs. Even now, the European Union strongly supports the lifting of sanctions.\nThe move also disrupted Rusal\u2019s global supply chain. According to the Treasury Department, Rusal subsidiaries in the United States, Ireland, Sweden, Jamaica, Guinea, and elsewhere \"faced imminent closure,\" before the Treasury stepped in to mitigate some of the damage.\nAccording to experts, the Treasury discovered it had bitten off more than it could chew.\n\"They were done clumsily,\" Alina Polyakova, of the Brookings Institution, said of the sanctions. \"It seems clear that the administration did not plan for the dramatic effects on aluminum markets and the knock-on effects on European businesses.\"\nWarner himself acknowledged this aspect, saying, \"I know there's concerns from our European allies about these sanctions.\" That seems to undercut Senate Democrats\u2019 suggestion that sanctions-relief is a sign of undue coziness between team Trump and Russian oligarchs.\nStill, in the midst of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Moscow, the optics of the sanctions relief plan are not good. \"The Treasury was in a hopeless situation and does not want to state clearly that they made a mistake,\" said Anders \u00c5slund, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \"Therefore they now look as if they are helping Deripaska.\"\nOur ruling\nWarner said the Trump administration has \"a scheme to try to take (Deripaska\u2019s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45\" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions.\nWarner\u2019s description of the Treasury Department\u2019s deal with Deripaska is partially right, but it leaves out important details. The plan also entails corporate restructuring, plus additional reporting and transparency measures. And the sanctions against Deripaska himself would remain in place.\nMost experts we spoke to said sanctions relief wasn\u2019t a \"scheme\" so much as it was the Trump administration\u2019s way of ending the disruption it inflicted on the global metals market when it sanctioned Deripaska\u2019s aluminum company Rusal. In other words, it\u2019s more likely a case of clumsiness, rather coziness with Russian oligarchs \u2014 as Senate Democrats suggest.\nWe rate this Half True.\n Share the Facts 2019-01-15 18:58:56 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says the Trump administration has \"a scheme to try to take (Oleg Deripaska\u2019s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45\" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions.
