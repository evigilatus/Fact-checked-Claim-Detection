Dave Brat keeps telling voters in Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District that Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger wants a $32 trillion tax increase to pay for a \"government takeover of health care.\"\nYou don\u2019t have to look hard to find his claims.\n\"My opponent wants a tax increase of $32 trillion -- that's with a\u00a0 'T'\u00a0-- to pay for her socialist healthcare plan,\" Brat, a Republican, wrote in a Oct. 11 Facebook post.\n\"She and Nancy Pelosi want to...double down for a $32 trillion socialized takeover, government takeover, of health care,\" he said during and Oct. 15 debate with Spanberger.\n\"And we know Spanberger\u2019s health care plan would bankrupt Medicare as we know it - a $32 trillion spending increase that would double our taxes,\" says a Brat TV ad that debuted on Sept. 17.\n\"Spanberger\u2019s healthcare piece costs $32 trillion and will require you doubling the personal income tax rate - your personal taxes doubled - and the corporate rates doubled,\" Brat said during an Aug. 20 radio interview on the John Frederick Show,\nSpanberger has repeatedly denied Brat\u2019s charge. So we decided to test Brat\u2019s claim - that Spanberger wants a $32 trillion tax increase to pay for an overhaul of health care - on the Truth-O-Meter.\nBrat\u2019s Explanation\nBrat says his claim stems from a comment Spanberger made during a May 31 debate with Dan Ward, her opponent in this spring\u2019s Democratic primary.\nThe candidates were asked for their \"feelings about single-payer healthcare,\" a system in which one entity - the government - is responsible for providing health insurance and paying claims. Brat notes that Spanberger, in reply, said, \"...I do, in principle, support single payer\u2026\".\nBrat says those words prove Spanberger supports the Medicare for All Act of 2017, proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The bill, which is languishing in the Senate Finance Committee, would create a Medicare program that covers all Americans under one plan. Employers would be barred from offering competing insurance. Sanders\u2019 plan would cover primary care, hospital visits, lab services, medical devices, maternity care, prescriptions and vision and dental care. The only copayments would be for prescriptions.\nThe Mercatus Center, a free-market oriented research group at George Mason University, estimated Sanders\u2019 plan would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years. \"A doubling of all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan,\" the study, published in July 2018, said.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has not published a cost analysis of Sanders\u2019 plan.\nBrat has company among Republicans in claiming Spanberger endorsed Sanders\u2019 plan. \u00a0The Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC aligned to Speaker Paul Ryan, has run a TV ad that accuses Spanberger of \"supporting a $32 trillion government takeover of healthcare and raising middle-class taxes.\"\nFull picture\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanberger, in answering the debate question, only briefly addressed a single-payer \u00a0system. She spent most of her energy calling for the passage of Medicare X, a health care proposal that would give people under 65 an option: They could remain privately insured, or buy into a new government-run program that would use the network of Medicare providers and costs. The Medicare system is now reserved for elderly and disabled citizens.\nBrat focuses on one clause in Spanberger\u2019s answer. Here\u2019s a fuller excerpt of her \u00a0remarks. \u00a0\n\"I support Medicare X, which is a public option as a path towards universal coverage in the achievement of universal coverage. I believe that a public option is the way that we can achieve that goal through government-provided insurance that does, in fact, build off the existing Medicare network, because it exists in every single zip code across the country and that is the way we can achieve health care for everyone. And I do, in principle, support single-payer, but I believe universal coverage through a public option is the method I would pursue.\"\nSpanberger never mentioned Sanders. Nor was the senator referenced by the questioner or in the response by Ward - Spanberger\u2019s primary opponent.\nThis is important because Brat not only accuses Spanberger of championing a single-payer system, he links her to Sanders\u2019 proposal and its costs.The Mercatus Center, a libertarian research organization affiliated with George Mason University, estimates Sanders\u2019 plan would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years and wouldn\u2019t be paid for even if income and corporate taxes were doubled.\nSanders\u2019 plan is very generous. It would cover hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, prescriptions as well as vision and dental care. It would not subject consumers to any out-of-pockets costs, except a copay on prescriptions.\nBut if Congress wanted to, it could pass a single-payer system that would be cheaper than Sanders\u2019 plan, albeit still costly. For example, some single-payer countries require copays for medical treatment, some have don\u2019t cover dental and eye care, others don\u2019t cover long-term care.\nIn other words, it\u2019s possible to support \"in principle\" a single payer system but be opposed to Sanders\u2019 plan.\nSpanberger repeatedly has said she\u2019s against Sanders\u2019 bill and denounced Brat\u2019s attack as \"false.\"\u00a0It\u2019s a mystery what she meant when she said she supports single payer \"in principle.\" We found no evidence of her making a similar statement. When we asked Justin Jones, spokesman for Spanberger\u2019s campaign, to explain the remark, he said, \"She hasn\u2019t seen any single-payer plan she supports.\" He wouldn\u2019t elaborate.\nBrat says Spanberger changed her position on Sanders\u2019 bill after an Aug.3 editorial in the Richmond Times-Dispatch criticized its $32.6 trillion estimated cost and said the measure would lead to \"socializing medicine.\" The editorial didn\u2019t mention Spanberger.\nFinal Note: Medicare X has not been subjected to a rigid cost analysis. Supporters say it would at least break even because the bill requires that premiums \"cover the full actuarial cost of offering such a plan, including administrative costs.\" A 2013 CBO study concluded a similar program would reduce federal deficits by $158 billion over 10 years.\nOur Ruling\nBrat says Spanberger \"wants a tax increase of $32 trillion - that\u2019s with a `T,\u2019to pay for her socialist health care plan.\"\nThe charge - central to Brat\u2019s campaign - stems from Spanberger\u2019s May 2018 comment that she does \"in principle, support\" a single-payer health system. Brat offers that statement as proof that Spanberger backs a very generous single-payer proposal proposed by Sen. Sanders of Vermont in which all health insurance would come the federal government.\nSpanberger has caused some confusion because she\u2019s never explained her remark. It is possible, however, to be receptive to a single-payer program that\u2019s cheaper and more limited\u00a0than Sanders\u2019 plan.\nBrat offers no evidence that Spanberger has endorsed Sanders\u2019 plan, and she says she opposes it. On the other hand, Spanberger has repeatedly backed a Medicare X proposal that would allow the government to compete with private insurers. Unlike Sanders\u2019 plan, people would retain choices on where to buy coverage.\nBrat conveniently has chosen a position for Spanberger\u00a0that she never took.
