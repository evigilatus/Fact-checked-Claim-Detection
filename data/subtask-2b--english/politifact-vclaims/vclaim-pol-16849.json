But he\u2019s got no evidence.", "text": "Last week, the Missouri-based battery company Energizer announced plans to close its factory in Bennington.\u00a0\nThe company said it was shuttering the Vermont plant, which manufactures hearing aid batteries, and moving the operation to a new facility in Portage, Wisconsin, following a $2 billion deal to purchase Rayovac.\u00a0\nThe Energizer closing in Bennington will eliminate about 100 jobs. The layoffs are expected to deepen financial strain in the Southwest region of the state, which has seen a sharp decline in employment opportunities since the Great Recession.\u00a0\nGov. Phil Scott called Energizer\u2019s plans \"disappointing\" in a statement released last week. And he blamed the company\u2019s move on larger problems with the state\u2019s business climate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This decision is an unfortunate example of why those of us in Montpelier need to work together to make Vermont a more affordable place to do business and make sure our policies help businesses thrive rather than creating unique burdens and barriers to growth that make us less competitive with other states,\" Scott wrote in a statement last week.\u00a0\nThe governor\u2019s statement draws a direct connection between the state\u2019s business climate and Energizer\u2019s plans to shutter the factory.\u00a0\nWe wondered: Are Vermont\u2019s policymakers to blame for Energizer\u2019s pending departure?\u00a0\nEnergizer has said it is closing the Bennington factory \u2014 which was downsized in 2015\u2014 to consolidate operations in the Wisconsin Rayovac factory, which also produces hearing aid batteries.\nThe only public statements Energizer has made on the decision indicate it is making the move because it would be more efficient for the company to produce the hearing aid batteries in one factory. The Portage plant employs more than twice as many workers than the Bennington facility (about 225 compared to 90). It\u2019s also slightly larger.\n\"In order to be successful as a larger company, we are making significant investments to better utilize our existing manufacturing facilities, reduce complexity in our operations, and enhance service to our customers,\" Marcus Boolish, Energizer\u2019s director of government affairs wrote in a letter to Sen. Dick Sears, D-Bennington, last week.\u00a0\nNikki Eaves, an Energizer spokesperson, offered a similar explanation to the Bennington Banner, saying that the facility in Wisconsin is equipped to handle the company\u2019s hearing aid production.\u00a0\n\"As part of the integration,\" she said, \"we reviewed our combined manufacturing footprint and determined the total demand for specialty batteries can be produced more efficiently in one facility.\"\nThe company did not respond to questions from VTDigger about whether the state\u2019s business climate contributed to its decision to leave the state.\u00a0\nBut Rebecca Kelley, a spokesperson for Scott, said that it was \"self-evident\" that Energizer is moving out of state because Vermont\u2019s business environment isn\u2019t competitive.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said that if it was \"advantageous\" for Energizer to ramp up its production in Vermont, the company would have kept operations here.\u00a0\nKelley pointed to the fact that Vermont has among the highest power costs in the nation and some of the highest corporate and property taxes, according to the Tax Foundation\u2019s latest business tax climate index. In 2018, Forbes ranked Vermont 47th in its U.S. \"Best for Business\" rankings and said that the cost of doing business in the state is 12% higher than the national average.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Businesses are going to do what\u2019s in the best interest of the business,\" Kelley said. \"If their decision is to leave the state for another state, that indicates it is more advantageous and more competitive in that other state.\"\u00a0\nKelly did not, however, provide any additional evidence that Vermont\u2019s business climate contributed to Energizer\u2019s factory consolidation.\u00a0\nSears, the senator from Bennington, said it would be hard to evaluate whether the governor\u2019s statement is true, unless the company provided more information about its decision.\n\"I think it\u2019s unclear what the reasons are for them not investing in Vermont,\" he said. \"You can generalize and say it\u2019s anti-business and Wisconsin\u2019s more business-friendly. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not.\"\nThe senator said he couldn\u2019t recall the company lobbying legislators on business issues in the Statehouse, except on one occasion. About a decade ago, when Vermont banned mercury in batteries, the company asked lawmakers for a period of time to phase-out use of the chemical instead of an immediate ban. Sears said he worked to get that language written into the bill.\u00a0\nKelley said the governor\u2019s office was seeking more information from Energizer about its reasons for leaving Vermont.\u00a0\nSen. Brian Campion, D-Bennington, said Scott should have that conversation with Energizer before he \"speculates\" on its motivations.\u00a0\n\"I think it\u2019s important to hear directly from Energizer on what kind of things would have or even could keep them here,\" Campion said, noting that the company doesn\u2019t plan to fully shutter its doors in Bennington until 2021.\n\"Are there things that could be done between now and then that could keep Energizer here?\"\nOur ruling\u00a0\nThe governor is correct that by most measures, when compared to other states, Vermont ranks low on business friendliness. But his claim is specifically about Energizer\u2019s reason for leaving.\u00a0\nAccording to Scott\u2019s statement, the fact that Energizer is moving away, in and of itself, reveals the company wasn\u2019t satisfied with Vermont\u2019s business environment.\nHis office can provide no evidence to support his claim. The only reason Energizer has cited for its move is that consolidation of operations in its Wisconsin facility \u2014 recently purchased from Rayovac \u2014 will streamline production.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this claim false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16849"}
