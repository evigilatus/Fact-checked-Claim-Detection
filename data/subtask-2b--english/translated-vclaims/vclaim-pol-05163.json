Trump, who admires China's GDP growth and the Great Wall, but considers it a brilliant maneuver in the world, was bumping into a country that became one of its favorite targets in an interview with The New York Times. \"You know, we've rebuilt China,\" said Trump. \"The money they drained from the United States rebuilt China. They did it through monetary manipulation, through devaluation. And very sophisticated. I mean, they're big chess players when the currency is devalued.\" We were curious about Trump &apos; s claim that the United States is responsible for China &apos; s rapid economic growth. This point was made several times in the New York Times interview alone. We also reviewed two other claims from the interview concerning Chinese import tax and its activity in the South China Sea. According to Tramp in The New York Times, China's transition from one of the world's poorest countries to its second largest economy was possible through \"bad trade deals\" with the United States. This is an oversimplified expression of the economic relationship between the two countries. Experts disagree on the extent to which the United States has an impact on the Chinese economy, but say that Trump's claim ignores many other factors. \"In one small sense, Trump is right,\" said Scott Lincicome, a scientist at the liberal Kato Institute who specializes in international trade policy. \"Trade with all countries, including the United States, was part of a major market reform that lifted millions out of poverty in China. Property and tax reforms were much more important.\" Economists refer to the opening of China in the late 1970s and early 1980s as the beginning of its meteoroid growth. Following Mao Zedong &apos; s death, the Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping introduced economic reforms and opened trade with the West in 1979. From then until 2014, China experienced a two-digit annual GDP growth rate, effectively doubling its economy every eight years, according to the Congressional Research Service. It can be said that China &apos; s economic liberalization, and its subsequent prosperity, have been driven by years of United States efforts at convergence through Henry Kissinger &apos; s secret visits, Richard Nixon &apos; s historic journey, and, of course, ping-pong. In 2000, the United States also exerted pressure for China &apos; s accession to the WTO (as Tramp states on his website), further entrenching Beijing into the world economy. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012 today, the United States and China were their largest trading partners. Trump argued that the United States was \"losing\" due to the trade imbalance between the two countries, but whether it was useful or harmful to the United States, it was debatable. \"I will not say that the American deficit rebuilt China, but they may have allowed China to rebuild itself at a much lower domestic political cost,\" said Michael Bates, an expert in Chinese economics at the Carnegie Fund for International Peace and a professor at Beijing University. \"Our consumption has benefited the Chinese people, just like how they consume Europe and everyone,\" said Lancecom. \"The American request helped Chinese companies, so there's a piece of truth to it, but we're not the only ones.\" According to Tramp's logic, you can argue that China has also rebuilt America by providing America with cheaper goods and thus more savings, referring to Zhiu Chen, a professor of economics and a professor of finance at Yale University specializing in Chinese economics. \"Without those savings or Chinese financing of US government debt and corporate investment, the United States has not been able to sustain this kind of real estate, defense and business growth for many years.\" \"In a globalized, interdependent world, it's really hard to say who's rebuilding it.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"We've rebuilt China.\" China &apos; s economic growth can be largely attributed to its domestic reforms and its integration into world trade. The United States could take some, but certainly not all, thanks to the latter. We're assessing Trump's claim of half the integrity.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05163"}
