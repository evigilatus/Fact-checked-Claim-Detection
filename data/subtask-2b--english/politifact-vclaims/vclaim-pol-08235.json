Scott Walker\u2019s tax-relief plan drew a strong response from the state Republican Party.\n\"While Millionaire Mary Burke has called Walker\u2019s tax relief plan \u2018irresponsible,\u2019 the reality is she helped construct some of the most irresponsible budgets and policies in our state\u2019s history,\" said Joe Fadness, executive director of the state party, in a Feb. 10, 2014 news release.\n\"Burke promoted budgets that raised taxes by billions, created high structural deficits and raided funds to finance huge spending hikes.\"\nFadness accused Burke, who was state Commerce secretary from 2005 to 2007, of \"ignoring her record of drafting and sponsoring budgets that set Wisconsin on a downward spiral\" under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle.\nIn the election, prepare to hear a lot from Walker and his allies about Burke\u2019s ties to Doyle.\nIn this item, we\u2019ll examine whether Burke helped \"draft\" \"sponsor\" and \"promote\" budgets that \"raised taxes by billions, created high structural deficits and raided funds.\"\nBurke\u2019s role in budgets\nDuring Burke\u2019s tenure as commerce secretary, Doyle signed a pair of two-year state budgets into law.\nThe first budget was introduced Feb. 8, 2005. Burke began her job just one day earlier as Doyle\u2019s pick to run the state\u2019s primary economic development agency.\nDepartment budget submissions were due in fall of 2004 and were months in the making, so Burke would have had effectively no chance to affect the Commerce budget, much less Doyle\u2019s entire blueprint.\nJesse Dougherty, spokesman for the state GOP, said that cabinet secretaries should be held accountable for what the Administration puts forth.\nAs evidence that Burke \"promoted\" Doyle\u2019s 2005-07 budget, Dougherty pointed to an April 2005 Wisconsin State Journal interview in which Burke said that while politically independent, \"I support Gov. Doyle's positions entirely.\"\nBurke\u2019s role in the second budget in question (2007-09) is somewhat clearer.\nShe was responsible for and submitted the Commerce budget, but also spoke out enthusiastically in favor of a variety of initiatives in Doyle\u2019s overall state budget, on taxes, education, worker training, health care and others.\n\"Gov. Jim Doyle's 2007-09 budget is a smart, responsible budget for Wisconsin businesses. It is fiscally responsible, identifies our priorities for success, and invests in those priorities,\" Burke wrote in a 2007 Commerce newsletter.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo while Burke\u2019s department is not involved in drafting the overall state budget, the GOP says her actions as a team player give her a degree of responsibility over the overall final product.\nWe agree that Burke \"promoted\" the two budgets, but \"drafting\" goes too far.\nFiscal impact of those budgets\nLet\u2019s look at the three GOP statements about the Doyle budgets that coincided with Burke\u2019s tenure.\n\"Raised taxes by billions\": The budgets Doyle submitted included tax-policy changes that raised net taxes, cumulatively, by $1.35 billion (down $12.68 million in the first budget, then up $1.371 billion in the second). Examples of changes included increases in cigarette taxes, a new tax on oil-company earnings, and a new revenues tax on hospitals.\nThe budgets Doyle signed, after legislators changed them, raised net taxes by $351 million, according to reports by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\nBig money, but not \"billions\" in either scenario.\n\"Created high structural deficits\": In criticizing Walker\u2019s plan to return half of an expected surplus to taxpayers, Burke noted reports saying his plan would boost by about $100 million a potential $700 million shortfall -- or \"structural deficit\" -- heading into the 2015-17 budget.\nBy contrast, the two Doyle budgets in question left much higher structural deficits -- $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion each -- than either of Walker\u2019s two budgets. And, notably, Walker\u2019s first budget actually created a small structural surplus for the following budget.\n\"Raided funds to finance huge spending hikes\": It\u2019s been well-documented that Doyle and lawmakers repeatedly tapped segregated funds for roads, compensation in malpractice cases and other purposes in order to balance the state budget.\nSignificant withdrawals occurred in the two budgets that overlapped with Burke\u2019s time.\nOur rating\nState Republicans said that as state Commerce secretary, Burke drafted, sponsored and promoted \"budgets that raised taxes by billions, created high structural deficits and raided funds to finance huge spending hikes.\"\nThere are accurate elements here but some critical facts are ignored or misstated.\nBurke had a hand in budgeting, as any cabinet member would, and lauded two Doyle budgets, which did indeed leave high structural deficits and bust into segregated funds.\nBut it\u2019s a big overstatement to say she \"drafted\" two overall state budgets, especially given that the 2005-07 version came out just one day after she joined Doyle\u2019s administration.\nIn any event, those two budget proposals from Doyle raised taxes by $1.35 billion, not \"billions\" as claimed.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08235"}
