Chris Christie\u2019s watch, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging Christie, a Republican, in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial contest.\nRutgers tuition has increased 10 percent since Christie took office because he \"cut funding for higher education,\" Buono told students during a recent stop at the university's New Brunswick campus.\nWhile the cost of an education at Rutgers and other schools in New Jersey has certainly risen in recent years, we were a bit stunned by this Rutgers Law School alumna\u2019s claim: not only has tuition at the state university climbed by less than 10 percent from the time Christie became governor in January 2010 to present, Buono\u2019s putting blame where it doesn\u2019t belong.\nLet\u2019s start by reviewing tuition costs for Rutgers since Christie\u2019s been in office.\nTuition for in-state residents at Rutgers was $9,926 for the 2010-2011 academic year -- the first year that a Rutgers budget was crafted during Christie\u2019s tenure as governor. Tuition is $10,718 for the current 2013-2014 academic calendar. That\u2019s an increase of 7.97 percent, not 10 percent.\nDavid Turner, a Buono for Governor spokesman, told us it would be more appropriate to compare tuition and fees from 2009-2010 \u2013 before Christie took office \u2013 to 2013-2014. So we looked at those numbers, too.\nTuition and fees for 2009-2010 was $11,886, compared with $13,499 for the current academic year. That\u2019s an increase of 13.57 percent, which is in line with Buono\u2019s claim.\nBut there\u2019s a key difference: Buono specifically referenced a tuition increase so we removed fees from the equation and compared tuition from 2009-2010 ($9,546) with 2013-2014 ($10,718). The difference is an increase of 12.27 percent.\nThat brings us to another critical point: Buono claims the increase has occurred \"since Christie took office.\"\nTurner said Christie's cuts to education had long-reaching effects on students.\n\"One of the Governor's first major acts was to slash New Jersey's higher education budget by more than $170 million,\" he said in an e-mail. \"By cutting the budget, the costs fell on to students who are now shouldering a 13% increase in tuition at our flagship university. These cuts unfairly place the burden on students and make it harder for them to get the skills they need to compete in the workforce of tomorrow.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristie in 2010 proposed cutting $173 million from higher education funding as the state faced a variety of deficits at the height of the recession.\nBut is he solely to blame for tuition hikes at Rutgers? No.\nIn fact, the governor of New Jersey has nothing to do with setting tuition costs at colleges and universities.\nUnder state law, the Rutgers Board of Governors sets tuition and determines the rates of tuition for the institution as part of the university\u2019s annual budget, a spokesman told us.\nChristie spokesman Michael Drewniak agreed.\n\"Governors have no role in setting tuition, room/board and various fees at Rutgers,\" Drewniak explained in an e-mail. \"The Board of Governors votes annually to set those rates based on recommendations from the school\u2019s administrators. Surely, the Senator knows this given her vast experience in the legislature.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that impacts from the recession also were being felt statewide at that time, even in education. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines the recession as lasting from December 2007 to June 2009.\nOur ruling\nBuono said during a recent visit to Rutgers that the university's tuition has increased 10 percent since Christie took office because he \"cut funding for higher education.\"\nWhen looking strictly at tuition costs, Rutgers tuition has increased 7.97 percent from the 2010-2011 academic year -- the first Rutgers budget done after Christie became governor -- to the current 2013-2014. The increase, however, \u00a0is 12.27 percent if measured from the year before Christie became governor.\nAs for blame, state law makes clear that the Rutgers Board of Governors -- not the governor himself -- sets tuition rates for the university. And while it's true that Christie did cut education funding, he doesn't bare the bulk of the blame for the tuition hikes. Many factors were involved.\nAs a result, we rate this claim Half True.\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08853"}
