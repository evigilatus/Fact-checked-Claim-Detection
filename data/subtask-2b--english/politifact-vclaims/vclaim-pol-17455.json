(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nBongino uses charts to suggest that violent crime spiked during Buttigieg\u2019s two terms, which ran from Jan. 1, 2012, to Jan. 1, 2020.\u00a0\nAt first glance the claim appears to be backed up with the gold standard of violent crime statistics \u2014 the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Report.\u00a0\nBut there\u2019s more to this story: South Bend changed how it reported the numbers to the FBI, making it appear that violent crime experienced an alarming spike under Buttigieg\u2019s leadership. That isn\u2019t what happened. Let\u2019s take a look.\nViolent crime defined\nThe FBI says violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.\nSouth Bend reported 744 violent crimes to the FBI in 2011 \u2014 the year before Buttigieg took office.\nIn 2012, Buttigieg\u2019s first year as mayor, the number fell to 622 \u2014 a drop of 16%.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, violent crimes rose in 2013, 2014 and 2015 \u2014 but still remained lower than 2011.\nAfter that, the numbers get tricky.\nIn 2016, based on advice from the FBI, South Bend police changed how it counted aggravated assaults \u2014 and the number of violent crimes reported by South Bend spiked, exceeding 1,000 in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available.\nPreviously, South Bend had not been counting instances where a weapon was shown or implied as an aggravated assault, said Jeff Asher, data analyst and consultant at AH Datalytics who has written in the New York Times about violent crime in South Bend.\u00a0\n\"The evidence is telling us that South Bend didn\u2019t become more violent; it simply changed how it counted assaults,\" he wrote.\nThe FBI noted the issue in comparing annual totals in South Bend from 2016 forward this way:\u00a0 \"Because of changes in\" South Bend's \"reporting practices, figures are not comparable to previous years' data.\"\nSimilarly, the FBI changed its definition of rape in 2013, which led to an increase in rape figures nationwide, Asher said.\nA Wall Street Journal editorial also took Buttigieg to task, saying an increase in violent crime in South Bend outpaced that of Indiana as a whole. But the editorial also noted the change in how South Bend counts violent crimes.\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\nAn article shared on Facebook claims: \"Violent crime in South Bend doubled during Mayor Pete\u2019s tenure.\"\nThe raw numbers suggest such an increase \u2014 but not because the number of violent crimes doubled.\nWhat happened is that, based on guidance from the FBI, South Bend changed the way it defined a type of assault, and counting of that violent crime increased significantly. The FBI said South Bend\u2019s violent crime numbers from 2016 forward can\u2019t be compared with those from previous years.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17455"}
