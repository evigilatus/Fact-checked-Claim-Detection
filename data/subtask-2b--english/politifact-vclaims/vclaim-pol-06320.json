So HBO host and news-comedian John Oliver surprised us, and maybe even himself, on Last Week Tonight when he hailed Florida as a model for the country for a component of its judicial system \u2014 and not for, say, assaults with a slice of pizza, or something like that.\nOliver criticized the money-bail system that exists throughout most of the country in his June 7 episode, saying it leaves people who are too poor to make bail for non-violent offenses behind bars, which drives up jail costs and destroys livelihoods.\nAs an alternative, Oliver made the case for pretrial service programs. With these services, he said, a person who is arrested would be interviewed by a specialist to see if he or she poses a flight risk or is dangerous. The specialist makes a recommendation to a judge, and the judge decides whether to send the person home, where he or she may be monitored with drug tests, ankle monitors and phone calls about court dates.\n\"And pretrial service programs have succeeded around the country in places ranging from Oregon to Florida,\" Oliver said. \"And it is a truly frightening state of affairs when Florida is a model for progressive change.\"\nHe added, \"Did you know by the way that under Florida law, if you possess over 5 grams of meth, you can marry it. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s a legal fact. That\u2019s an actual photo that ran in a newspaper\u2019s wedding section in Florida. And yet even counties in Florida recognize that our money bail system is broken.\"\nAs he described that \"fact,\" this image appeared:\n\nFor the record, it is not a \"legal fact\" that you can marry meth in Florida. That was a joke.\nHowever, we did want to unpack his more serious claim that Florida is a \"model for progressive change\" for its successful pretrial release programs. That wasn\u2019t meant to be a joke.\nOliver\u2019s staff did not comment for this fact-check.\nPretrial justice experts we consulted said while Florida has some positive things going for it, calling it a nationwide model is a bit of a stretch.\nCherise Fanno Burdeen is executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute, which supports alternatives to money bail. (The institute is also\u00a0petitioning Gov. Andrew Cuomo to end New York\u2019s money bail system after the suicide of Kalief Browder, who was\u00a0kept in Rikers Island prison for three years without trial in part because he could not make bail after being accused of stealing a backpack).\nBurdeen, who said she spoke to Oliver\u2019s team before the show, said she would not have hailed Florida as a progressive pretrial services model.\nWashington, D.C., and Kentucky, yes. Oregon and Colorado, sure.\nBut Florida?\n\"That\u2019s probably not a statement I would make,\" Burdeen said. \"It\u2019s definitely more nuanced.\"\nIn the mid 1970s, amid national reforms, some Florida counties started pretrial service programs \u2014 mainly because of jail overcrowding. Programs exist today in 29 of 67 counties.\nNot all states have done that, Burdeen said. But Florida does not offer pretrial services statewide, and \"it certainly has a long way to go in terms of other needed components of reform,\" she said.\nOne example: Only a few counties use accredited standards for assessing an arrested person\u2019s flight risk and danger to the community before trial. The counties that are accredited by the Florida Corrections Accreditation Commission are\u00a0Alachua, Broward, Lee, Miami-Dade, Orange and Volusia, which combined are home to\u00a07.2 million residents, or 36 percent of the state's estimated population.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida could be considered loosely \"progressive,\" Burdeen said, because pretrial programs exist in most counties where the vast majority of criminal case filings happen.\nIn 2013, Miami-Dade County served more than 10,500 people, Broward County served more than 6,000, and Palm Beach, Polk and Pinellas counties served more than 5,000, according to the\u00a0annual report\u00a0of pretrial service programs in the state by the\u00a0Florida Legislature's\u00a0Office of Program Policy Analysis and\u00a0Government Accountability.\nThe point of the bail system is to ensure a defendant showed up for court, and sometimes the only way to do it is to keep him or her in jail, said Bob Dekle, University of Florida College of Law legal skills professor.\n\"Florida\u2019s model for pretrial detention and release is a fair, equitable model,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s on the outer fringes of the avant garde in turning people loose from jail, and I rather doubt it, but I don\u2019t believe that it is regressive. It\u2019s just there and that\u2019s what it is.\"\nFor virtually all crimes except capital offenses, Florida law says the presumption of release should be on nonmonetary conditions. Still, Burdeen said most counties rely on a bond schedule for crimes.\n\"If you can pay it out, you get out, if not you go to first appearance,\" she said. \"Almost without a doubt the judge continues that amount from the schedule; if not, you back to your cell.\"\nExperts also pointed out that \"pretrial services\" means something different depending on the jurisdiction.\nIn Florida\u2019s Monroe County, home of the Florida Keys, pretrial services workers interview defendants, review their criminal histories and develop recommendations for a judge based on a point-scoring system that helps determine if they should be released on their own recognizance or released under supervision of the pretrial services agency. The judge can also choose to set a money bond amount.\nIn Pinellas County, pretrial services are not run by a court or a county agency \u2014 they're\u00a0run through the sheriff's office.\u00a0When someone is arrested, booking deputies have the option of setting a recommended bond for an offense or a higher or lower bond depending on the circumstances. Often the low bond is to release the defendant at the jail on his or her own recognizance, known as ROR.\nIf a defendant remains in jail until the first appearance, the judge could still decide to change the booking deputy's bond or recommend unsupervised or supervised ROR, which could include check-ins or electronic monitoring. When a judge is unsure, pretrial services staffers can conduct their own investigation into a defendant's background and advise the judge accordingly.\n\"It's a very, very useful tool to manage the jail population,\" said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri.\nSpurgeon Kennedy, National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies vice president, said the vast majority of American counties do not have pretrial programs, so the fact that Florida has some is a positive in his group\u2019s view.\nThat said, the money-bail system remains prevalent and powerful throughout the state.\n\"Unfortunately, Florida uses money primarily, and that\u2019s the reason why we would hesitate to say what is happening in Florida is a model,\" Kennedy said. \"But you do have these programs.\"\nKennedy would look elsewhere for states closer to pretrial service utopia. In Washington, D.C., as Oliver also highlighted, the Pretrial Services Agency helps judges in the D.C. Superior Court and U.S. District Court by recommending release conditions for defendants that are based on their circumstances and are usually non-financial. And Kentucky abolished its commercial bail system in 1976, relying instead on a single statewide agency employing pretrial officers who interview people in jail and facilitate their release.\nOur ruling\nOliver said \"pretrial service programs have succeeded around the country,\" namely Florida, adding, \"And it is a truly frightening state of affairs when Florida is a model for progressive change.\"\nExperts in pretrial justice, several of whom talked with Oliver\u2019s staff, said certain counties within Florida have demonstrated success with pretrial services as a way to reduce jail costs and eliminate overcrowding in jails. But they said he went a bit too far in leaving his viewers with the idea that Florida is among states that go above and beyond for defendants.\nThere are pockets of progress, advocates said, but the commercial bail bonding industry is also strong in the state, and not every county has pretrial services.\nOliver\u2019s claim rates claim Half True.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the name of the Florida Legislature's\u00a0Office of Program Policy Analysis and\u00a0Government Accountability.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06320"}
