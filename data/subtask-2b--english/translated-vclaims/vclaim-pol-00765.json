It started with the president when he made a false statement in March that wind turbine electricity stopped when the wind stopped. A month later, Trump crawled to make burning pants claim that windmills cause cancer. Now, we have Mimi roaming the social media that claims that Canadian author and Professor Thomas Homer Dixon said that windmills will never generate the energy that was spent to build structures. Full quote: \"A megawatt windmill contains 260 tons of steel requiring 170 tons of coking coal and 300 tons of iron ore, all mine and transport and produced by hydrocarbons.\" A windmill can spin until it collapses and does not generate the energy that it has invested in building. As part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast, reference has been made to the Mim. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In fact, it dates back to 2015, but it still appears on social media. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. No, Homer Dixon didn't say or write this. The phrase is a partial quote chosen from a chapter written by Earth World David Hughes in the 2009 book \"The Carbon Transformation: How the Oil Plate and the Climate Crisis will Change Canada (and Our Lives), a book edited by Homer Dixon. The full passage is as follows: \"The concept of net energy must also be applied to renewable sources of energy, such as windmills and photovoltaics. A megawattine windmill contains 260 tons of steel requiring 170 tons of coking coal and 300 tons of iron ore, all of which are extracted, transported and produced by hydrocarbons. The question is: How long does an windmill have to generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it? At a good wind site, energy recovery day can be in three years or less; at a weak location, energy recovery may never be. That is, the windmill can spin until it collapses and does not generate the energy that it has invested in its construction.\" The Mimi gets part of the correct quote, but it strategically leaves large amounts of information to give people the impression that all windmills never spend the amount of energy they invested in, which is inaccurate. While poorly designed windmills may never generate enough energy, a good wind site can generate it within three years or less. Homer Dixon, who served as Founding Director of the Waterloo Institute of Complexity and Innovation and is currently a professor at the Sili School of International Affairs, even called Palmi in an article in May 2018 on his website. \"It should be noted that it would be pointless to put wind turbines in poor locations, which is trivial, or meaningless, to say that turbines will never pay their potential in a vulnerable location,\" was written by Homer Dixon in the article. \"So, 1) I did not write the text, 2) the text itself is selectively quoted, 3) and the argument he makes, taken in isolation, makes no sense. Three strikes.\" We're assessing this wrong.
