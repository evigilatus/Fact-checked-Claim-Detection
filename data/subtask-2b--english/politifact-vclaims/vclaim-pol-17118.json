Gideon has served in Maine\u2019s state House since 2013 and as its speaker since 2016.\nMany news accounts say the race is one that could determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats.\nWith polls showing a tight contest \u2014 the Cook Political Report has rated the race a tossup \u2014 federal aid programs for businesses have become a focal point of attacks on both sides.\nHow the PPP works\nCongress created the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic avoid layoffs. The program was established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, signed into law in March by President Donald Trump.\nThe law provides for up to $659 billion in loans for businesses so they can pay their employees and cover certain other expenses, such as rent and utilities. The loans are forgiven if businesses meet specified terms.\nWhile the federal government created and administers the program, banks, credit unions and other lending institutions handle the loan applications and disbursement of funds.\nCollins\u2019 ad\nCollins\u2019 ad launched on Facebook on Aug. 1. According to Facebook, it has been viewed 175,000 to 200,000 times.\nWayne Parry, who is identified as a Maine lobsterman in the ad, appears in and narrates the 30-second piece. As has been reported, Parry also served four terms as Republican state representative, backed by campaign donations from a Collins political action committee, and is currently running for his old seat.\nThe ad\u2019s first claim is about a PPP loan of \"up to $2 million\" to the law firm of Gideon\u2019s husband, personal-injury attorney Benjamin Gideon.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBerman & Simmons, a Lewiston law firm where Benjamin Gideon is a partner, received a PPP loan of between $1 million and $2 million, according to data from the Small Business Administration. The loan came from a Lewiston bank. The firm did not reply to our request for the exact amount of the loan it received.\nGideon campaign spokeswoman Maeve Coyle said Benjamin Gideon is one of 11 partners at the firm and was not involved in seeking the PPP money. She said 43 of the firm\u2019s 61 employees are not attorneys, and that nearly all Maine law firms took PPP loans because the pandemic closed courts.\nMost large Maine law firms sought PPP aid, the Associated Press reported.\n\"Falsely attacks Collins\"\nCollins\u2019 ad says Gideon\u2019s criticisms have included a false attack on Collins over the program. It cites a June 15 article by the Washington Post Fact Checker that called a Gideon attack ad \"highly misleading.\" Still, there are some facts behind Gideon\u2019s attack that are literally accurate, as new reporting from ProPublica shows.\u00a0\nThe Gideon ad claimed: \"As coronavirus spread, Susan Collins took $12,000 from the corporate hotel industry. Then Collins wrote a special loophole into her bill allowing large, out-of-state hotels to get millions \u2014 while only one in 10 Maine small businesses were getting the help they needed.\"\nWe found that Collins collected a total of $12,500 in donations in February from hotel industry political actions. Her campaign committee received $2,500 from the International Franchise Association; $2,500 from Hilton Worldwide; and $2,500 from American Lodging and Hotel. And the American Lodging and Hotel PAC gave $5,000 to Collins\u2019 leadership PAC.\nAs for the timing, by mid-February, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed 15 coronavirus cases in the United States. Collins and other senators began drafting the PPP bill in early March, said her campaign spokesman, Kevin Kelley.\nCollins was a key drafter of the PPP, which targeted aid to businesses with 500 or fewer employees. She did respond to lobbying from the hotel industry.\nAs reported Aug. 6 by ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning nonprofit newsroom, Collins\u2019 office said it had been contacted during the drafting process by the International Franchise Association and the American Hotel and Lodging Association, among other business interests, and ultimately an exception was written in the legislation for restaurant and hotel chains. Collins took credit for the exception, which allowed those companies to apply with up to 500 employees per location, even if they were much bigger overall.\nAt least 59 large hotel companies were approved for more than 600 forgivable government loans totaling up to $1 billion despite having more than 500 employees overall, according to ProPublica.\nIn an opinion article she authored, Collins called ProPublica \"a left-wing outlet that is financed by Democratic billionaires.\" She defended the exception, saying it made a franchise hotel owner eligible \"as intended to help keep the business afloat and its workers employed,\" but that a large corporate chain such as Hilton \"is prohibited from receiving a PPP loan for its corporate headquarters or any hotels that it owns and operates directly.\"\nOn Gideon\u2019s claim that at the time, only one in 10 small businesses in Maine got the forgivable PPP loans, the Bangor Daily News reported that statistic as of mid-April, saying 16,000 Maine small businesses had received aid. That was at a point when the first batch of PPP funds had been exhausted.\nFederal figures show that as of Aug. 8, more than 28,000 PPP loans were made in Maine. So, Gideon\u2019s number was from initial reports that later increased.\u00a0\nOverall, we found Gideon\u2019s attack on Collins to be a mixture of exaggeration and accuracy.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nCollins claimed that Gideon\u2019s husband\u2019s law firm \"took up to $2 million\" from the same federal program she \"falsely\" attacked Susan Collins over.\nThe law firm where Gideon\u2019s husband is a partner did take a loan through the federal Payment Protection Program program that could be as large as $2 million. With fewer than 500 employees, the firm qualifies as a small business under the program\u2019s guidelines. But Gideon\u2019s attack on Collins is largely accurate.\u00a0\nAs Gideon claimed in an ad, after Collins received campaign contributions from the hotel industry, she wrote an exception in the PPP law that, according to a ProPublica investigation, enabled at least 59 large hotel companies to be approved for more than 600 forgivable government loans totaling up to $1 billion.\nWe rate Collins\u2019 statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17118"}
