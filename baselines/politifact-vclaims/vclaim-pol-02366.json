Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who drew attention after the Las Vegas massacre in October when he announced he would donate to gun control groups roughly $20,000 that the NRA\u2019s political action committee gave him over the years. Ryan received an A grade from the NRA earlier in his career but later broke from the group.\n\"Seventy to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check,\" Ryan said on CNN\u2019s New Day Feb. 20, days after the shooting in South Florida that left 17 people dead.\nPolls have consistently showed broad support for a universal background check. National polls in 2016 and 2017\u00a0found between 84 and 94 percent of respondents supported background checks. But what about NRA members?\nWhat NRA members say about a universal background check\nWhile federal law requires background checks for sales from federally licensed dealers, unlicensed, private sellers are not required to conduct background checks \u2014 although states can create their own laws.\nSome gun control advocates want a nationwide standard to close loopholes.\nRyan\u2019s spokesman cited a 2015 poll of gun owners by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm, conducted on behalf of two liberal groups: MoveOn.org Civic Action and the Center for American Progress. The poll surveyed 816 gun owners.\nAccording to the poll, 24 percent of the respondents identified themselves as NRA members. That means of the total of 816 gun owners, 196 self-identified as NRA members.\nOf all 816 gun owners, 83 percent responded that they supported a criminal background check for everyone who wants to buy a firearm.\nFor the 196 who said they were NRA members, the poll showed that 72 percent supported background checks.\nThe margin of error for the NRA sample is 7 percentage points, said Jim Williams, an analyst for Public Policy Polling.\n\"Given that the support for background checks among the NRA subsample is so overwhelming, it\u2019s still far outside the margin of error for that subset,\" he said.\nWe also found an additional poll that included NRA members taking a position on background checks.\nPew Research Center conducted a poll of 3,930 U.S. adults, including 1,269 gun owners, in March and April 2017. The unweighted sample size in the survey included 262 respondents who identified as NRA members.\nThe poll included a breakdown of replies from Republican gun owners who were and were not members of the NRA. The poll showed based on weighted data that 52 percent of NRA members favored background checks for private gun sales compared with 75 percent of nonmembers.\nPolitiFact has previously looked at polls as far back as 2013 that found majority support among NRA members or households where someone was a member of the NRA.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Portman\n\n\nstated on June 28, 2010 in a campaign statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Lee Fisher once said, \"I never met a gun control bill I didn\u2019t like.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Stephen Koff \u2022 July 25, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, a poll done by Johns Hopkins University and conducted online among 2,703 adults \u2014 including 169 respondents who identified as a member of the NRA \u2014 through GfK Knowledge Networks. The poll found that 74 percent of NRA members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. (The margin of error was 7 percentage points.)\nAfter our 2015 fact-check of a claim related to that poll, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker contacted PolitiFact contending that the poll could not accurately survey NRA members because only the NRA has access to the list of current, dues-paying members. It is common practice in polling to ask respondents to identify whether they are members of, for example, a political party or other group. The NRA didn\u2019t respond for this fact-check.\nWe also previously looked at a poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz in 2012 commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s group. That poll showed 74 percent of respondents who identified as NRA members favored background checks. The poll included 945 gun owners, half of whom said they were current or lapsed members of the NRA and the others non-NRA members.\nWhat polling experts said about the polls\nJanine Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll and a professor at the University of Arkansas, said that the polls do not reflect a large enough sample of NRA members to reach the conclusion that 70 to 80 percent of NRA members support background checks.\nWhile it\u2019s tempting to take a national sample and try to drill down, when looking at a smaller subset such as NRA members \"you end up generalizing and that can be dangerous,\" she said.\nIdeally, a poll would include somewhere between 750 and 1,000 NRA members, she said.\n\"You would need an independent polling organization to either oversample NRA members or have a big enough national sample to get you to at least 500, but preferably closer to 750 NRA members who can stand as a sample on their own,\" she said.\nWe interviewed some polling experts who said that additional polls would help shed more light on the views of NRA members and that there are caveats about these polls\u2019 methodologies.\nPolling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis, told PolitiFact that the smaller the actual subgroup in the national population, the lower the precision and the larger the margin of error.\nHowever, if several polls show a majority of NRA members favor background checks, that increases the confidence in the findings.\nSome of our polling experts raised some criticisms about methodology.\nAndrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Polling Center, said he is dubious of any Interactive Voice Response (IVR) polling as the one done by Public Policy Polling.\n\"They have incredibly low response rates and there is evidence that only the most politically motivated people really want to talk to a computer about their opinions,\" he said.\nWilliams, of Public Policy Polling, defended the methodology and said IVR polling can cut down on social desirability bias \u2014\u00a0people telling a human questioner the answer they think they are \"supposed\" to say.\nOur ruling\nRyan said that \"70 to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check.\"\nRyan is citing a poll from Public Policy Polling, conducted in 2015 for liberal groups. That poll found that among the respondents who said they were NRA members, the poll showed that 72 percent supported background checks.\u00a0Other polls we looked at showed that between 52 and 74 percent of NRA members supported background checks.\nThese polls are imperfect because they include small samples of NRA members, but they all suggest a majority of NRA members support background checks.\u00a0New polling of larger numbers of NRA members\u00a0would shed more light on the views of NRA members on background checks.\nWith all that in mind, we rate this statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/46e564bf-5dcc-4d20-999c-5e3306fa46e7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02366"}
