One conspiracy theory claims his COVID-19 diagnosis was actually a cover for something more nefarious.\u00a0\nIn a July 13 Facebook post, Hanks is pictured wearing a green bandana over his face. In two photos \u2014 close ups of his ankles \u2014\u00a0red circles are drawn around his right ankle.\u00a0\n\"Look who has a new ankle bracelet!\" the post says. \"Tom Hanks. Some of you don\u2019t know it but Mr. Hanks was arrested in Australia for pedophilia. He went on national TV to say he had COVID-19 and he was quarantine himself. Not true. He was in custody for a time then house arrest is n his hotel. Now, he\u2019s a flight risk.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nFirst of all, Hanks wasn\u2019t arrested in Australia for pedophilia. There\u2019s no evidence to support that and no news stories. If he had been charged with sex crimes against children, it would have been widely covered in the media.\u00a0\nOn March 11, the actor announced on Twitter that he and his wife, actor Rita Wilson, had tested positive for COVID-19. He said that they would follow the directions of medical officials.\u00a0\n\"We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires,\" he said. \"Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral days later, they were released from the hospital in Queensland, Australia, but remained in self-isolation while they recovered from the coronavirus.\u00a0\nBy March 28, American news outlets were reporting that Hanks and Wilson were both back stateside and had been photographed driving around Los Angeles, where they live.\u00a0\nThe Daily Mail published the photos of Hanks that appear in the Facebook post in May 2020. Captions of the images say Hanks is in Los Angeles, not Australia.\u00a0\n\"Despite already having beaten COVID-19, Tom Hanks wasn\u2019t willing to take any chance on Wednesday, with the Forrest Gump star covering his face with a green bandana when he ventured out in Los Angeles,\" one caption says.\u00a0\nThe story didn\u2019t mention him wearing an ankle bracelet (something else that would definitely draw the attention of reporters and the paparazzi). The area around his ankle looks more like a gathering of fabric from his pants.\nQAnon groups have pushed the unfounded claim that Hanks among other celebrities \u2014 like Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey \u2014\u00a0have been arrested in connection with a child sex trafficking ring. USA Today searched for both DeGeners and Hanks on California's sex offender registry and the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s national sex offender registry and found no records. Oprah responded publicly to the accusations.\u00a0\n\"NOT TRUE,\" she tweeted. \"Haven\u2019t been raided, or arrested. Just sanitizing and self distancing with the rest of the world. Stay safe everybody.\"\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17782"}
