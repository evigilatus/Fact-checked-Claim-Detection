I\u2019m counting on you.\"\nDuring his own presidential campaign, which ended in November, O\u2019Rourke called for mandatory buybacks of assault style weapons. He famously said during the Sept. 12 debate in Houston: \"Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\"\nOpponents of the proposal have taken O\u2019Rourke\u2019s endorsement, and Biden\u2019s comments about a possible leadership role for O\u2019Rourke, to mean that Biden now supports mandatory buybacks of assault style weapons \u2014 a policy he has not backed in the past.\nConservative-Daily, an online platform featuring articles with a conservative slant, said in a recent post that Biden has been explicit in his support of the buyback program, which has been equated with \"confiscation\" by gun rights advocates.\nThe post is titled \"Watch: Biden Looks Into The Camera And Promises To Take Away Americans\u2019 Guns\" and includes a 15-second clip cut from a longer Facebook live video of Biden and O\u2019Rourke talking with O\u2019Rourke\u2019s wife Amy O\u2019Rourke at a Whataburger after the Dallas rally.\nIn the clip, Biden says: \"This guy can change the face of what we\u2019re dealing with, with regard to guns, assault weapons, with regard to dealing with climate change. And I\u2019m just warning Amy: If I win, I\u2019m coming for him.\"\nThe post states that the video shows Biden agreeing to adopt O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \"most radical gun control proposals.\"\n\"This is a video of Joe Biden looking directly into the camera and promising to take away Americans\u2019 guns if elected,\" the post reads. \"And he had the audacity to make this promise in Texas \u2026\"\nWhen asked for clarification, Max McGuire, author of the post, said he heard Biden differently in the video.\nInstead of saying \"I\u2019m coming for him,\" McGuire said Biden can be heard saying, \"if he wins he is coming for \u2018em,\u2019 which we interpreted to mean guns, given the fact that seconds earlier he was praising Beto's gun control advocacy re: assault weapons.\"\nFor the record, multiple viewings of the video confirm that Biden is directing his remark to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s wife when he says: \"If I win, I\u2019m coming for him.\" He also gestures toward O\u2019Rourke.\nFactCheck.org also reviewed the video and reported that Biden said \"I\u2019m coming for him,\" in reference to O\u2019Rourke. The footage has been fact-checked by Reuters, which came to the same conclusion about Biden\u2019s remarks.\nNo role for O'Rourke in Biden's camp\nBut McGuire said if Biden had said \"I\u2019m coming for him,\" that means he plans to hire O\u2019Rourke to be part of his administration.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If he said 'coming for him,' we contend that there is no difference in intention,\" he said. \"Beto O'Rourke has made his gun control intentions clear. If he had been elected, he promised whole-heartedly that \u2018hell yes\u2019 he would be coming for Americans' guns. Joe Biden has since made his intention clear to have Beto run his campaign's and/or administration's gun control policy.\"\nBut that is inaccurate. Biden did say O\u2019Rourke would work with him on gun policy, but in an interview O\u2019Rourke said he does not have a role in Biden\u2019s campaign and that he has not spoken with Biden or his team about what role he could play in a future administration.\nO\u2019Rourke also said Biden has not expressed support for his gun safety policies.\n\"I have not heard him say he would support a mandatory buyback of assault weapons,\" O\u2019Rourke said.\nBiden\u2019s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment, so we turned to his platform on guns and recent public remarks he has made to assess whether his position on mandatory buybacks has shifted.\nBiden\u2019s platform on guns calls for a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high capacity magazines and the establishment of a voluntary program to buy back those weapons already in peoples\u2019 possession.\n\"This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act,\" his website reads.\nIn a heated exchange with an auto worker in Detroit on Tuesday, a week after receiving O\u2019Rourke\u2019s endorsement, Biden rejected the idea that he supported taking guns away from people.\nIn a video of the exchange, the man can be heard telling Biden: \"You are actively trying to diminish our Second Amendment right and take away our guns.\"\nBiden told the man that he was \"full of shit\" and added, \"I'm not taking your gun away \u2014 at all.\"\nThe man cited a video circulating online that shows Biden saying he is \"trying to take our guns.\"\nBiden responded: \"I did not say that. I did not say that. It\u2019s a viral video like the other ones they\u2019re putting out that are simply a lie.\"\nOur Ruling\nA blog post from Conservative Daily says a video of Biden and O\u2019Rourke at a burger joint in Texas shows Biden \"looking directly into the camera and promising to take away Americans\u2019 guns if elected.\"\nBiden does not say this in the video included in the blog post. The video shows Biden issuing a joking warning to Amy O\u2019Rourke, Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s wife, that if Biden is elected, he will be \"coming for him\" \u2014 meaning Beto O\u2019Rourke. O\u2019Rourke said he has no formal role in Biden\u2019s campaign and has not spoken with Biden\u2019s team about a job in a potential future administration.\nPlus the larger point here, that Biden now supports O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal for mandatory buybacks, is not accurate. Biden\u2019s platform on gun violence calls for a voluntary buyback program for assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18114"}
