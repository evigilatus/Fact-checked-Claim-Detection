President. Ever.\" This cover you may have seen going around Facebook isn't real.\nThe fake cover has a close-up portrait of Trump, with the special effect of his profile morphing into a skull. Below the magazine\u2019s iconic red logo are large white letters that say \"Worst. President. Ever.\" The subhead says: \"How DONALD TRUMP\" has disgraced the highest office in the nation,\" with more name-calling thrown in.\nTime has featured Trump on its cover several times before and after his presidential victory. But there is no record of this cover in Time\u2019s vault.\nAs our fact-checking friends at Snopes noted, the fake cover has been circulating on social media since at least November 2017. The \"worst\" president cover has a fabricated twin with a counter message about Trump: \"Best. President.
