Rick Perry, who plans to say this spring if he\u2019ll again seek the Republican presidential nomination, questioned the validity of federal unemployment statistics as he otherwise extolled the boom in his home state, according to a reporter in attendance.\nIn a tweet, Dave Weigel of Bloomberg Politics quoted Perry saying during a Jan. 26, 2015, breakfast event with Jewish voters in Des Moines that the official unemployment rate is unreliable: \"It\u2019s been massaged, it\u2019s been doctored,\" Weigel quoted Perry saying.\n\nBy phone, Weigel told us Perry made his remark while celebrating his state\u2019s economy and did not take reporter questions.\nAt our request, Weigel later emailed us his fuller transcript showing Perry said: \"We've got the lowest participation rate since the late 1970s when Jimmy Carter was president. I'm talking about participation in the work force. That's of really great concern for me.\"\nPerry continued: \"I mean, who is it standing up for these people that I call the uncounted? They've lost hope that they can even get a job, so they're not even counted. When you look at the unemployment rate today, that's not the true unemployment rate, it's been massaged, it's been doctored,\" Perry said.\nThe U.S. unemployment rate was 5.6 percent in December 2014, down from as much as 10 percent in 2009, Democrat Barack Obama\u2019s first year as president. The Texas jobless rate was 4.6 percent, the state\u2019s lowest since May 2008. Indeed, on Jan. 15, 2015, in his last speech to Texas legislators as governor, Perry saluted the state\u2019s job gains, also noting the Texas jobless rate was \"significantly below the national average.\"\nSo we were curious what he meant about the rate being doctored and asked Perry aides to elaborate--without success.\nJobless rate an imperfect indicator\nNationally, the persistence of discouraged workers and declining workforce participation often come up as criticisms of the jobless rate.\nPerry\u2019s mention of the official jobless rate leaving out discouraged workers was accurate.\nAfter Obama\u2019s latest State of the Union address, PolitiFact rated Mostly True the Democratic leader\u2019s declaration the unemployment rate was the lowest it had been since before the financial crisis that blew up around the time of his 2008 election.\nStill, that fact check noted Obama was citing the most basic version of the unemployment rate, which draws on regular surveys of households that originated in 1940. Another version of the rate, known as U-6, tries to capture a broader picture of labor-market weaknesses by accounting for people who are unemployed plus people working part-time who would rather have full-time work -- and people who have stopped looking for work but would begin to look again if labor-market conditions improved. By rolling in these additional factors, the U-6 rate tends to track the official unemployment rate but is usually a few points higher.\nAnd as it happens, the U-6 rate -- unlike the official unemployment rate -- hasn\u2019t returned to its pre-financial-crisis level. The national December 2014 U-6 rate was 11.2 percent, higher than the 11 percent rate in September 2008.\nThis gets us to Perry\u2019s mention of labor force participation, which gauges the number of people in the labor force compared to the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The labor force shrinks whenever someone retires, voluntarily gives up working (such as when they become a full-time parent or go back to school full-time) or because they simply give up on finding a job.\nHistorically, workforce participation was down in the national recession at the end of Carter\u2019s tenure and through the start of Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency, PolitiFact noted in 2012.\nMore recently, the labor force participation rate has markedly decreased since 2008. In September 2008, it stood at 66 percent; it was nearly 63 percent as of December 2014, the most recent month of available data. So, the participation rate is lately at its lowest point since the late 1970s, which also was a time when fewer women had jobs outside the home. This decrease has partly been influenced by the aging of the workforce (as in Baby Boomer retirements).\nNo signs of doctoring\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

As a statistical agency, the Census Bureau is very conscientious about our responsibility to produce accurate Current Population Survey data for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and all other surveys we conduct.\"\nThe bureau referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, which said in May 2014 it had found \"no evidence\" unemployment data had been manipulated in the months leading up to the November 2012 national election. That report also recommended some bureau reforms.\nNone of several experts responding to our inquiries said the unemployment rate has been massaged or doctored.\nAmong them, Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute told us the fact the regular jobless rate doesn\u2019t reflect discouraged job-seekers or part-timers wishing for full-time jobs isn\u2019t a deliberate government misrepresentation. Still, Biggs emailed, it means the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t deliver an accurate picture of the labor market\u2019s health. \"If labor force participation were the same today as prior to the recession, I believe the unemployment rate would be around 8.3%. So the idea that the labor market is really healthy today just isn\u2019t that true,\" he said.\nIn 2013, economists told PolitiFact it would be extremely difficult to alter the unemployment rate.\nWilliam Shobe, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Studies at the University of Virginia, said it\u2019s important to remember there are many measures of unemployment, including privately produced surveys. \"And they all agree, within the margins of error,\" Shobe said. \"The immediate conclusion that you can draw from that is that no rogue interviewer or group of rogue interviewers have managed to budge the unemployment far (or at all, mind you) from the value it would have had otherwise.\"\nShobe added that any effort to fudge the national numbers would require the participation of interviewers across the country. \"Otherwise you would see only a localized move which would wash out as noise in the national stats,\" he said.\nShobe, reached afresh for this story, said he was unaware of developments that would support the former governor\u2019s claim. \"The whole idea that you could get a group of these statisticians to lie about these survey results they\u2019re collecting and have that stick, that\u2019s just crazy,\" Shobe said.\"These are career civil servants. Their incentives are to get the best possible numbers.\"\nShobe suggested we query University of Wisconsin economist Menzie Chinn who told us by email that he considers such critiques of the rate to be \"specious;\" Chinn pointed us to his October 2012 blog post taking to task a similar statement by business executive Jack Welch.\nAsked to assess Perry\u2019s comment in full, Chinn said: \"It\u2019s true that had the labor force participation rate not declined, and we used the number of employed actually observed to calculate a rate, then mechanically the unemployment rate would have to be higher.\" Regardless, he said, it\u2019s not so that government statisticians changed the procedure for calculations in order to change the reported unemployment number \u2013 which Chinn said is how he would define \"doctored.\"\nBy phone, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, said nothing notable has occurred to demonstrate the unemployment rate has been doctored or massaged, though in August 2014, Princeton University economist Alan Krueger and others wrote a paper pointing out fewer people are responding to the survey that feeds the rate. A New York Times columnist, David Leonhardt, summarized the upshot as being a seeming \"increase in the number of people who once would have qualified as officially unemployed and today are considered out of the labor force, neither working nor looking for work.\"\nSinclair speculated by email that Perry\u2019s reference to discouraged workers being left out of the rate means he\u2019d prefer to see the rate calculated with the workers counted. But the words \"massaged\" and \"doctored,\" Sinclair said, each carries a charge, implying the rate is nefariously manipulated. \"We have no evidence of that,\" Sinclair said.\nOur ruling\nAddressing Iowans, Perry said the official U.S. jobless rate \"has been doctored, it\u2019s been massaged.\"\nThere\u2019s legitimate debate about what statistic best measures the state of the workforce and even agreement that the widely quoted unemployment rate (which Perry stressed as meaningful about a week before this Iowa stop) doesn\u2019t provide the fullest picture of the labor force. But that's a far cry from showing the government is massaging or doctoring numbers, which implies organized underhanded wrongdoing.\nPerry may yet elaborate. We find this claim factually unsupported and ridiculous.
