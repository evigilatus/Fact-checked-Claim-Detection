He has consistently supported increased restrictions on abortion and opposed federal funding for stem-cell research.\n\n\nRomney says he is pro-life, but acknowledges that he has not been consistent on the issue over the years.\n\n\nIn his 1994 Senate race against incumbent Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Romney said in a televised debate, \"I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country . . . I believe that since Roe V. Wade has been the law for twenty years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law, and support the right of a woman to make that choice. \"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRomney reiterated his position in his 2002 campaign for governor, saying \"I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.\"\n\n\nRomney said he changed his mind on abortion after meeting with a Harvard stem-cell researcher in 2004.\n\n\nIn July 2005, he wrote in a Boston Globe op-ed, \"I am pro-life. I believe that abortion is the wrong choice except in cases of incest, rape, and to save the life of the mother. I wish the people of America agreed, and that the laws of our nation could reflect that view. But while the nation remains so divided over abortion, I believe that the states, through the democratic process, should determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate.\"\n\n\nBrownback's statement about Romney would have been true if he had referred to the former governor's past position. But since Brownback was clear that it was present-tense, we find the claim to be false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16620"}
