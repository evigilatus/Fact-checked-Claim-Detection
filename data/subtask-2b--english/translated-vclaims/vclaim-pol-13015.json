He got a listener, not all of it from the business community. When the forum ended, Kantor faced some angry women, and one of them screamed as she approached. They bothered Cantor with the questions, and they didn't like the answers, one of them, a liberal activist with Moo On.org, threw insults. Another woman took a different bag. She explained to Cantor that one of her friends had recently accepted a government post in Washington and was receiving fuel subsidies for mobility. As the price of gas rose, the woman asked why she should also not receive fuel subsidies. Cantor replied that there was injustice between federal government and private sector employees and was determined to correct it. \"If you look at the benefits and wages of registered federal employees, they far exceed the market prices of the private sector,\" he said. Really? We thought it was worth a look. In support of the claim, the Cantor Office sent a number of sources, including the investigation widely referred to in 2010 on federal pay for private wages from the United States of America today. The press probe relied on 2009 data (still the latest available data) from the Federal Bureau for Economic Analysis. It showed that federal civil servants received wages and benefits on average of $123,049 while private sector workers received a total compensation of $61,051. According to the United States of America today, federal civil servants received an average salary of $81,258 and benefits of $41,791. Private sector workers received $50,462 in wages and $10,589 in benefits. Officials from unions of public officials and some economists reject wage comparisons. They say that the gap reflects the increasing level of skills and education required for most federal jobs, and the Government is contracting many less paid jobs with the private sector. Another report from the United States of America today focused on salaries alone. The wages of 40 occupations in 2008 were compared with both the federal government and the private sector, as defined in the data of the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Federal employees received an average salary of US$ 67,691, while private sector employees in the same group of jobs received an average of US$ 60,046. This is a difference of $7,645. However, there are arguments on the other side when it comes to payment alone. :: Late last year, an annual report from the Bureau of Labour Statistics to the Federal Wages Council found that the wages of federal civil workers were on average 2.1 per cent lower than those of private sector workers. But as some of our friends pointed out in Factcheck.org late last year, experts say that there are flaws in the methodology there that prevent a real comparison between apples and apples. In a 1990 detailed report on wage differentials, written recently in the Executive Government Journal, the administrative adviser, Howard Richer, has no way of knowing which sector is actually receiving higher salaries because \"there is no detailed comparison between work and employment to support their arguments.\" All this is good and good, but it still has no impact on Cantor's claim, which looks at both wages and benefits. All parties agree that federal benefits are much more generous than those of the private sector. According to Gary Portless, an economist working with the left Brookings Institution, there are good reasons why federal employees get better compensation for private sector employees. Federal employees usually performed more specialized work that required greater education and responsibility than their private sector counterparts. Federal workers had often served longer than private employees. Bertless said that \"it is surprising that federal workers receive higher average compensation than the average wages of private sector workers when they are told that school teachers are paid more than McDonald's employees.\" However, as shown by the study conducted by the United States of America today, federal wages are higher than those of the private sector in four out of five job categories in both sectors. These included accountants, nurses, chemists, public relations specialists, surveyors, cooks, clerks and janitors. As Chris Edwards, economist at the Liberal Cato Institute, noted, federal wages have risen faster than those of the private sector in recent years, despite stagnation. \"The EPA data show that the federal average salary rose by 58 per cent between 2000 and 2009, which was much faster than the 30 per cent increase in the private sector,\" Edwards wrote. Let's look back. Cantor alleges that the \"benefits and wages\" of federal employees far exceed those of the private sector. This is true on average; the total compensation for federal workers is almost double the average for the private sector. Looking at salary alone narrows the gap slightly, and some argue that private pay exceeds federal pay, but Cantor plays it safely by avoiding specific figures and including benefits. As some suggest, there may be strong reasons for inequality - experience, educational requirements, responsibility and seniority - but this does not change the facts. We're assessing the claim right.
