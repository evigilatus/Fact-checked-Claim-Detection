Rick Scott bragged that his final state budget continues a trend of record funding for education.\n\"For the sixth straight year, we have secured record funding for K-12 and state universities to ensure every student has the opportunity to receive a world-class education in Florida,\" Scott wrote in a letter to Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner on March 16.\nScott\u2019s claim is at odds with Democrats and state educators who say the education budget doesn\u2019t go far enough to cover classroom needs. The 2018-19 budget includes specific allotments for school safety and mental health programs in response to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.\nGiven the heated debate, we wanted to take a closer look at Scott\u2019s claim. As we\u2019ve concluded in similar fact-checks, the state\u2019s total K-12 education budget has indeed increased in raw dollars every year for the last six years.\nHowever, Scott is overstating the value of those dollars. The K-12 education budget has not topped pre-recession levels when adjusted for inflation.\nBreakdown of K-12 education funding\nThe main source of money for K-12 education is the Florida Education Finance Program, or FEFP. By law, it\u2019s a combination of state and local funding that is sometimes tweaked based on tax receipts and enrollment counts.\nScott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said the \"record funding\" for K-12 education is only in reference to the state contribution, not the total funds that factor in local contributions. But that was not clear from Scott\u2019s comment.\nFor the 2018-19 school year, the K-12 total budget is about $21.1 billion, or about $7,408 per student. (The state\u2019s share is a little more than half of the total at $11.9 billion.)\nThat\u2019s the highest it\u2019s ever been, and a jump of almost $500 million from the previous year.\nSchool officials around the state have not been pleased, however, because their hands are tied about how to spend most of it. \u00a0\nA good chunk of the\u00a0increase is dedicated for school safety and mental health initiatives. \"The Legislature is touting \u2018record\u2019 funding for schools by counting money slated for safety and mental health, not for education,\" said superintendents from some of Florida\u2019s largest school districts in a joint column for the Tampa Bay Times. \"Their \u2018record\u2019 funding is all funneled into categorical funds and can only be used for certain purposes.\"\nWith that point in mind, we dove into the budget and per-pupil spending trends (the past six years are in bold):\n\n\n\n\nFiscal year\n\n\nTotal K-12 state share\n\n\nTotal K-12 funds\n\n\nK-12 enrollment\n\n\nPer-pupil spending\n\n\n\n\n2007-08\n\n\n$9.7 billion\n\n\n$18.7 billion\n\n\n2.63 million\n\n\n$7,126\n\n\n\n\n2008-09\n\n\n$8.6 billion\n\n\n$17.9 billion\n\n\n2.62 million\n\n\n$6,846\n\n\n\n\n2009-10\n\n\n$8.1 billion\n\n\n$18 billion\n\n\n2.63 million\n\n\n$6,846\n\n\n\n\n2010-11\n\n\n$8.91 billion\n\n\n$18.2 billion\n\n\n2.64 million\n\n\n$6,897\n\n\n\n\n2011-12*\n\n\n$8.71 billion\n\n\n$16.6 billion\n\n\n2.67 million\n\n\n$6,217\n\n\n\n\n2012-13\n\n\n$9.5 billion\n\n\n$17.2 billion\n\n\n2.7 million\n\n\n$6,376\n\n\n\n\n2013-14\n\n\n$10.5 billion\n\n\n$18.3 billion\n\n\n2.705 million\n\n\n$6,769\n\n\n\n\n2014-15\n\n\n$10.7 billion\n\n\n$18.9 billion\n\n\n2.74 million\n\n\n$6,915\n\n\n\n\n2015-16\n\n\n$10.93 billion\n\n\n$19.7 billion\n\n\n2.77 million\n\n\n$7,105\n\n\n\n\n2016-17\n\n\n$11.3 billion\n\n\n$20.2 billion\n\n\n2.8 million\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$7,196\n\n\n\n\n2017-18\n\n\n$11.6 billion\n\n\n$20.6 billion\n\n\n2.82 million\n\n\n$7,307\n\n\n\n\n2018-19\n\n\n$11.9 billion\n\n\n$21.1 billion\n\n\n2.9 million\n\n\n$7,408\n\n\n\n\n* Scott\u2019s first budget.\nIn sheer dollars, Scott\u2019s claim about K-12 schools is accurate. \u00a0Overall, state and per-pupil funding has increased every year since fiscal year 2013-14 in K-12 schools.\nPer-pupil spending is a crucial measure, because it shows how much is spent on each student. It would be expected, then, that overall spending would increase with the number of students. There are approximately 200,000 more K-12 students today then six years ago in fiscal year 2013-14.\nScott\u2019s boast of record funding, however, does not hold up when adjusted for inflation.\nUsing the federal Consumer Price Index calculator, we found per-pupil spending is not as high as it was before the recession crippled state tax revenues.\nK-12 per-pupil spending would have to be more than $8,726 in 2018-19 to match the 2007-08 level. Instead it is more than $1,000 short.\nState university funding\nScott\u2019s boasts of education spending over the years have not usually included state funding for universities. Scott\u2019s office provided the total operating budgets for state universities in the six years he mentioned, but we were unable to find per-pupil and enrollment totals for the more recent school years.\nThe university budgets grew each year, from $3.48 billion in 2013-14 to $4.37 billion from 2018-19. During that time, the system also added more students.\nThe Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System, offered enrollment totals and per-pupil spending for this period, using a slightly different methodology to calculate the overall operating funds.\nThe spending totals reported by the board are slightly less than the figures cited by Scott. (One explanation could be that the governor\u2019s data includes tuition assistance.) Still, they speak to the trend of increased record spending.\nThe same caveats we found with K-12 education also apply: Per-pupil spending in 2018-19 would have to be roughly $14,346 to match the 2007-08 level.\nWe did not find a per-pupil spending for 2018-19, but it\u2019s safe to say that the per-pupil amount would be very close to the spending power in 2007-08.\n\n\n\n\nFiscal year\n\n\nGeneral revenue and lottery subtotal\n\n\nEnrollment\n\n\nPer-pupil spending\n\n\n\n\n2007-08\n\n\n$3.04 billion\n\n\n259,528\n\n\n$11,716\n\n\n\n\n2008-09\n\n\n$2.9 billion\n\n\n259,972\n\n\n$11,407\n\n\n\n\n2009-10\n\n\n$2.9 billion\n\n\n268,052\n\n\n$11,015\n\n\n\n\n2010-11\n\n\n$3.1 billion\n\n\n276,376\n\n\n$11,324\n\n\n\n\n2011-12*\n\n\n$2.9 billion\n\n\n293,660\n\n\n$10,162\n\n\n\n\n2012-13\n\n\n$2.9 billion\n\n\n294,005\n\n\n$9,906\n\n\n\n\n2013-14\n\n\n$3.5 billion\n\n\n293,517\n\n\n$11,957\n\n\n\n\n2014-15\n\n\n$3.8 billion\n\n\n294,785\n\n\n$12,764\n\n\n\n\n2015-16\n\n\n$3.9 billion\n\n\n299,486\n\n\n$13,047\n\n\n\n\n2016-17\n\n\n$4.1 billion\n\n\n305,690\n\n\n$13,459\n\n\n\n\n2017-18\n\n\n$4.28 billion\n\n\n311,430\n\n\n$13,752\n\n\n\n\n2018-19\n\n\n$4.3 billion*\n\n\nNo data\n\n\nNo data\n\n\n\n\nSource: Board of Governors,\u00a0State Funding History for the SUS\n*Governor\u2019s office estimate\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\nScott said, \"For the sixth straight year, we have secured record funding for K-12 and state universities.\"\nScott has a point in terms of sheer dollars. However, Florida's K-12 education funding hasn\u2019t kept up with pre-recession numbers. We don't have a complete view of state university spending, but it's likely per-pupil spending is roughly the same as pre-recession numbers.\u00a0\nAnd the bulk of this year\u2019s K-12 education budget increase is strictly for school safety and mental health, which won\u2019t leave a lot of money left over for classroom needs.\nWe rate this Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-23 15:36:47 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"For the sixth straight year, we have secured record funding for K-12 and state universities.\"     Rick Scott Governor https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SPR-BIZHUBa18031613360.pdf   in a letter Friday, March 16, 2018 2018-03-16    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02273"}
