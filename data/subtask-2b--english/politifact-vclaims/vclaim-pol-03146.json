Minnesota, however, is not among these places.\nNevertheless, fake news sites like Political Mayhem claim Minnesota recently passed an Islamic anti-blasphemy law dressed up to look like a municipal hate crime hotline.\n\"It is not the way we roll in America, until now,\" reads one noxious fake news item. \"Minnesota has just established\" an anti-blasphemy law.\nWe decided to hose off this dumpster fire.\nA hate crime hotline is not an anti-blasphemy law \nDefining blasphemy is easy enough:\u00a0in legal terms it\u2019s \"any oral or written reproach maliciously cast upon God, His name, attributes, or religion.\"\nBut it strains credulity beyond the breaking point to believe\u00a0a hate crime hotline set up June 19 by the city of Minneapolis is actually an Islamic anti-blasphemy law.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, opening a hotline is not how you make law.\nSecond, this hotline is not meant for suspected crimes against Muslims only.\nAs a statement describing the new service makes clear, reports concerning \"any crime against a person or property motivated by prejudice against someone\u2019s race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity\" are encouraged.\nThird, even if this hotline were law (it\u2019s not), anti-blasphemy laws are unenforceable in the United States because blasphemy is considered protected speech under the Constitution.\nTo suss out the raison d\u2019etre of this fake news article, look no further than its inflammatory headline, which reads, \"State Of Minnesota Has Just Handed Over FULL CONTROL To Muslims So They Can Take Down \u2018Infidels.\u2019 \"\nThis calculated effort to stoke Islamophobia among credulous readers at a moment when reports show anti-Muslim hate crimes have risen across the country is dangerous.\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-07-03 16:28:42 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Minnesota imposed an Islamic anti-blasphemy law    Internet rumors Bloggers   Internet posts Saturday, June 24, 2017 2017-06-24    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03146"}
