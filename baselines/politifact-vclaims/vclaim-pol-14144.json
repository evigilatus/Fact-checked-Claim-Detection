Hurt is one of seven challengers in Virginia congressional races -- six Republicans and one independent -- to take the pledge, which the anti-tax group enforces strictly.\n\nThe pledge for House candidates has two parts: They promise to oppose any increase in marginal income tax rates for citizens or businesses, and they vow to oppose the elimination of tax deductions or credits unless they are offset \"dollar for dollar\" by tax cuts or new credits.\n\nSimple enough. But it has given Democrats an opening to make a dubious connection to tax credits they portray as loopholes for shipping American jobs offshore.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has translated the second part of the pledge to mean that signers support tax loopholes for multinational companies operating in other countries. The DCCC backs up the claim not with the pledge the candidates actually signed, but with three specific bills opposed by Americans for Tax Reform that the group urged pledge signers to oppose. One of them was the $26.1 billion bill adopted in August to help states hire teachers and pay for Medicaid services. The money for those programs would come from closing the loopholes. Hurt opposed that bill, citing the increase in federal spending.\n\nDemocrats say the money from closing the loopholes was well-spent. \"Our point is if you\u2019re going to spend the money, it should be on creating jobs here,\" Jesse F. Ferguson, the DCCC\u2019s southern region press secretary, told us.\n\nBut the fact that someone signed the pledge doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are opposed to closing loopholes for off-shore companies.\n\nOur friends at FactCheck.org have been knocking down this claim since April, when the DCCC ran a TV ad against a Republican House candidate in Hawaii. They recently debunked the same claim in an ad in the Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The taxpayer pledge doesn\u2019t prevent a signer from opposing any tax break as long as he or she finds a way to offset the resulting increase in taxes.\n\n\"The pledge doesn\u2019t get into whether something is good or bad tax policy,\" Ryan Ellis, ATR\u2019s director of tax policy, told us. The pledge means that if a bill would result in a net tax increase, \"you\u2019re not free to vote for it,\" Ellis said.\n\nHurt hasn\u2019t offered specifics about his position on the offshore tax rules, but in a TV ad last month, he called Perriello\u2019s claim false.\n\nWe agree. Perriello has chosen to rest his claim on the DCCC\u2019s spurious connection to the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, but that is a huge leap of logic and it doesn\u2019t prove Hurt supports the offshore loopholes. So we find the claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14144"}
