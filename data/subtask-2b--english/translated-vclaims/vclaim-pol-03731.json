In 2013, a judge sentenced Manning, a soldier of the United States Army, to 35 years &apos; imprisonment, and sentenced him to an unprecedented term of imprisonment for leaking government information, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In January 2017, Obama decided to lighten her sentence. She will leave prison in May. In an interview with Fox News Host Bill O'Reilly on January 18, 2017, McCain asked about his reaction to Obama's decision. McCain said that he felt \"to return to the families of those individuals who knew in these leaks in Afghanistan that the Taliban had pursued and killed them. And anger because this president basically supports a proposal that allows someone to go free and that is responsible for the unnecessary death of those people who are allies.\" O'Reilly retracted McCain's assertion that individuals identified in the leaks had been killed by the Taliban. \"I just wanted to know if the specific leaks that came to you as a senator who showed what WikiLeaks did with Manning's help killed people who were helping the United States,\" said O'Reily. McCain answered: \"Let me be specific. The information I received when I was there that the Taliban went after these people. I suppose, kill them.\" The interview still wonders whether people were killed because their names appeared in the documents leaked by Manning, so we decided to place McCain's claim on the Treaty-O-Meter. The spokesman for McCain Julie Tarlow said that the Taliban had a history of reprisals against people who cooperated with United States forces. She referred to an interview in 2010 by British television channel IV with a Taliban spokesman, who said that the group would punish Afghan citizens working for the United States mentioned in the WikiLeaks records. \"If they're American spies, then we know how to punish them,\" said the spokesman, Zbilah Mujahid. However, we have found no evidence that the Taliban acted on these threats. We examined court documents, congressional minutes and media reports, and found that the government did not mention anyone who was killed because he or she was named in leaked files. In 2010, Manning, then known as Bradley Manning, was an army analyst in Iraq. She downloaded about 700,000 government files and gave many of them to WikiLeaks, who made the files public. The records included diplomatic cables, reports of the United States Detention Facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, in particular a video of an attack by an American helicopter in Baghdad in 2007 that resulted in the death of civilians. The Government expressed concern that the Taliban or other opponents might respond to foreign nationals whose names were included in the documents because individuals cooperated with the United States. However, officials never mentioned an example of a person being killed by leaks. The closest contact came in August 2013, during the Maning trial sentencing phase, when the Government attempted to claim that Manning leaks caused damage. Robert Carr, the retired Dean of the United States Army who led an investigation into the leak, testified that he knew \"one person killed\" by the Taliban as a result of the leaks. However, Car admitted that the person killed had not been named in the documents submitted by Manning to WikiLeaks. As a result, the judge decided to withdraw the certificate from the register. In this regard, an exchange of views (from an unofficial version provided by the Freedom of the Press Foundation): Kar: \"As a result of Afghan records, I know only one person who was killed. The individual was an Afghan citizen. The Afghan citizen had a relationship with the Government of the United States and the Taliban who went out in public and said that they had killed him as a result of his association with information in these records.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 Major Thomas Hurley's defense attorney: \"Ma'am, we may once again object to the importance of the matter. General Carr is going to talk about how this person wasn't included in the WikiLeaks revelation. This person &apos; s name was not included among those names, among the hundreds of names he spoke of.\" Judge Dennis Lynde: \"Is this, as you testify, linked to information in any way to disclosure?\" Kar: \"The Taliban killed him and tied him to the revelations. We went back and looked for this guy's name in all the information. The name wasn't there. It was a terrorist act on behalf of the Taliban that threatened all others there. But the name of the person killed was not in the disclosure.\" So the Taliban said they killed someone because of WikiLeaks' records, but the records didn't actually mention that person. Car said he only knew this example. In his closing arguments at Manning's sentencing trial, the Government's lead attorney, Ashden Finn, said only that leaks put hundreds of people \"at risk of injury, imprisonment or death as a result of the release of their names.\" He didn't argue that anyone actually died. It should be noted that part of the Maning trial was held in closed session to discuss confidential information. So it's possible that the deaths directly caused by Manning leaks have occurred, and we can't know what didn't declassify that information. David Coombs, attorney of Manning, attended the private hearings. He told us that the Government had not provided any evidence that individuals had been killed as a direct result of the leaks. \"This information never came out because it didn't exist,\" said Combs, \"McKen's claim is totally fake.\" Finn, lead government lawyer in this case, refused to speak to us in the record. If not death, what harm did Manning leaks do to national security? The Government has repeatedly stated that the main effect is a \"shaky effect\" - in the sense that foreign officials and citizens are less likely to speak and cooperate with American soldiers and diplomats. However, Obama &apos; s administrators indicated that leaks did not actually cause much damage. \"I've heard the effect of these releases on our foreign policy, which has been described as a collapse, a change factor in the game, and so forth. I think these descriptions are somewhat exaggerated,\" said former Defence Minister Robert Gates in 2010, plus later, \"Is this embarrassing? Yeah. Is it embarrassing? Yeah. Consequences for U.S. foreign policy? In an interview in December 2010 about NBC, former Vice President Joe Biden said about WikiLeaks, \"I don't think there's any substantial damage, no. See, some cables that come in here and around the world are embarrassing.\" Our referee, McKeen, said the Taliban were followed and killed by people identified in Chelsea Manning's leaks. In the many years since WikiLeaks issued hundreds of thousands of government documents leaked by Manning, the Government has not publicly identified one example of the Taliban killing someone because the person was named in the leaks. If a person has died as a result, it seems logical that the incident has become known to the public, either through the Manning trial or in media reports. In the Maning sentencing trial, an army witness said that he knew that the Taliban had killed one person and blamed what had been revealed by the WikiLeaks. However, the name of that person does not appear in the files, and no additional information has been provided by the military. We're assessing McCain's claim mostly wrong. Update: This article has been updated to include more information from McKeen staff. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e3caae4-5952-441f1-bb7e-3cde8f9a3f29", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03731"}
