We have reviewed a number of exaggerated allegations from both sides about the implications of the progressive rate structure, which is supported by the Government. P. Pritzker was opposed by Republican legislators and prominent government business groups. With the question addressed to the ballot boxes next year, both supporters and critics have a lot of time to continue defending their cause in favour of or against the abolition of the State fixed income tax, which is currently set at 4.95 per cent. Several days before the adoption of the legislative measure, a group of legislators in the Republican Council held a press conference to express their concerns. One of the interns who spoke against the plan referred to New York as a warning story, citing remarks from the Democratic Governor of that state. \"Goff. [Andrew] Como from New York said, \"The tax of the rich, the tax of the rich, the tax of the rich. \"God forbid rich leave,\" said Mike Murphy from Springfield. \"When they implemented a program similar to this, they had a 2 to 3% decrease in their expectations (revenues) due to emigration to their largest owners.\" We confirmed with Murphy that he was referring to the comments made by Como in early February when he announced that tax collection in New York came from less than $2.3 billion in projections for December and January. When we spoke to Murphy on the phone, he told us that he had obtained his information from an editorial published by the Investor Business Daily in February. This article focused on warning Kumu that asking the richest New Yorkers to push more was pushing them to withdraw from low-tax states. What Murphy neglected to mention during the press conference was that Como was not critical of the progressive income tax structure of his country. Indeed, Como's remarks were aimed at what was thought to be the effects of economic uncertainty, such as the volatility of stock markets, as well as the new restrictions imposed by the Republican-led federal tax reform in 2017 on the possibility of deducting government and domestic income taxes. Murphy said after we explained that New York State income tax rates had not changed significantly in a decade. \"Perhaps\" would have been a better word. However, this argument is no better because Komo himself did not provide any evidence of the supposed mass migration he described. The only filers in New York pay at least 6.85 per cent of the income in excess of $215,400, according to the Tax Corporation. In Illinois, legislators are currently considering a bill that will introduce higher income rates of more than $250,000 if voters agree to constitutional change. Under that plan, which Murphy opposes, Illinois, which receives more than $750,000 a year, will impose a rate of 7.99 per cent on its entire income. At the same time, New York applies its highest rate of 8.82 per cent to income in excess of $1.07 million. Since New York raised State taxes on higher-level income in 2009 to help fill the budget deficit, the number of federal tax reporters in that state, with incomes above $200,000, has increased annually, as data from the Internal Revenue Service show. There were approximately 600,210 filers reporting the highest income in 2016, the latest year for which data were available, than in 2006, before the major recession, when higher wage rates were lower. In fact, Kevin McCarthy had stated in a press release issued on February 9, 2021 that raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour \"will destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.\" Chris Nichols's February 11, 2021 warning, based on evidence admitted by his administration, was unclear. \"Evidentiary evidence indicates that high-income taxpayers are thinking of changing their place of residence and that financial industry companies are looking at real estate outside New York,\" read a slide in their February presentation. The Comptroller in New York noted that collections could improve with government tax payments in April, a forecast that proved accurate. New York revenue declined by $3.7 billion for the year ended 31 March, with records showing, but by April with annual tax returns, there were clear signs of recovery. Income from personal income tax in New York increased by 57 per cent in April of the same month in 2018, according to a report by the Dinapoli Office. We have looked into Murphy's claim by the government finance expert David Mereman, who questioned the broader link that Murphy sought to establish between high tax rates on higher income earners and foreign migration. \"As far as we know, there is very little movement in response to these tax rates on very high-income groups,\" said Mereman, who chairs the financial future project at the University of Illinois and recently participated in the preparation of a report summarizing academic evidence on the subject. A recent analysis by a better government association also revealed that the number of high-income tax reporters in Illinois increased over a period several years ago when the fixed income tax rate in Illinois jumped to a record level of 67 per cent. This has happened despite warnings from critics that the tax hike will lead to a massive exodus of wealthy taxpayers from Illinois. :: Judging by the remarks made by the Governor of New York in February, Murphy claimed that when that state \"implemented a program\" to tax the rich at higher rates, he would be able to find a way out of the country. Como raised the spectre of emigration among better-off taxpayers in the country when personal income tax revenues were projected earlier this year. However, he blamed the fall resulting from the Federal Republican Tax Reform in 2017 and other factors, not on the income tax rates graduated in New York that had not been raised for a decade. Furthermore, data from the Internal Revenue Service show that the number of people applying for more than $200,000 in New York has increased each year since 2009, when New York raised higher income rates to levels similar to those currently under consideration in Illinois. We're appreciating Murphy's false claim. It's wrong that the phrase isn't accurate.
