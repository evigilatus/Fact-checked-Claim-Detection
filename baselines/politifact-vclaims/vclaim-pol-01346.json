Duncan Hunter represents a solidly Republican district, but he was indicted in August for misusing campaign funds. This has given a boost to his previously longshot Democratic challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar, who is of Palestinian and Mexican ancestry. A recent poll by the independent firm SurveyUSA had Hunter with only a three-point lead.\nHunter has attracted national attention \u2014 and criticism \u2014 for rhetoric that seeks to paint Campa-Najjar as someone who has ties to Islamist terrorists.\n\"Ammar Campa-Najjar is working to infiltrate Congress,\" says one ad by Hunter\u2019s campaign. \"He\u2019s used three different names to hide his family\u2019s ties to terrorism. His grandfather masterminded the Munich Olympic massacre. His father said they deserved to die.\"\nThe ad then plays video aired by the conservative One America News Network: \"A Palestinian-Mexican American doesn\u2019t get his support from the people of San Diego.\u2019 \u2018He is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.\u2019 \u2018This is a well-orchestrated plan.\u2019\" The ad closes, \"Ammar Campa-Najjar: A risk we can\u2019t ignore.\"\n\n\u00a0\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker looked at various elements of this ad as well as separate remarks delivered by Hunter and gave them a collective Four Pinocchios, the worst possible rating. (Campa-Najjar, for instance, never knew his grandfather, his father\u2019s comment was not that straightforward, and he was raised by his mother\u2019s Mexican-American family.)\nHere, we\u2019ll zero in on one particular claim in the advertisement \u2014 that Campa-Najjar \"is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.\" CAIR refers to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington-based group whose mission is to \"enhance understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.\nThe assertion about the support for Campa-Najjar\u2019s campaign is not accurate.\nDespite Hunter\u2019s continued invocation of radical Islam in the campaign, Campa-Najjar is actually a Christian of long standing.\nIn a statement provided by Campa-Najjar\u2019s campaign, Mike Meeks, pastor emeritus of EastLake Church, said, \"I have known Ammar since he was 16, when he became part of our youth ministry. Before he left for college, he grew up serving our janitorial staff, worship team, and youth ministry, where he even gave Sunday Youth group sermons. When he served in federal government, we talked regularly about life and the faith challenges of following Jesus in today\u2019s world. Through it all, Ammar remains committed to growing in his faith, following Jesus and serving his community.\"\nCampa-Najjar\u2019s campaign said that the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political organization in Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries, would deem him an apostate due to his Christianity.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, neither the Muslim Brotherhood nor CAIR are legally able to support a candidate.\nOver the years, the United States\u2019 relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood has ranged from uneasy tolerance to outright opposition.\nBut whatever the U.S. policy has been, the Muslim Brotherhood is a foreign organization, so as such, the group and its leaders are prohibited by federal law from making \"any contribution, expenditure or donation in any U.S. election.\"\nAs for CAIR, it is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Internal Revenue Service regulations say that 501(c)(3) groups are \"precluded from engaging in any political campaign activities.\"\nLaws aside, there is no evidence that either group has given money to Campa-Najjar. The most one could say is that a few CAIR volunteers have done so in their personal capacity.\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune cross-referenced records of donations made to Campa-Najjar with lists of CAIR board members and found that the candidate received 18 donations from seven people totaling $17,300. Through Oct. 31, Campa-Najjar had raised $3,168,975, meaning that the donations from CAIR board members accounted for about one half of 1 percent of his donations this cycle.\n\"None of the seven donors held paid positions with CAIR, according to public tax reports,\" the newspaper reported. \"Donors listed their primary employers and occupations \u2014 their day jobs \u2014 to identify themselves to the campaign as required by the FEC.\"\nFor instance, the Union-Tribune reached David Chami, an attorney who lives in Arizona and serves on the board of a local CAIR chapter. Chami told the newspaper \"that he is not paid by CAIR and that his contribution was independent and based solely on Campa-Najjar\u2019s position on consumer advocacy laws.\"\nHe added, \"My decision to help a particular candidate is based on their political positions and issues they support. It has nothing to do with religion and if it did, I\u2019m Muslim and he is a Christian.\"\nRobert S. McCaw, the director of government affairs for CAIR, told PolitiFact, \"We can confirm that CAIR or its chapters did not donate to or endorse Campa-Najjar. What staff or board members do on their own time is their own business.\"\u2019\nHunter\u2019s office did not respond to an inquiry.\nOur ruling\nHunter said, \"Ammar Campa-Najjar is working to infiltrate Congress\" and \"is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.\"\nNeither group can do so under federal law, and there is no evidence that they have broken the law to donate to his campaign. Campa-Najjar has received more than a dozen personal donations from people who happen to be CAIR volunteers. We could find no connection to the Muslim Brotherhood.\nThis is an unsubstantiated accusation that rests on fear-mongering.\u00a0We rate the statement Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-01 16:22:52 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says \"Ammar Campa-Najjar is working to infiltrate Congress\" and \"is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.\"    Duncan Hunter U.S. Representative, R-Calif. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou3mUSQuvrY   a campaign ad Wednesday, September 26, 2018 2018-09-26    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01346"}
