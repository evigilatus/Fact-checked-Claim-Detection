It was part of a package of tax cuts that included a phased elimination of the estate tax by 2016 and elimination of the gift tax.\n\nIn a newsletter wrapping up the 107th General Assembly emailed on Friday, May 18, state Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey said, \"We gave every Tennessean tax relief by again reducing the food tax \u2013 reductions previous Democrat regimes refused to make.\"\n\nBy referring to \"Democrat regimes,\" Ramsey was making a partisan statement that Republicans cut the sales tax on food and that Democrats had refused similar reductions in the past. But Ramsey \u2013 or his newsletter writer -- apparently has a short memory: the last reduction in Tennessee\u2019s sales tax on grocery food was made in 2007 after it was proposed by legislative Democrats, who were still in the majority at the time, and signed into law by then-governor Phil Bredesen, a Democrat.\n\nThat cut in the state food tax from 6 to 5\u00bd percent went into effect Jan. 1, 2008, when Ramsey was already speaker of the Senate. And it was double the food tax cut that Ramsey is now touting.\n\nSo, on its face, the claim flies in the face of basic facts, and a request for clarification to Ramsey\u2019s office went unanswered.\n\nBut how about the credit Ramsey is taking?\n\nOnly last December, a cut on the sales tax on food was not on Ramsey\u2019s wish list for the 2012 legislative session, and not only did he question the value of a cut on the sales tax on food, he also revealed that he had not been a proponent of the 2007 cut.\n\nRamsey hosted a press conference in his office on Dec. 15 to give reporters a preview of the upcoming legislative session. One question involved whether to cut the state sales tax on food, since Tennessee is one of only 11 states that still tax grocery food. He responded that since Tennessee has no income tax -- which he steadfastly opposes -- \"you have to have a reliable source of income to provide the basic services \u2026 . And so the sales tax on food is that reliable source.\"\n\nAs for that 2007 cut, Ramsey said, \"I\u2019ll bet you that if you poll the citizenry, there isn\u2019t 5 percent that can tell you that when you walk into a grocery store and you buy some pork and beans, your tax is 5.5 percent from the state and if you reach right beside it and get a box of toilet paper, it\u2019s 7 percent. So I think it\u2019s more psychological than it is anything else. We\u2019re never going to do away with it completely so I don\u2019t think that lowering it really does help that much and I think we could concentrate more on the taxes that we can actually eliminate.\"\n\nA reporter asked: \"But weren\u2019t you a big proponent of cutting it back a few years ago?\"\n\nRamsey replied: \"Actually I wasn\u2019t a big proponent to be perfectly honest. At that time, I tried to convince my caucus that the estate tax was the way to go. And we had a good discussion within our caucus on where we needed to go and I lost. And so I was always one at that time who thought we could take that same amount of money -- $45 million I think it was at that time \u2013 and use it for the estate tax as opposed to the sales tax on food and maybe I just didn\u2019t fight hard enough at that time. So no, I was not a proponent at that time.\"\n\nGoing back further in time, to 2002, it was legislative Democrats who successfully argued for exempting grocery food from the one-cent sales tax increase that the state legislature approved that year to end a 3\u00bd-year battle over state tax reform. Up until that time, the state taxed all food at precisely the same rate as it taxed other goods subject to the sales tax.\n\u00a0\nFinally, last month when the budget was about to pass the legislature, House Democrats proposed to use increased revenue that is now flowing into the state to double the food tax cut that Haslam had proposed, cutting it to 5 percent rather than 5-\u00bc percent. But Republicans, including Ramsey, opposed the deeper food tax cut.\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\nA release from Ron Ramsey claimed credit for getting the sales tax on food reduced by a quarter-cent and said Democrats in the past had \"refused\" such cuts.\n\nBut it was Democrats who were primarily responsible for keeping the sales tax on food lower than the overall sales tax in the 2002 budget deal, and it was in fact a Democratic legislature and governor who pushed through a half-cent tax cut in 2007. Ramsey also is on the record as not being a proponent of cutting the sales tax on food.\n\nRamsey may or may not be right about how closely Tennesseeans follow the taxes on their pork and beans and toilet paper, but he\u2019s wildly misleading on the history of who has favored cutting the state sales tax on food and who has not. We rate this claim Pants On Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11026"}
