(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIt is true that the Rothschilds are quite wealthy \u2013 they have been since the 1700s \u2013 but to suggest they are in possession of 80 percent of the world\u2019s wealth is a gross exaggeration.\nWho are the Rothschilds?\nThe Rothschilds are a famous, wealthy Jewish banking family from Europe. The family has long been the target of conspiracy theories, and their wealth is largely thought to be responsible for inspiring the anti-Semitic belief that Jews \"control\" the world\u2019s money. (They\u2019ve been wrongly blamed for everything from starting wars to sinking the Titanic to assassinating U.S. presidents..\nThe family business began in the 1700s in Frankfurt when Mayer Amschel Rothschild became an apprentice at a small bank in Hamburg before returning home to start trading in rare coins. Soon, he began providing financial services for power brokers and, eventually, nobles.\nMayer then dispatched each of his five sons to a different European city \u2013 London, Paris, Vienna, Naples and Frankfurt \u2013 to set up shop.\nThe family\u2019s dealings with various governments and savvy investments paid off handsomely, helping them establish a financial dynasty.\nSo how much money does the family actually have now?\nWhile the Rothschilds certainly still have deep pockets, they have produced hundreds of descendants and there is no longer any centralized family wealth, nor does the family have the same kind of global power it did in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nWith no monolithic house, the Rothschild name has connections to a number of independent business ventures and have investments in mining, energy, farming, real estate and winemaking.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Financial Times once put it, \"The family empire is divided among a web of descendants and a few external shareholders. The ownership structure is opaque, which makes it hard to estimate the family wealth, although it is one of the richest in the world.\"\nThe closest thing to a \"Rothschild\u2019s family\" business today is the Rothschild Group, a multinational investment banking company. But the enterprise does not produce nearly enough money to back up the claim that the family controls 80 percent of the world\u2019s money supply.\nThe Rothschild Group's annual revenue was approximately $500 million in 2017 \u2013 less than what many corporations make. (Walmart, for example, boasted an annual revenue of about $500 billion in 2018.) In April 2017, the Rothschild\u2019s net worth was estimated by Celebrity Net Worth to be around $400 billion.\nAggregate global wealth, for comparison, reached $317 trillion in 2018, according to Credit Suisse Research Institute. That figure comes from an analysis of wealth held by 5 billion adults across the globe, from the least affluent to the wealthiest individuals to arrive at a figure that represents the world\u2019s total household wealth.\nIn 2012, Skeptoid, an award-winning weekly science podcast hosted by writer and producer Brian Andrew Dunning, explored the famous family\u2019s history and noted that while the Rothschild\u2019s are still a looming figure in the banking world, they are still dwarfed by larger, wealthier institutions.\n\"Make no mistake, it's a large and successful company; but with billions in assets, it's a relatively small fish in the sea of world financial institutions with trillions in assets,\" Dunning said then, \"including Deutsche Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, HSBC Holdings, BNP Paribas, Japan Post Bank, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, Barclays PLC, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, Royal Bank of Scotland Group, JP Morgan Chase & Co., and many others. Anyone trying to point the finger at the scattered Rothschilds as \u2018controlling\u2019 world banks has an awfully tall order. That little factoid is about 100 years out of date.\"\nWhile many Rothschild family members hold massive fortunes, it should also be noted only one made it on Forbes world billionaires list: Swiss banker Benjamin de Rothschild, who comes in at No. 1284 with a net worth of $1.6 billion.\nOur ruling\nA meme recirculating the internet claims the Rothschild family \"holds about 80 percent of the world\u2019s wealth,\" and thus has the ability to \"feed, clothe and settle every man, woman and child\" if they so choose.\nThe family is certainly wealthy but claiming they control 80 percent of the world\u2019s wealth is a tall order. There is no longer any centralized family wealth, with the closest being an investment banking firm. But the firm\u2019s revenues are far less than what many corporations make.\nThe rumor is a baseless exaggeration that furthers the spread of anti-Semitic theories.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-01-10 14:07:03 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says \"the Rothschild family holds about 80 percent of the world\u2019s total wealth\" and has the ability to \"literally feed, clothe and settle every man, woman and child on the planet if they wanted to.\"    Viral Image Bloggers    In a meme Saturday, January 5, 2019 2019-01-05    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01143"}
