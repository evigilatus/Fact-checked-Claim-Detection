He is running for president.\n\nCain said it twice during his Saturday rally at Centennial Olympic Park announcing his run. Videos on the large television screen repeated it. And the celebration had all the fixin\u2019s of a presidential bid.\n\nThere were American flags. Red, white and blue balloons sailed into the air. A video of Cain, wearing a cowboy hat and striding past a farm, recounted his humble upbringing.\n\nThere was also a requisite reference to the words of our Founding Fathers:\n\n\"We don\u2019t need to rewrite the Constitution of the United States,\" Cain said. \"We need to reread the Constitution and enforce the Constitution.\"\n\n\"And I know that there\u2019s some people that are not going to do that. So, for the benefit for those that are not going to read it because they don\u2019t want us to go by the Constitution, there\u2019s a little section in there that talks about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n\"You know, those ideals that we live by, we believe in, your parents believe in, they instilled in you. When you get to the part about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, don\u2019t stop right there, keep reading.\n\n\"\u2019Cause that\u2019s when it says that when any form of government becomes destructive of those ideals, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it. We\u2019ve got some altering and some abolishing to do.\"\n\nCain\u2019s exhortation sent your PolitiFact Georgia team scrambling for a closer look at the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe bit about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness wasn\u2019t there. We did a computer search of its text to make sure. Nada.\n\nConstitutional history scholar and University of Pennsylvania professor Richard R. Beeman came to our assistance via email. That phrase is in the second paragraph of the preamble of the Declaration of Independence, which was written in 1776, 11 years before the Constitution was drafted during the Constitutional Convention of 1787.\n\nBeeman agreed with Cain that we don\u2019t need to rewrite the Constitution and it\u2019s more important that Americans read it. \u00a0\n\n\"It might be a good thing if Mr. Cain would undertake that task,\" Beeman said. \u00a0\n\nThat language about abolishing government? It\u2019s in the third paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution, Beeman added.\n\nOops.\n\nWe asked Cain\u2019s campaign to respond. A spokeswoman said he sometimes mentions the Constitution and Declaration of Independence at the same time.\n\n\"Quite often, he references them together when speaking of his appreciation for the work of our Founders,\" she said.\n\nThe language of the two documents can be easy for your average Joe to confuse.\n\nBut confusing the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence is no small mistake, especially for a candidate for president, said Donald E. Wilkes Jr., a University of Georgia law professor. \u00a0\n\nThe Declaration is a statement of beliefs. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land.\n\n\"No court makes a legal decision based on the Declaration of Independence,\" Wilkes said.\n\nWith his first speech as a bona fide candidate, Cain joins a long, bipartisan line of presidential hopefuls who have succumbed to foot-in-mouth disease.\n\nThey include Cain\u2019s foe, President Barack Obama, who accidentally said there were 57 states during the 2008 campaign and U.S. Sen. John McCain, who said in an interview he was unsure how many houses he owned. \u00a0\n\nWelcome to the 2012 presidential election season, folks.\n\nCain earns a False.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 27, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13044"}
