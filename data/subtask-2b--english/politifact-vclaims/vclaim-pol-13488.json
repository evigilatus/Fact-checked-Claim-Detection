According to a transcript of his remarks, Obama thanked the soldiers and talked about his upcoming address to the nation on Iraq and Afghanistan; he made no mention of the border situation or Mexico during his two-hour visit.\nGov. Rick Perry told an interviewer Wednesday that he\u2019d dearly love to be part of Thursday\u2019s White House meeting between President Barack Obama and Mexico President Felipe Calderon. Perry then told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News: \"You know, neither one of them have been on the border to see what's happening to the citizens of Mexico, and for that matter the citizens of Texas.\"\nFor real?\nWe asked Perry\u2019s office for back-up information, simultaneously trying to reach Calderon\u2019s press contact and the White House on whether and why each president has ventured to the border.\nAn online search yielded news articles showing that both Calderon, sworn in as president in 2006, and Obama, president since early 2009, have been to the U.S.-Mexico border, though it appears Obama has traveled there just once, while he was seeking the Democratic nomination for president. As president, he went to Mexico City in 2009.\nAt least three times in 2010, Calderon visited Ciudad Juarez, the city adjoining El Paso, in the wake of January 2010 slayings that drew international attention. The Mexican city had experienced more than 2,500 killings in 2009, according to a CNN dispatch, which also quoted Calderon saying there: \"I come mostly to listen... we're looking for solutions from Juarez because you are the ones living it.\"\nAlso in 2010, Calderon visited Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, and Piedras Negras, opposite Eagle Pass, in the wake of a hurricane. He also helped open an international bridge in Reynosa, near McAllen, at a cross-border event where Obama\u2019s emissary was U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, the former Dallas mayor.\nAnd Obama? In February 2008, according to a CBS News report, then-candidate Obama courted Brownsville voters. The report says he and state Rep. Eddie Lucio III briefly stood near the U.S. bank of the Rio Grande, looking across the border. According to the report, Obama joked: \"This is the first time that I've been this close here, in Texas. I've been in Mexico when I was in college and was going to school in Southern California. I can't entirely talk about it.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama went to Mexico City in April 2009 as part of a swing through Latin America. An April 16, 2009 news article in the New York Times says Obama was the first American president since Bill Clinton to visit Mexico\u2019s capital, where he hoped to shore up Calderon\u2019s \"efforts to combat the rising tide of cross-border drug violence.\"\nThis February, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano invited Republican and Democratic U.S. House leaders to join her at the Mexican border this spring, according to a Feb. 10 Politico news article.\nRepublicans have urged Obama to visit the border.\nIn March 2010, Texas U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn sent Obama a letter including an invitation to join them on a visit to the border region. \"Such a visit would draw national attention to a national priority,\" the letter says, \"and allow you to thank the federal and local officials who are doing heroic work to protect our communities.\"\nIn September 2010, U.S. Sen. John McCain told a Fox News interviewer that he wanted Obama to visit the border. \"I\u2019d love for the president to come and visit the border. Unfortunately, he hasn\u2019t had time to do so,\" the Wall Street Journal quoted McCain saying.\nNext, we asked CBS News\u2019 White House correspondent Mark Knoller to check his well-respected log of presidential trips. Knoller said by e-mail that as president, Obama has not made any U.S.-Mexico border stops. He said Obama\u2019s predecessor, George W. Bush, delivered a speech on border security in El Paso in March 2002, also watching a demonstration of technology that detects contraband in border-crossing vehicles. Knoller said Bush also came to Tucson and El Paso in November 2005 and in May 2006 made a trip to Yuma to observe National Guard troops on the border.\nFinally, we asked political scientist David Shirk, director of the non-partisan Trans-Border Institute at San Diego University, how he\u2019d appraise Perry\u2019s claim. Shirk said Perry\u2019s wrong about Calderon, but correct per Obama who, Shirk said, \"has not visited the border region since the start of his presidency to examine the circumstances that we\u2019re facing here in communities like San Diego and El Paso, places where we are very close to the violence and there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about the possible spillover effects.\"\nAs for whether Obama is \"right for not visiting the border,\" that\u2019s a separate question, Shirk said, adding that the answer depends on whether the \"situation and the (status) of border residents today (is) more important\" than other issues on the nation\u2019s agenda.\n\nTo our inquiry about Obama\u2019s border travels, White House spokesman Adam Abrams declined comment. We didn\u2019t hear back from Perry and failed to connect with Calderon\u2019s office.\n\nPerry\u2019s statement appears to be accurate per Obama, but it\u2019s unmoored regarding Calderon.
