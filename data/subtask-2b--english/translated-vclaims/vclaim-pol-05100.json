The Republicans, Clinton, said, \"He still wants privatization (social security). In fact, their whole idea is to convert the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street.\" However, this is exaggerated. In a long tradition of politicians, including many Democrats, warnings about the Republican social security schemes. As we have noted more than two years ago, the Republicans have for a long time - to no avail - pushed an element of private investment into social security. Advocates usually call these \"personal accounts,\" while critics call them \"privatization.\" Whatever term you use, none of the remaining three presidential candidates said that the United States should hand over the Social Security Fund to Wall Street. A preliminary guide on privatization of social security benefits for today's beneficiaries comes from the income from salary taxes paid by younger and middle-aged workers. Over the years, however, some conservatives have been pushed to convert social security into a system where workers invest at least part of their money to provide retirement. The positive aspect, as the proponents say, is that the nest eggs can be much higher, given that historical rates of return from private investment are higher than social security rates. The downside is the possibility of market losses. Although social security funds are more likely to be invested conservatively than many private investments, doing so will continue to run the risk that beneficiaries will lose their value or, at worst, their savings will be wiped out altogether. Neither can be achieved under the current social security programme. The most prominent suggestion was in 2005, when President George W. Bush drew up a plan to allow workers under the age of 55 to invest part of social security taxes in \"personal retirement accounts.\" Although the Republicans were in control of Congress at the time, the idea did not gather much enthusiasm, and died without even being presented as legislation. A few years later, President Paul Ryan, R-Wiss -- who in 2012 will become the candidate for the post of President of the General Democratic Party, Met Romney, and now acts as speaker in the House of Representatives -- made a similar proposal, allowing workers under the age of 55 to start investing part of social security taxes in a series of government-run funds. Nor did this idea go anywhere in Congress. These failures reinforced the old traditional wisdom that changing the way social security operates is the \"third track\" of politics (i.e., touch it and die). This opposition to change is particularly strong among older voters, who rely on social security and tend to vote at higher than average rates. For this reason, declarations of attack targeting social security have prevailed over the years, often broadcast by Democrats, although at times Republicans. Attacks on plans such as Bush and Ryan have often played the term \"privatization\" as a frightening concept -- so much so that supporters of this kind of proposal have made a great effort to separate their plans from those terms. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, what Republican candidates say when we contacted the Clinton campaign, they sent three examples, one for each of the remaining hopes of the World Democratic Party. For Sin Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the Clinton campaign referred to a remark made by Cruz in the Fourth Republican main debate in November 11, 2015. Cruz said, \"What I said is for older people, we shouldn't make any change at all. For younger workers, we should gradually raise the retirement age. We must have benefits that grow more slowly, and we must allow them to keep part of their taxes in a personal account that they control, and they can transfer them to their children.\" This makes it quite clear that Cruz presents an idea that is very similar to the 2005 Bush proposal. It involves part of the tax, and it not only hands over money to Wall Street, but also makes individuals make their own decisions about how to invest it. Several other statements by Cruz reflect this general approach. This is significantly different from what Clinton's charge said -- that Cruz \"will hand over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street.\" For Goof Ohio. John Kasesh, Clinton's campaign referred to a statement in Chicago Tribune - 16 years ago. According to the article, Kasi\u0107, who was a member of the United States House of Representatives, \"has submitted a similar plan to\" the social security plan that Bush, then a candidate, was calling for. The order included the placing of \"perhaps two percentage points of their social security salary taxes in personal pension accounts to invest in shares and bonds,\" according to the article. However, this was not consistent with what Clinton was accused of in the debate, and today Kasi\u0107 does not even mention personal accounts as part of his proposal to address social security. According to his campaign website, \"John Kasesh's balanced budget framework does not include changes in social security or its benefits to achieve balance, nor does it include the costs of meeting the social security deficit. As President, he will lead a bilateral effort to gather the best ideas from the various reform plans that have been proposed to maintain his own melancholy.\" Clinton's campaign also reached 16 years of age to find evidence of the other candidate, GOP, Donald Trump. He referred to his 2000 book \"America We Worth,\" in which Trump suggested that \"each American should be allowed to allocate a portion of his salary taxes to a personal social security account in which they could own and invest in shares and bonds. Federal guidelines can make sure that your money is diversified, that it invests in sound cooperative funds or securities, not in Imo farms.\" Here again, the Trump plan from 2000 was more precise than the Clinton commentary might suggest -- and more importantly, Trump seems to have said nothing about returning to the idea of a personal account. It does not mention social security as one of the policy issues it addresses on its website, nor does the Trump collection of American Association of Retired Persons (ARP) social security quotations provide any indication that it now favours privatization. Finally, it should be noted that partial privatization schemes were usually limited to younger workers - not those who had reached or approached retirement age. Our referee, Clinton, said that the Republicans \"still want privatization\" (social security). In fact, their whole idea is to convert the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street.\" At least one candidate, Cruz, suggested some form of privatization involving personal accounts financed with a small portion of salary taxes. However, Clinton &apos; s statement takes a long-term democratic exaggeration on the scope of comprehensive reform proposals, and makes it far from the base by suggesting that tax revenues on salaries will flow directly to Wall Street without any input from the beneficiaries. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7db6b4c-d8e0-4bd4-a973-841d3997f405", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05100"}
