Gerry Connolly claims stock market doubles since Obama took oath", "text": "U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, as a leader in President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election \"Truth Team,\" wants to right verbal wrongs on the president\u2019s record.\n\nIn a Feb. 13 interview with on Richmond\u2019s WWBT-TV with NBC12\u2019s Ryan Nobles, Connolly, D-11th, claimed a series of successes for the president\u2019s economic policies. One, in particular, caught our ear.\n\n\"We\u2019ve doubled the stock market from where we started when he was sworn into office -- Bush had gotten it down to 6,500. It\u2019s double that today,\" Connolly said.\n\nWe went to the ticker tapes to see if the stock market really has doubled since Obama\u2019s inauguration on Jan 20, 2009. We were in deep recession then. The stock market took hits as the subprime mortgage crisis exploded. Catastrophic losses at Bear Stearns led to its sale to JPMorgan Chase in March 2008. Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that September.\n\nWe looked first at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, since that\u2019s the index Connolly alluded to in his statement. \u00a0The Dow is an average of 30 large stocks in corporations such as Exxon Mobil, General Motors, Microsoft and Wal-Mart.\n\nThe Dow opened at 8,279.63 on the morning Obama took the oath of office and closed at 12,874.04 on Feb. 13, 2012, when Connolly made his statement. That\u2019s a 55.5 percent increase, not really close to the 100 percent increase Connolly claimed.\n\nSo how does Connolly justify his statement?\n\nThe Dow continued to plummet after Obama took office, hitting a low of 6,469.95 on March 6, 2009. It\u2019s at this point that the Connolly camp begins measuring the stock market\u2019s performance under Obama. The Dow increased 99 percent from that day through the day the congressman made his claim.\n\nJames Walkinshaw, Connolly\u2019s chief of staff, said the market, until that low point, was reacting to the policies of former President George W. Bush, a Republican. He said Obama\u2019s economic plan began to take effect with the passage of the $787 billion stimulus on Feb. 13, 2009 and was not fully in force until the recovery money began flowing out that spring.\n\nWalkinshaw, in an email, also said the Nasdaq Composite Index -- which largely measures stocks of technology companies -- has doubled since Obama became president. Nasdaq opened at 1,520.76 on Inauguration Day and closed at 2,931.39 on the day Connolly made his claim. That\u2019s a 92.8 percent increase -- almost a doubling.\n\nHow much credit does Obama deserve for improvements in the stock market?\n\nSome, but not all, said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University. \u00a0\n\n\"There are many underlying currents in the economy and the federal government can effect their direction and flow,\" he said. \"But the president is just one part of government. There\u2019s Congress, regulatory agencies and the courts and they all fill this amalgam.\"\n\nWhite was skeptical about Connolly\u2019s assertion that the decline of the market was due to Bush and the rise because of Obama. He said policies by both presidents helped lift the recession: Bush pushed through the Troubled Asset Relief Program in October 2008 that eased credit by allowing the U.S. Treasury to buy up to $700 billion in mortgage backed securities from financial institutions; Obama proposed the stimulus, which helped save and create jobs.\n\n\"There was a set of actions started by Bush and continued by Obama that were, in my general opinion, the right actions,\" White said.\n\nMichael Jones, chief investment officer with Riverfront Investment Group of Richmond, linked the upswing to actions by the Federal Reserve System and not presidential policies.\n\nWhite said the two indexes Connolly\u2019s office used -- the blue-chip Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq -- are not the best measures of overall stock market performance. He suggested we look at two gauges that track a broader array of companies.\n\nSo we turned to Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, which measures 500 stocks representing a wide swath of the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 opened at 849.64 on Inauguration Day. It closed at 1,351.77 on the day of Connolly\u2019s statement. That\u2019s a 59.1 percent increase.\n\nWe also looked at the Wilshire 5000, which measures more than 6,500 stocks of all types. The index averaged 8,603.17 during the week on Inauguration Day and closed at 14,290.97 on the day of Connolly\u2019s statement. That\u2019s a 66.1 percent increase.\n\nWe should note that both these indexes have doubled since early March 2009, when the stock market bottomed out.\n\nOne last note: As of March 8, the stock market had not changed much since Feb. 13, when Connolly made his statement. None of the closing figures we give for that date has varied by more than 1 percent.\n\nOur ruling\n\nConnolly said the stock market has doubled since Obama \"was sworn into office.\"\n\nConnolly based his statement on the Dow. But to make his math work, the congressman omitted a 28 percent drop in the Dow that occurred during the first seven weeks of Obama\u2019s presidency, attributing that to the Bush administration. Connolly advantageously begins counting for Obama when the Dow, in early March 2009, sank to its lowest level in almost 12 years.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t quibble if the congressmen had said the market has doubled during Obama\u2019s term -- every index we examined shows it has done just that since March 2009. But Connolly\u2019s statement demands a count from Day 1 of Obama\u2019s administration and when start there,\na different picture emerges.\n\nThe Dow rose 55.5 percent from Inauguration Day to the day of Connolly\u2019s statement. Two broad indexes tell a similar story: the S&P 500 went up 59.1 percent and the Wilshire 5000 increased by 66.1 percent. It\u2019s debatable how much of the improvement can be pinpointed to the president\u2019s policies.\n\nSo Connolly\u2019s claim has a foundation that is cracked by the weight of exaggeration and cherry-picked data. We rate it Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11469"}
