A fired former employee of Adelson\u2019s filed a lawsuit which alleges that Adelson personally approved of prostitution at properties his company owns in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that now is part of China.\n\nAdelson vigorously denies those allegations.\n\nWhat does any of that have to do with Rep. Jim Renacci?\n\nEven though Federal Election Commission records show that Adelson hasn\u2019t ever donated to Renacci, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tried to use the casino owner\u2019s legal woes against the Medina County congressman with a provocatively titled press release: \"Congressman Renacci\u2019s Re-election Funded by Chinese Prostitution Money?\"\n\n\"Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci\u2019s Republican majority,\" the DCCC claimed in a news release on July 2, 2012.\n\n\"What will Congressman Jim Renacci do when his Chinese prostitution money comes from billionaire Sheldon Adelson?\" it continued, urging Renacci to \"reject the support of these groups funded by money from a Chinese prostitution strategy.\"\n\nAs a result of redistricting, Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, Ohio, is pitted against Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat. That makes him a target for the DCCC.\n\nThe DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn\u2019t spent anything so far.\n\nAdelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle. The NRCC regularly sends out news releases that attack Sutton, Renacci\u2019s November election rival who is from Copley Township near Akron.\n\nWhen we asked Renacci campaign spokesman James Slepian about the DCCC\u2019s claim that the congressman\u2019s re-election might somehow be funded by Chinese prostitution money, Slepian replied that there is \"no money from Chinese prostitutes, the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy in our campaign coffers.\"\n\n\"The DCCC's Chinese prostitution fantasy demonstrates that they are now fully immersed in the gutter and will literally say anything to avoid talking about Betty Sutton's lockstep support for the failed Obama economic agenda,\" Slepian said. \"This campaign needs to be about the economy and voting records, not fairy tales about Chinese hookers.\"\n\nThe allegations that Adelson signed off on prostitution at his properties in Macau were raised last month during a lawsuit filed by former Sands executive Steven Jacobs, who was fired from overseeing those properties in July 2010. Associated Press reported that Jacobs\u2019 lawsuit accuses Adelson of breach of contract and pushing him into illegal activity.\n\nA court filing from Jacobs says he tried to rid the casino floor of \"loan sharks and prostitution\" while he worked there, which upset senior executives who informed him that \"the prior prostitution strategy had been personally approved by Adelson.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Adelson\u2019s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always \"maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson\u2019s character.\"\n\nIn a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine, \u00a0Adelson said there\u2019s not a \"shred of evidence\" to back his former employee\u2019s charges, and \"says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) have given millions of dollars to set up clinics around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the \u2026 claims even more preposterous.\" \u00a0Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau.\n\nDo unproven charges by a disgruntled former Adelson employee coupled with Adelson\u2019s generosity to GOP groups that are likely to back Renacci justify the DCCC\u2019s claim that \"foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci\u2019s Republican majority?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t think so.\n\nThe root of the allegation stems from a fired employee\u2019s claim that Adelson allowed prostitution to be present in a casino in Macau. Based on that, the DCCC claims that Adelson, one of the wealthiest people in America, made political contributions with cash from prostitution revenues. And then the claim invokes Renacci\u2019s name as part of the Republican majority that this tainted money is supposedly supporting.\n\nRenacci hasn\u2019t accepted money from Adelson and doesn\u2019t control contributions to the GOP groups that support him.\n\nThe claim that Adelson\u2019s donations to these other groups amount to \"Chinese prostitution money\" is dubious enough that inserting the word \"allegedly\" can\u2019t save it.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the DCCC statement rates Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10780"}
