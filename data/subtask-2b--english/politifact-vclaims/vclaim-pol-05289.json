There's drugs pouring over,\" DeWit said. \"Now we have ISIS coming over the border. You have problems. There's only one candidate that's going to do anything to fix it, and that's Donald Trump.\"\nHe isn\u2019t the first Arizona official to tie ISIS to the U.S-Mexico border. But there\u2019s no evidence to support the claim.\nPolitiFact researched similar statements before:\n\n\nArizona Congressman Trent Franks claimed that ISIS was present in Mexico back in September 2014. That claim was unfounded -- not a single law enforcement official could confirm it. We rated it Mostly False.\n\n\nCiting a report from right-leaning Judicial Watch, California Rep. Duncan Hunter said that U.S. Border Patrol agents caught at least 10 ISIS fighters on the border in Texas back in October 2014. U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron rebuked the claim, noting that individuals with ties to ISIS apprehended at the border is \"categorically false.\" We rated Hunter\u2019s statement Pants on Fire.\n\n\nWe decided to delve into DeWit\u2019s ISIS claim. Is this terrorist group crossing the border?\nOfficials say it\u2019s not happening\nDeWit spokesman Sean Dollman provided us with links to several news stories, including the Judicial Watch report cited by Hunter.\nDollman said it is well-documented enough \"to be mentioned by the Treasurer as a valid concern.\" But he could not provide us with actual evidence that ISIS is crossing the border.\nMultiple officials disputed DeWit\u2019s claim. While a small number of people from Middle Eastern countries have been detained near the border, none have been tied to ISIS (also called Islamic State or ISIL).\nArizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Damon Cecil could not confirm the presence of ISIS at the border.\n\"We do know that people from Middle Eastern countries have crossed the U.S./Mexican border in Arizona. We are not able to confirm that anyone caught trying to illegally enter the U.S. from Mexico has ties to ISIS or any other terrorist organization,\" Cecil said.\nThe influx of immigrants from the Middle East using the U.S.-Mexico border, however, goes back several years.\nA report released in 2006 from the House Committee on Homeland Security states that \"each year, hundreds of illegal aliens from countries known to harbor terrorists or promote terrorism\" are routinely encountered when they attempt to cross the border.\nThe report also notes that several items have been found at the Rio Grande River, which runs from Colorado through Mexico, including a \"jacket with patches from countries where al-Qaida is known to operate.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, the report definitively states that members of terrorist group Hezbollah \"have already entered the United States\" using the border sometime before 2005.\nAn August 2009 Government Accountability Office report also notes that Border Patrol encountered three people with \"links to terrorism\" at southwest border checkpoints in fiscal year 2008.\nThe House Committee on Homeland Security released an updated report in 2012. According to this report, from fiscal years 2006 to 2011, 1,918 \"special interest\" aliens, or aliens with ties to countries that \"could bring harm\" via terrorism, were apprehended at the border.\nBut, as far as ISIS, the connection isn\u2019t there.\nRecently, Border Patrol agents detained five Pakistani immigrants and one Afghan immigrant near the Arizona border in November 2015. However, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that records checks on the immigrants \"revealed no derogatory information.\" \u00a0\nEight Syrians were also stopped at the Texas border in November, but DHS said they were regular migrants.\nColin Clarke, an international security expert at the Rand Corporation, said he hasn\u2019t seen any evidence of ISIS coming in over the border, but it\u2019s possible.\n\"The border is vulnerable, why wouldn\u2019t they try that?\" Clarke said. \"It\u2019s certainly feasible that these guys could, through multiple attempts, smuggle someone across.\"\nTim Nichols, an intelligence expert and associate professor at Duke University, said he is not aware of any information supporting DeWit\u2019s statement. And neither are the feds.\n\"The\u00a0suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,\" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson.\nWe also reached out to Mexico\u2019s embassy in Washington D.C. Their spokesman, Ariel Moutsatsos-Morales, refuted DeWit\u2019s claim.\n\"The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies any statement on the alleged presence of ISIS's operating cells throughout the border region. Mexican authorities have no record of the presence of Islamist extremist groups or individuals in Mexico. Officials from Mexico and the United States maintain permanent contact with each other and continuously exchange information on security threats,\" Morales said.\nA June 2015 State Department terrorism report makes this clear too:\n\"There were no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, despite several erroneous press reports to the contrary during 2014. There was no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory.\"\nOur ruling\nDeWit said, \"now we have ISIS coming over the border.\" There is no definitive evidence of that.\nYes, people with ties to the Middle East have been encountered at the border. Members of terrorist group Hezbollah entered the United States via the border sometime before 2005. But there\u2019s no evidence that terrorists linked to ISIS have crossed the border, and many public safety officials have said flatly that it hasn\u2019t happened.\nFor that, we rate DeWit\u2019s claim as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05289"}
