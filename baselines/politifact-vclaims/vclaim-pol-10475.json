In Massachusetts, Gov. Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races, raised testing standards, and put into place a merit scholarship ... He's a champion for bringing hope to education,\" Bush said in the Aug. 30 speech.\n\nWe have examined the claim about Massachusetts\u2019 achievement gap in July, when Romney himself said it. Here\u2019s another look.\n\nA little on Massachusetts schools\n\nIn 1993, lawmakers in Massachusetts passed a landmark reform law that included the groundwork for the state accountability system (later called Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS), authorized charter schools and invested more money in local school districts. Its universal goal was to raise educational standards for all Massachusetts kids.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that the Bay State is already a leader in student achievement. Massachusetts, which has a disproportionately high number of colleges and universities, some of the nation\u2019s wealthiest ZIP codes and a well-educated workforce, churns out many high-performing students.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the glare of those top achievers makes the shadow of struggling students that much darker. That is to say, Massachusetts still has a significant achievement gap. And because the kids at the top do so well, it\u2019s that much harder for everybody else to catch up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Our scores are high, so as they get higher it\u2019s pretty hard to move up,\" said Kathleen Skinner, a policy director at the Massachusetts Teachers Association, a teachers union.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNarrowing the gap\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen we checked this claim before, the Romney campaign pointed us to a 2007 MCAS test results summary, and specifically cited the 10th grade scores:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10th Grade Proficiency In Math\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2005, White: 29%; Black: 19%. Gap = 10 points\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2007, White: 29%; Black: 26%. Gap = 3 points\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10th Grade Proficiency In English\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2005, White: 46%; Black: 30%. Gap = 16 points\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2007, White: 52%; Black: 40%. Gap = 12 points\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThat shows the achievement gap narrowing by 7 percentage points in math and by 4 percentage points in English.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the gains in other grades are smaller.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmong eighth-graders, the gap tightened by only 1 point in math and 2 points in English. For seventh-graders, the change was 3 points in math, 5 points in English. Sixth grade: 1 point in math, no change in English. In fourth grade scores, the gap narrowed by 1 point in math and widened by 1 point in English. (Some of those are comparisons between 2006 scores and 2007, the only years provided in the test results summary.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSkinner noted an important point about the MCAS: 10th-graders have to pass it in order to graduate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"They start paying attention,\" she said.\n\nWe also took a look at scores for the following year, comparing the achievement gap between 2007 and 2008. (These charts offer a slightly different comparison from the previous year, which looked at students who scored \"proficient\" on each test. The 2007-08 chart includes those scoring proficient and higher.) The best gains again were made by 10th graders who narrowed the gap by six points in English. But there was no change in the gap in math scores, and lower grades showed only one- or two-point gains, or no improvement at all, and the gap widened in a couple of instances, such as eighth-grade science scores. The 2008-2009 test score summary reflected a similar trend: small gains in some subjects and small setbacks in others.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBeverly Miyares, also with the Massachusetts Teachers Association, added that the dropout rate among black students in Massachusetts increased from 2002 to 2004, rising from 4.9 to 6.3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThat means more under-performing students who dropped out of school didn\u2019t drag down the overall average test scores.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRomney\u2019s role\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn claims such as this, we don\u2019t just consider the accuracy but also whether the speaker deserves credit: How responsible was Romney for narrowing the achievement gap?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The most important point to make with Gov. Romney\u2019s record is that the reform he initiated was part of a much larger and longer movement that existed in Massachusetts,\" said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent research about public education reform in Massachusetts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nGlenn Koocher, executive director with the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, which represents school boards, was less generous: \"He had nothing to do with it. It\u2019s the teachers in the classrooms who are making the difference.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSkinner, the expert with the teachers\u2019 union, added that Romney was \"a somewhat absent \u2018education\u2019 governor. He was very agenda driven.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We would argue that he didn\u2019t put anything in place\" to narrow the gap, she said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe also wondered whether Romney had pushed any initiatives specifically aimed at helping minority students. Koocher and Skinner both mentioned charter schools, which are favored by many Republicans.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The charter school program was always popular among minority parents (and) any parents that wanted to get their kids out of the public schools,\" Koocher said, adding that vouchers commonly used to pay tuition at charter schools are unconstitutional in Massachusetts. Instead, the per-pupil state spending is deducted from the public school district\u2019s budget.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRyan Williams, spokesman for the Romney campaign, said protecting the 1993 reform legislation was an important effort by Romney. He said there were attempts to repeal the requirement that 10th graders pass the test in order to graduate, and Romney \"stood firm on that and did not back down.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It was one of the bigger things we had success in blocking,\" Williams said. \"A lot of what Romney did when he was governor was to preserve that legislation. He said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to roll these standards back.\u2019\"\n\nSkinner mentioned another, perhaps less obvious, initiative from Romney that helped many minority students: universal health care. Romney signed a health care reform law in Massachusetts that led to a 98 percent coverage rate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"In Massachusetts, all of our kids have health insurance, and I don\u2019t think anybody should underestimate the impact that has on learning. Our kids get vaccinated, they can go to the dentist, they can go to the eye doctor,\" she said. \"Their health is less of an issue than it is in other places.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBush said, \"in Massachusetts, Gov. Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races.\"\n\nState education figures over two years support Bush\u2019s claim about learning gains when Romney was governor, although it\u2019s worth noting that some areas declined on Romney\u2019s watch, such as the drop-out rate. And it\u2019s always somewhat dubious to take a snapshot of statistics from only one or two years, when, as d'Entremont said, \"significant gains in student achievement don\u2019t happen overnight, and the gains in Massachusetts are the result of a 20-year reform effort.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, Romney, a single-term governor, should not get all the credit for improvement in the achievement gap, which is influenced by myriad factors.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBush\u2019s statement about Romney is partially accurate but omits a lot of important information and overstates the former governor\u2019s impact. We rate it Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
