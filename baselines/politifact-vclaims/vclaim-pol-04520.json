Interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low.\"\nThe line about interior deportations under Obama sliding 40 percent and reaching nine-year lows piqued our interest. The National Border Patrol Council did not respond to our requests for information on the data behind that statement. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign posted on its website the council\u2019s statement, but they did not respond for comments either.\nThe National Border Patrol Council identifies as the official group representing 16,500 border patrol agents. It endorsed Donald Trump for president in March, saying it was the first time ever it endorsed a presidential candidate in the primaries.\nICE immigration removals declining\nThe Department of Homeland Security agencies include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles naturalization and permanent residency applications, among other things.\nICE guided us to the agency\u2019s most recent statistical report on immigration removals.\u00a0\nICE says that in fiscal year 2015 (Oct. 1, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2015) the agency began implementing the Obama administration\u2019s \"clearer and more refined\" civil immigration enforcement priorities, with emphasis on the removal of convicted felons over non-criminals.\nAs a result, there were fewer removals in fiscal 2015 (235,413) than in fiscal 2014 (315,943), ICE said.\nThat\u2019s a single-year decrease of 25.5 percent. \u00a0\n\u2018Down 40 percent and at a nine-year low\u2019\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council\u2019s statement said \"interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low.\"\nICE\u2019s fiscal 2015 immigration removals report distinguishes between interior and border removals.\nInterior removals account for individuals \"identified or apprehended in the United States by an ICE officer or agent.\" These can include apprehensions from jails or elsewhere inside the country, immigration experts say.\nBorder removals, meanwhile, refers to individuals removed by ICE who were \"apprehended by a CBP officer or agent while attempting to illicitly enter the United States at or between the ports of entry.\" ICE says those individuals are also referred to as recent border crossers. These CBP apprehensions at or between ports of entry are then handled by ICE.\nInterior removals declined about 71 percent from 237,941 in fiscal 2009 (the first year Obama entered office), to 69,478 in fiscal 2015, based on ICE data.\u00a0\nAnd interior removals in fiscal 2015 were the lowest over the eight fiscal years noted in the ICE report.\n\n\nWe don\u2019t have data before fiscal year 2008, according to Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank founded by Democratic and Republican senators that has researched the removal data.\nSo it\u2019s difficult to determine if interior deportations are at a 9-year low. But certainly interior deportations have dropped significantly.\nImmigration policy analysts have told us that interior deportations have decreased under Obama due to the administration\u2019s priority on border apprehensions and on removing undocumented immigrants who pose threats to public safety.\nOur ruling\nThe National Border Patrol Council said in a statement that \"interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low.\"\nThe group did not return requests for comment, but we found ICE data that references \"interior\" and \"border\" removals. Using that data, there isn\u2019t a 40 percent drop --\u00a0actually it's about 71 percent.\u00a0Reports say interior or border removal data wasn\u2019t broken down that way before fiscal 2008, so there isn\u2019t a way to measure the 9-year low, though fiscal 2015 interior removals do represent an 8-year low.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/261e76c1-148b-4e98-add3-f49d96b51fc3", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04520"}
