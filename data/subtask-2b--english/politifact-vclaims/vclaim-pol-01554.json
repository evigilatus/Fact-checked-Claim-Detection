Another would enshrine the \"right to hunt and fish\" in the Constitution. Others would cap the state income tax rate at 7 percent and grant victims of crime the right to know specific legal information.\nThen there are the pair of proposed amendments that would reduce the governor\u2019s power by limiting his or her\u00a0authority to fill judicial vacancies\u00a0and shifting the responsibility for appointing elections board members from the governor to the legislature.\nIn the\u00a0commercial, a narrator opens by asking viewers to \"take a closer look at constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall.\"\n\"Every former chief justice and every former governor \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 all recommend voting no,\" the narrator continues.\n\"They say these amendments are purposefully vague, a blank check for politicians who could block corruption investigations and strip all of our courts of independence, permanently. The closer you look at these misleading amendments, the worse they get. Vote no.\"\nEach of the amendments was put on the ballot by the legislature, which is controlled by Republicans. The commercial was paid for by the Stop Deceptive Amendments political committee, which is treasured by Michael Weisel. Weisel is an elections attorney who the Associated Press recently described as\u00a0a prominent figure on the political left.\n\nThe group bought airtime with WRAL-TV in Raleigh and Charlotte\u2019s WSOC-TV, the\u00a0Charlotte Observer\u00a0reported Tuesday.\nGiven that most North Carolinians are likely more familiar with governors than former chief justices, let\u2019s turn our attention there. Is it true that every living former governor \u2014 including Republicans Pat McCrory and Jim Martin \u2014 opposes each of the six amendments?\nPut simply: no.\nRepublican support\nWhile\u00a0all former governors made news recently\u00a0for opposing the amendments that affect the governor\u2019s office, McCrory reaffirmed his support of the voter ID, victims\u2019 rights, tax cap and hunting and fishing amendments during his radio show Monday morning. \"It\u2019s a false and misleading ad,\" McCrory said on\u00a0WBT Radio in Charlotte.\nHe also said he sent a letter to various media stations asking them to stop airing the ad, and threatened legal action if they don\u2019t.\n\"I demand that you immediately take down these advertisements, since they falsely impute to me a position which I have vocally opposed in the media, and further because such falsehoods inflict ongoing damage both to my reputation and to the campaign to pass Marsy\u2019s Law, on which I am a prominent supporter and endorser,\" the letter says.\nMarsy\u2019s Law is another name for the victims\u2019 rights amendment. Chris Sinclair, an advocate for the proposed amendment, emailed PolitiFact a photo of McCrory speaking at a Marsy\u2019s event at Latta Park in Charlotte on Sept. 10.\n\nMartin, for his part, told us in an email that he holds the same view of the amendments that McCrory does.\n\"Personally, I am opposed to the two previously identified amendments that remove appointive authority from the governor and transfer it to the legislature (for all practical purposes, to its leadership),\" Martin\u2019s email says. \"They appear to be the last two of the referendum amendments on all ballots. I am not opposed to the other amendments.\"\nA denial\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeisel, when contacted by PolitiFact, referred us to Stop Deceptive Ads spokesman Justin Guillory. Guillory said Tuesday the ad doesn\u2019t, in fact, suggest that all former governors oppose all of the constitutional amendments.\n\"The ad clearly references two amendments that would give additional appointment powers to the state legislature. Those are the same two amendments that McCrory opposes,\" Guillory wrote in an email.\n\n\"We appreciate Gov. McCrory\u2019s bipartisan leadership in opposing these two amendments and that\u2019s why we chose to feature the five former governors in our ads,\" he continued. \"Part of what is confusing about these constitutional amendments is that the legislature didn\u2019t allow titles or any other identifiers on the ballot. There are no titles for us to reference in an ad.\"\nGuillory has a point: The amendments on the ballot will lack numbers or titles. (Read them on the N.C. Secretary of State\u00a0website.)\nWhat the ad says\nLet\u2019s look again at what the narrator says.\nGuillory says the ad is talking only about the two amendments related to gubernatorial powers. He says the narrator alludes to those two when saying they would \"block corruption investigations and strip all of our courts from independence.\"\nBut the ad makes no clear distinction between the two amendments affecting the governor\u2019s powers, and the four others.\nThe narrator says, \"Take a closer look at constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall.\" There\u2019s no reason viewers would think to look at only two of them, specifically.\nImmediately after that, the narrator says: \"Every former chief justice and every former governor \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 all recommend voting no.\"\nAgain, there\u2019s no distinction.\nA change\nWednesday evening, Guillory sent an email announcing that the group had changed the ad.\nIn the new version, the narrator begins the ad specifying the amendments that affect the governor\u2019s power.\n\"Take a closer look at two constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall,\" the narrator says.\nGuillory says Stop Deceptive Amendments stands by its original version, but that \"defeating these two amendments is more important than a political spat.\n\"We\u2019ve sent a revised version of the ad to TV stations that clarifies which two amendments the five governors oppose,\" Guillory said.\n\"We continue to appreciate Gov. McCrory\u2019s bi-partisan leadership in opposing these two amendments and the courage it takes for him to confront the legislative leaders of his own party. We look forward to working with leaders of both parties to defeat these two dangerous and misleading amendments.\"\nOur ruling\nThe original Stop Deceptive Amendments commercial suggests that every former North Carolina governor opposes all six constitutional amendments. That\u2019s not true. McCrory and Martin (the only two former Republican governors who are still living) oppose the two amendments that affect the governor\u2019s powers, but support the other four amendments. While PolitiFact appreciates the group\u2019s effort to be more accurate, we must set the record straight for those who have already seen the original ad and rate this claim False.\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
