However, regardless of the details, the point Edwards is trying to make is the same: because they lack bank accounts, millions of poor people must rely on expensive cheque-exchange services and day-to-day loans. The Edwards campaign website uses the American Progress Centre, a left-wing think tank for the figure of about 56 million people without accounts. The Centre obtained the figure from a 2002 report of the General Accounting Office, which used census data in the United States to estimate that 55.9 million adults did not keep screening accounts, savings or cash markets in 1999. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for open security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, this figure is at the very end of the available estimates. According to the 2004 Federal Reserve Board survey on consumer financing, most recently, the number of American households without a bank account is close to 10 million. The population is estimated at 2.6 people per house, which would make the Federal Reserve's estimate of bank accounts at the latest 26 million because the number of households in the census includes children.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00327"}
