The measure would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for a limited number of drugs, cap what seniors pay out-of-pocket at $2,000 and force companies that have raised prices beyond inflation since 2016 to either reverse the price or rebate the amount of the increase to the federal government.\nAnd drug manufacturers are in full attack mode.\nTake a recent Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America advertising message embedded in the popular, inside-the-Beltway \"Politico Playbook PM\" newsletter.\n\"Speaker Pelosi's drug pricing plan would siphon $1 trillion or more from biopharmaceutical innovators over the next 10 years,\" read the ad. \"CBO's preliminary estimate found this bill \u2018would result in lower spending on research and development and thus reduce the introduction of new drugs.\u2019\"\nThe trade group\u2019s statement represents a core drug-industry argument, deployed whenever lawmakers propose reining in drug prices: Efforts to limit what drug companies can charge means they won\u2019t have the means or incentive to develop lifesaving medications. The argument also appears in ads like this one \u2015 from America\u2019s Biopharmaceutical Companies \u2015 that highlight patients who say they depend on new medications to keep chronic conditions at bay.\nBut many experts contest the link between drug prices and pharmaceutical R&D. So PhRMA\u2019s citation of the Congressional Budget Office \u2015 an influential nonpartisan government agency \u2015 caught our attention. We decided to look deeper.\nWhat the CBO says\nA PhRMA spokeswoman pointed us to a preliminary CBO analysis of H.R. 3. Published Oct. 11, the letter doesn\u2019t analyze the Pelosi bill but attempts to explain in broad strokes what kind of economic impact it might have.\nThe \"$1 trillion\" over 10 years statistic is the CBO\u2019s upper estimate (the range begins at $500 billion) of what the industry might lose in revenue if this bill were enacted. But the agency leaves wiggle room, noting that this is a \"preliminary\" figure and that the agency hasn\u2019t finished analyzing the full bill yet. Once it does, the $1 trillion could change.\n\"They\u2019re trying to provide some sense of the relative impact on drug development, but I don\u2019t think we have enough data to provide this,\" said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University. \"It\u2019s not a fact. It\u2019s a preliminary estimate that is on very shaky ground.\"\nThat leads to the next issue: If pharmaceutical revenues dip, would fewer innovative drugs become available?\nTechnically, kind of. But there\u2019s a lot of important context that PhRMA\u2019s assertion overlooks.\nThe CBO estimates that, over the next decade, between eight and 15 fewer drugs would come to market.\nBut the big picture matters: Every year, the Food and Drug Administration approves 30 new drugs, on average. That\u2019s 300 new drugs over 10 years. So if you assume 15 fewer drugs out of 300 projected approvals, that\u2019s a loss of 5%.\nCertainly that is, as PhRMA argued, a reduction. But none of the experts we spoke with saw it as a blow to innovation. \"The lower prices envisioned by [Pelosi\u2019s] bill would barely slow new drug discovery at all,\" argued Dr. Peter Bach, who directs the Drug Pricing Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in an op-ed for Bloomberg.\nIt\u2019s not clear from the CBO analysis what kind of clinical value these forgone drugs would have \u2015 whether they would represent meaningful breakthroughs or marginal improvements to medications that already exist.\nWe asked PhRMA. The organization\u2019s position is that the lost revenue could discourage drugmakers from researching new treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, lung cancer and sickle cell disease.\nBut the group didn\u2019t offer much evidence explaining how or why this would happen, or acknowledging that it would involve stepping away from potentially lucrative markets. And experts dispute the idea \u2015 Dusetzina called the industry line \"a scare tactic.\"\nIn fact, she said, \"there is a good reason to believe that the drugs you would lose are those that have the smallest benefit and highest price tag.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gets at another point: A substantial portion of drug research and development isn\u2019t actually done by drugmakers. The riskiest portions often are conducted in government-funded labs, noted Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor at Harvard Medical School who studies pharmaceutical policy. Drug companies get involved much later, making it even less certain that a loss in pharmaceutical revenue would meaningfully discourage breakthrough drug innovation.\nAnd any loss of new drugs would likely be at least somewhat offset by Americans\u2019 increased ability to afford newly cheaper drugs. As the CBO report put it: \"The overall effect on the health of families in the United States that would stem from increased use of prescription drugs but decreased availability of new drugs is unclear.\"\nSo, in short: Nonpartisan analysis suggests that H.R. 3 could result in fewer drugs coming to market. But it\u2019s a very preliminary estimate, and even then, it suggests only a small dip. The value of the drugs that don\u2019t emerge is unclear, too. All this context matters a lot.\n\"Hundreds of billions in savings to taxpayers, businesses and patients would mean a real but very small decline in the rate at which new treatments are discovered,\" Bach wrote.\nOther arguments\nPhRMA also pointed us to a Dec. 3 report put out by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. It found a much higher impact \u2015 arguing that H.R.3 would result in \"as many as 100 fewer drugs\" entering the American market in the next 10 years.\nThis White House report comes after President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to work with Congress to lower drug prices.\nThe CEA number rests on a series of assumptions. First, it estimates that a new drug costs $2 billion to develop. It also assumes that drug companies typically spend at least a fifth of their revenue on research and development. Therefore, if companies\u2019 revenue goes down by $1 trillion, then the math comes out to losing 100 drugs.\nBut experts called this analysis suspect at best.\nFor one thing, Bach told us, the $2 billion figure isn\u2019t substantiated. For another, the CEA assumes that \"every penny of company R&D spending goes to inventing new drugs.\"\nThat, he added, is \"utter nonsense.\"\nMultiple experts noted that the CEA assumes pharmaceutical companies would cut their R&D to perfectly match the proportion of revenue they currently spend.\nThere\u2019s no reason to assume that\u2019s true. Drug companies also spend a good deal on marketing, administration and dividends to shareholders.\nDusetzina also noted that the analysis doesn\u2019t consider the increased revenue drug companies might experience from more people being able to afford drugs and therefore buy them. And it assumes the drugs that never make it to the marketplace would be of high value \u2015 without evidence to support that.\n\"This is not a serious analysis of the question of trade-offs of this policy and innovation. This is fearmongering,\" Dusetzina said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nIn its advertisement, PhRMA cites a CBO analysis of the Pelosi-backed drug-pricing bill, H.R. 3. The ad suggests that the bill would \"siphon $1 trillion or more from biopharmaceutical innovators over the next 10 years\" and \"reduce the introduction of new drugs.\"\nThis claim misses lots of important context. The CBO\u2019s analysis is preliminary, and it could change. The $1 trillion in forgone revenue is the upper limit of what that preliminary analysis predicts.\nAnd even if you assume drug companies would lose this much in revenue, the number of drugs that wouldn't make it to market would constitute a small fraction of what pharmaceutical companies typically produce, said\u00a0experts. It\u2019s further unclear that the forgone drugs would have major clinical value \u2015 little evidence suggests they necessarily would.\nOther analyses PhRMA pointed us to \u2015 which might ostensibly support their claim \u2015 don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny.\nThis statement has some truth to it but omits crucial context that would give a radically different impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16655"}
