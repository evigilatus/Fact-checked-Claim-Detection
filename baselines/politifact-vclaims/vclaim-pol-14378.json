And like any good lyric, the phrase is catchy.\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich is singing it about incumbent governor Ted Strickland, and the Republican Governors Association has made the phrase the central theme of three commercials attacking Strickland on behalf of Kasich.\n\nAnd U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman sings it about his Democratic challenger Lee Fisher, who is Ohio\u2019s lieutenant governor and former head of the state\u2019s economic development department, in a statewide ad titled \"Job Czar.\"\n\n\"Under Lee Fisher Ohio has lost nearly 400,000 jobs,\" is the key line in Portman's ad.\n\nThe phrase has been aired so often, it's approaching the status of an oldie. Whether it's a goodie is the question.\n\nThe Republicans are referring to the state\u2019s net job losses since Strickland and Fisher took office in January 2007. Ohio lost about 390,000 non-farm jobs from January 2007 through July of this year, the latest figure available. So Republicans are largely accurate when they say Ohio has lost 400,000 jobs since January of 2007. Job losses were as high as 438,900 at the end of February of this year.\n\nWhen we reviewed the Republican Governor\u2019s Association rendition that focused on Strickland, we rated it Half True. We said then that the claim hit a clunker when Republicans suggest that the governor was responsible for the job losses.\n\nOhio has been losing jobs since January of 2000 - 568,300 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of those, 403,800 came in the manufacturing sector.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, since campaigns are trying to blame those in charge when the state lost jobs, that Republicans held the offices of governor and lieutenant governor seven of those years and held both houses of the legislatures until January 2009. Republican George W. Bush was president for eight of those years.\n\nStrickland has argued for the administration that Ohio - like Michigan and other Midwest states -- was especially hurt by forces beyond his control, namely a recession and the decline of manufacturing. Ohio and the nation have suffered through two recessions, one that started in 2001 and one that started in 2008, which triggered an avalanche of job losses here and was considered a global economic crisis.\n\nIndiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican elected in 2004 who is in his second term, says the same thing, at least he did July 22 during an interview in Cleveland. What made Daniels\u2019 comments worth highlighting is that the rising GOP star was in town campaigning with Kasich. The two were beating up on Strickland for the state\u2019s job losses.\n\nBut Daniels became a bit defensive when questioned about Hoosier State less than stellar performance in the last several years. Indiana lost 174,000 net jobs since January of 2007.\n\nEchoing the sentiments of other governors in defense of their states\u2019 economic woes, he said, \"To some extent, everybody is at the mercy of national and global events, and we are no different.\"\n\nBut this claim that targets Fisher has a slightly different tune.\n\nThe ad that targeted Strickland phrased the job loss as happening \"on his watch,\" which we think implies he is at fault. This claim phrased the job loss as happening \"under Lee Fisher,\" which we think is more neutral language that conveys the idea that it occurred while he was the director of the agency.\n\nAlso, Fisher\u2019s role here was different than that of Strickland. While Strickland, as governor, may set policy for the administration to follow, Fisher held a hands-on position of control in the Department of Development.\n\nConsider it this way: It might be unfair to blame the high school principal for unruly behavior in a classroom, but reasonable to hold the teacher in charge of that class to a higher standard.\n\nThat the ad focuses on Fisher as the state's development director raises another issue. Fisher stepped down as development director in February 2009. BLS data shows that during his tenure Ohio had a net loss of about 255,000 jobs; a significant number of jobs, although not as many as the Portman ad states.\u00a0The higher jobs figure in the ad reflects net jobs lost into this year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, at a time when Ohio lost thousands of jobs, Fisher was in charge of the state agency most responsible for bringing new jobs to Ohio. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s responsible for the job losses, but he was in charge of the department most capable of addressing the problem.\n\nWe find Portman\u2019s claim in his Job Czar ad to be Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14378"}
