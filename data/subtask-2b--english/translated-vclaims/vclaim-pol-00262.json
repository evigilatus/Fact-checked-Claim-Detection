However, after his visit to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton on 7 August, Internet users began to share a false rumour that a viral image of Trump smiled with a group of nurses had been organized, and that nurses were in fact paid representatives. According to several Facebook articles, members of the media were not allowed to enter during the visit and women arrived at the hospital a few hours before Trump. While journalists were not allowed to enter the hospital during Tramp &apos; s visit, the rest of the prosecution is false. One of the articles shares a Twitter photo from a guy named Fred Galliley, who says: \"I got a letter from a friend who knows a nurse at the hospital who told her that many of the women who were at the hospital wearing a nurse's uniform aren't working at the hospital. They showed up two hours before Trump arrived. That was organized. This is why journalists are not allowed.\" Another article now contains the eloquent picture of nurses smiling and holding Trump: \"The media is not allowed. The nurses stated that women in this picture do not work in their hospital. \"Why is he surrounded by the majority of the women who touch him? This is propaganda bullshit from a Russian agent who's been installed. The various news agencies are looking into this image and the people who have been introduced or pushed into it. The only woman on the far right was in his congregations. There may have been others seen in his gatherings as well. Note that all the badges have turned back.\" On January 11, 2021, some Facebook commentators wrote in an article in Facebook Nancy Belusi that was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, some commentators expressed doubts about the authenticity of the picture by asking why those images appeared in a different colour brush. These articles were referred to, on 8 August, as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misinformation in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We contacted the user of Fred Galili's Twitter account, @faridghalili, about his claim that he had received a letter from a friend about the photo that had been organized. Galile responded to the newspaper Politi Fact in a direct letter, saying that the text he mentioned came from a former hospital employee who knew who lived in Ohio. He said that the person told Galilee that neither his friend nor his friend &apos; s source wanted to talk to journalists. \"I live (like this) a good detective who can verify this and detail (like this), \" said Galilie. \"But so far from what I've heard, hospital staff and nurses don't talk about it.\" Well, we've submitted our own report. The picture is real and women are employed in the hospital. :: Howard, Director of Communications at Miami Valley Hospital, confirmed to Poletti Fuckett that the women in the picture worked at the hospital. \"They're hospital staff. Photos from the visit include our nurses, our employees, our first responders and patients, \"Howard said. \" (f) The color of the suit may vary depending on the unit in which it operates.\" We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00262"}
