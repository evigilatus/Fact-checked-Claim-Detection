The Senate race between Nan and Birdo Republicans is being closely monitored here and at the national level. Nan's victory will allow Democrats to get a state office back. The result can also determine the majority control in the United States Senate, which is now narrowly dominated by Democrats. The two candidates require support from women, who make up about 56% of the nearest 5 million voters in the state. Nan has already tried to make the political straw of the fact that the General dollar was sued against gender discrimination during the term of Birdo as its executive head. (The case was settled in the amount of $18.75 million several years after Birdo left the company, without recognizing any wrongful act.) The new declaration of Georgians together brings a public claim in dollars. He is also charged with the invalidity of conflicting laws providing for \"equal protection of women,\" an allegation that Poletti Fakt Georgia has decided to justify further investigation. The Supreme Council's public demand is a reference to Birdo's opposition to the Pay Equity Act, a bill endorsed by President Barack Obama and most Democrats in the capital Hill and opposed by Republicans in Congress. Proponents say that the bill - a bill, not a law, as both Georgians say - contains practical steps to promote fair pay for women that the Equal Pay Act 1963 has not been able to achieve. They argue that this law would strengthen remedies for victims of gender discrimination and require employers to prove that wage differentials are work-related, not gender-based, not biased, but business necessity. Proponents of the bill say that employers will be prevented from retaliating against workers who enquire about employers &apos; remuneration practices or disclose their wages. Obama has already signed an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from retaliating against employees who choose to discuss compensation, and continues to urge Congress to pass the bill. It is argued by the opposition that legislation misdiagnoses the problem. They question the statements made by their supporters and argue that the passage of the bill could lead to further litigation and even jobs going abroad. This bill was passed by the Council in January 2009 but was discontinued in the Senate. The opposition claims that this year has returned as an electoral tactic by the Democrats who want to paint Republicans as unsympathizing with women in the labour force. Derek Dickie, spokesperson for the Birdo campaign, said that Birdo did not support the bill because he believed that the Equal Pay Act of 1963 made it clear that women and men must be paid equal pay for equal work. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job.\" \"This announcement is just another example of Michelle Nan trying to perpetuate fraud against the people of Georgia on behalf of the (majority) head of Harry Reed and Barack Obama.\" Nan in the records as a supporter of the bill, which Diana Fertgott-Ruth, a former senior economist with the United States Department of Labor in the George W. Bush administration, told us, at this stage, that it appears to be \"just a point of dialogue.\" She said: \"If it didn't go through 2010 (when Democrats were in control), it wouldn't go through now.\" The Director of Economics 21 at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a research centre in New York, said that there were concerns that the bill was \"a truly full work for trial lawyers.\" For example, she cited a provision in the draft law that would allow an employer found guilty of \"so-called discrimination\" to be liable for punitive damages, rather than simply for compensation. Forktgut-Ruth said that three current laws addressed this issue - the Equal Pay Act 1963, the Civil Rights Act and the Lily Ledbetter Fair Wages Act 2009. The Obama-down Democrats have emphasized the \"gender pay gap\" throughout the year. There is always debate about the extent of this gap, although most people quote from the 2011 United States Census Office report, which shows that women &apos; s total wages were approximately 23 per cent lower than men &apos; s. However, this large discrepancy is partly due to the fact that men generally work longer hours. The study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of working hours. Some rigorous economic studies have shown that women earn almost the same as men - 95 cents for men's dollars when jobs, experience and working hours are similar. Our judgment is overwhelmingly opposed by laws that grant women the right to equal pay for equal work. There is no evidence of this. In fact, Birdo says he supports equal pay for equal work. The only thing the Supreme Council can point out is that it is opposed by law to one proposal that advocates say gives women more power to combat discrimination. We're assessing the statement as mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07219"}
