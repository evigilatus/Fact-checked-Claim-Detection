Republican Rob Cornilles is supportive; he said in last week\u2019s televised debate, about halfway throughthe program, that the project has bipartisan support.\n\n\"I do support the Keystone Pipeline. It\u2019s a bipartisan proposal. Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress want this to move forward, because it\u2019s not only a job creator, it\u2019s also a way for us to responsibly manage how that oil is transferred from Canada to Mexico.\n\nDoes the pipeline have bipartisan support?\n\nMuch of the really vocal support for this project comes from Republicans. Democrats, not so much, although there are some who want the project. Environmentalists are opposed while labor\u2019s AFL-CIO has decided not to take a formal position.\n\nSenate Democrats who like the project are Max Baucus D-Mont., Jon Tester D-Mont., Mary Landrieu D-La., Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D. \u00a0\n\nWe queried our delegation. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley are opposed. Rep. Earl Blumenauer was among 32 House Democrats who sent a letter urging the State Department\nto reject the route. Schrader is opposed to the expedited process, but not necessarily against \u2014 or for \u2014 the project.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t think the support of one Democrat or one Republican makes a proposal bipartisan,\nbut it\u2019s clear some Democrats are on board with the project. If we had to picture a bipartisan meter, the needle probably would surpass the halfway mark but fall short of 75 percent.\n\nWe rule the statement Mostly True: Requiring clarification that Democrats who are opposed are really opposed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11788"}
