The latest example of a misleading factoid gone viral casts restrictive gun policy as a backfiring failure, with two countries as case studies.\n\nOn one side of the post is Honduras, with a population of 8.2 million people and a government that \"bans citizens from owning guns.\" Honduras has \"the highest homicide rate in the entire world,\" the post claims.\nOn the other side is similarly populated Switzerland, which \"requires citizens to own guns\" and has the \"lowest homicide rate in the entire world.\"\nA reader wanted to know if the post\u2019s counterintuitive message is right.\nThe source of the claim was not immediately clear, though we found some examples of websites and figures repeating the message.\nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s flawed.\nPopulation \nWe\u2019ll pause on the numbers and start with an overriding issue with the post\u2019s premise. It holds up population as the sole constant that justifies comparing these countries\u2019 gun policy and violence.\nEven though Honduras and Switzerland are No. 94 and No. 96 in the CIA\u2019s list of countries by population, this metric alone is not enough reason to compare the effect of different gun control laws in either country.\nThere\u2019s really no point in comparing the challenges of Honduras, a lower middle-income country in Central America beleaguered by corruption and violence from the drug trade and gangs, to Switzerland, an affluent country nestled in western Europe.\n\"Of course, what you want to do is compare countries where everything else is the same, except for guns and gun laws, to see if guns and gun laws have any effect,\" said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u00a0\"Switzerland and Honduras are not even close to being the same in many aspects of their society that will influence the levels of violence and homicide.\"\nThe post ignores a litany of cultural, political and socioeconomic factors that play into gun violence, or a lack thereof. The gross domestic product per capita, to name one, is $2,435 in Honduras and $84,733 in Switzerland, according to the World Bank.\n\"The determinants of homicide rates are multiple and not very well understood, and guns laws may indeed be one among many, many determinants,\" said Christopher Mikton, World Health Organization technical officer for violence prevention. \"But to point them out as the sole cause is wrong.\"\nBut even if you choose to ignore the macrofactors, the post messes up the particulars, too.\nRates\nHonduras indisputably has the highest homicide rate in the world, with estimates ranging from a rate of 90.4 intentional homicides per 100,000 people in 2012, according to the United Nations, to 103.9 per 100,000 population, according to the World Health Organization. This was significantly higher than the rates of neighboring El Salvador (41.2), which has reduced its homicide rate following a truce among gangs, the UN said in its 2013 Global Study on Homicide.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority, more than 80 percent, of those homicides are linked to a firearm. Lethal shootings most often occur in urban centers and areas along the Atlantic coast and border regions, which suggests the violence is linked to drug trafficking patterns and gangs, according to a report on Honduras by the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss-based research project.\nSwitzerland\u2019s homicide rate is among the lowest in the world, but the meme goes too far in saying it\u2019s the very lowest. By the UN and WHO measures, the most recent Swiss intentional homicide rate is 0.6 deaths per population.\nSeveral countries \u2014 including Japan and Singapore, which have very strict gun laws, as well as Iceland and Luxembourg \u2014 posted lower rates than Switzerland in either one or both of the UN and WHO data sets.\nLaws\nThe post is wrong about the gun laws in each country.\nHonduras doesn\u2019t \"ban\" citizens from owning guns.\nThe Small Arms Survey says the most popular gun in Honduras is the 9mm handgun, \"which can be legally purchased and owned\" \u2014 undermining the meme\u2019s claim that Hondurans are banned from owning guns. Because this weapon is banned in nearby Mexico, the UN has said the difference in laws fosters the exchange of illegal weapons between the countries.\nAn analysis of gun laws in six Latin American countries by Insight Crime, a foundation that studies crime and policy in Central America, characterizes Honduras\u2019 regulations as \"light\" compared to the \"restrictive\" laws of Brazil and Mexico and \"moderate\" laws of Venezuela and Chile. Uruguay also has \"light\" gun control laws but an incredibly smaller homicide rate than Honduras of about 5.9 percent per 100,000 people. (It also has less organized crime.)\nThe disparity in homicide rates and gun control laws showed \"gun legislation, on its own, means little in terms of gun violence,\" the Insight Crime analysis found.\nThe gun culture in Switzerland is altogether different. The country boasts the third-highest firearm ownership per capita rate, trailing the top-ranked United States and Yemen. Honduras is No. 88.\nA 2012 Time story about Switzerland\u2019s gun culture\u00a0notes how citizens hold their right to own guns as a patriotic duty, and Swiss children often join sharpshooting groups to hone their skills.\nBut, again, Switzerland does not require \"citizens to own guns.\"\nThe government issues a gun to men for their mandatory military service, but the gun is taken home under \"carefully controlled conditions without ammunition,\" said Mikton, the WHO officer who is also Swiss.\n\"As soon as they have finished their military service \u2014 typically around 30 years of age \u2014 they have to return the gun,\" he said.\nSwiss gun laws are more strict than the post implies, though less tough than some other European Union countries. Swiss law requires mandatory background checks on civilian handgun purchases and licenses for the concealed carry of weapons, and it bans automatic weapons.\nOur ruling\nThe viral post aims to jolt readers with a counterintuitive implication: Gun laws can lead to deadly unintended consequences.\nBut the post is flawed on many levels. The comparison based on similar population size alone is shallow, and non-scientific. Moreover, Switzerland does not have the world\u2019s lowest homicide level, and the post is flatly wrong about the laws in each country.\nThis claim rates Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts   Politifact    6 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  Honduras \"bans citizens from owning guns\" and has the \"highest homicide rate in the entire world.\" Switzerland, with a similar population, \"requires citizens to own guns\" and has the \"lowest homicide rate in the entire world.\"    Viral image Internet   in a viral internet post Friday, September 25, 2015 09/25/2015    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05913"}
