Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., jumped to conclusions about former President Barack Obama\u2019s involvement in the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server following the release of a tranche of FBI messages.\nIn one of the texts messages released in a report of the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton emails by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., FBI lawyer Lisa Page told Peter Strzok, an FBI agent with whom she was romantically involved, that Obama wanted \"to know everything we\u2019re doing,\" on Sept. 1, 2016.\nThe unspecified subject Obama wanted to know everything about spurred Republican speculation.\nGaetz said in a since-deleted tweet that the message referenced the FBI\u2019s investigation of Clinton\u2019s use of a private email address while serving as secretary of state.\n\"On September 2, 2016, while the FBI was actively investigating @HillaryClinton\u2019s use of a private email server, #Page said that \u2018POTUS wants to know everything we\u2019re doing.\u2019 This assertion raises alarming questions about the extent of Obama\u2019s involvement with FBI investigations.\"\n\nBut the Wall Street Journal reported that associates of Strzok and Page said the texts were about Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election, which they were then investigating.\nWe won\u2019t speculate as to whether the Clinton emails were the subject of this text message. Instead, we were curious about the timeline of events at the FBI. Was the bureau \"actively investigating\" Clinton\u2019s emails on Sept. 2, 2016, as Gaetz said? We found no indication of that.\nGaetz\u2019s office did not respond to our initial requests for evidence, and then deleted the tweet. They later told us they had been referring to the State Department, not the FBI. The FBI declined to comment, and the State Department did not respond to our request for comment.\nTimeline\nOn July 5, 2016, then-FBI director James Comey announced of the Clinton email server investigation that, \"After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the FBI is completing its investigation and referring the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision.\"\n\"Although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,\" Comey said.\nOn Oct. 28, 2016, Comey made an unexpected announcement in a letter to several members of Congress.\n\"In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,\" Comey wrote. \"I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\"\nComey was referring to messages found on Anthony Weiner\u2019s seized computer, where investigators were looking into whether Weiner had committed a crime by sexting a teenage girl.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order \u201cfor all federal vehicles\u201d to be electric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey discovered that Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s top aide and Weiner\u2019s wife, also used that laptop to communicate with Clinton, so they decided to investigate whether there was any classified information in them.\nRe-opened?\nJason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chaired the House Committee on Oversight in 2016, tweeted, \"FBI Dir just informed me, \u2018The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u2019 Case reopened.\"\nBut Comey never used the word reopened because, as NBC News\u2019 Pete Williams reported, the case had never been officially closed. But that doesn\u2019t mean the case was being actively investigated.\n\"FBI officials told us that as a technical matter, it had not been closed,\" Williams told PolitiFact. \"As I recall, some of the evidence had yet to be returned to the owners, for example, and there were other administrative issues. It would have been incorrect, we were told at the time, to say that the investigation had been \u2018closed,\u2019 which is something of a term of art at the FBI.\"\n\"But that is not to say that the email matter was still being \u2018actively investigated\u2019 when the emails were discovered,\" Williams added. \"Just because it wasn\u2019t formally closed didn\u2019t mean it was being actively investigated. It wasn\u2019t an either/or.\"\n\"Comey\u2019s July announcement would mean that whatever those agents were doing, it was not working towards making the decision of whether or not to file charges,\" said Artin Afkhami, an associate editor at Just Security.\n\"The key point here, in other words, is not that Comey is \u2018reopening\u2019 a closed matter because of some bombshell,\" Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of Lawfare, wrote at the time. \"It is that he is amending his public testimony to Congress that the FBI is done while the bureau examines new material that may or may not have implications for investigative conclusions previously reached.\"\nState Department\nGaetz\u2019s office told us that after taking a closer look at our request for evidence, they deleted the tweet and corrected the statement to say the State Department, not the FBI, had been actively investigating the server on Sept. 2, 2016.\nIn that case, Gaetz\u2019s office would be correct. The State Department reopened their investigation of Clinton\u2019s emails on July 7, 2016, following a pause as the FBI investigated. We found no evidence they had finished their investigation at the time of the text message.\nRenato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, said it would not make sense for FBI agents to have been texting about the State Department investigation.\n\"The State Department and the FBI conduct separate investigations,\" Mariotti said. \"The State Department has different personnel, different records and different reports. In other words, if an agent was assigned to the State Department investigation, their evidence and reports would be distinct from the FBI.\"\nOur ruling\nGaetz tweeted, \"On September 2, 2016, while the FBI was actively investigating @HillaryClinton\u2019s use of a private email server, #Page said that \u2018POTUS wants to know everything we\u2019re doing.\u2019\"\nWe found no evidence the FBI was actively investigating Clinton\u2019s server on Sept. 2, 2016.\nThe case had not been officially closed, but reporting indicates the investigation had ceased until the Weiner emails were discovered through a separate FBI investigation.\nGaetz\u2019s office since deleted the tweet and said they meant the State Department, not the FBI. The State Department investigation was active then, but it would have been strange for FBI agents to discuss a separate agency\u2019s investigation.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-12 21:53:46 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  The \"FBI was actively investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server\" on Sept. 2, 2016.
