Aftab Pureval wants voters to promote him to Congress. To get that job, he\u2019d have to oust an incumbent in Ohio\u2019s 1st Congressional District, which includes parts of Cincinnati.\nDoes he deserve the job? Not at all, says the incumbent, Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot. As proof, Chabot cites a \"projected $400,000 deficit\" in Pureval\u2019s current office as the Hamilton County, Ohio, clerk of courts. It was the first deficit projection in years, Chabot\u2019s campaign says, showing that the challenger can\u2019t even handle his current job.\nPureval disputes the claim. But his denial prompted a counterclaim in a Chabot ad that started airing Sept. 6. In the ad, an announcer says, \"Aftab\u2019s lying about his office\u2019s $400,000 projected deficit.\"\nWas there a projected deficit? If it was projected, did the numbers come in as expected? Was the clerk of courts responsible for this gap? And did Chabot characterize the budget accurately?\nThe answers offer a look into the budget complexities of Ohio county government, and the perils of shoehorning an attack into a 30-second TV ad.\nPureval\u2019s clerk budget\nThe clerk of court manages a lot of the administrative functions of local courts, including collection of fines and fees. That\u2019s the revenue side, and frankly, it\u2019s largely dependent on the people who owe fines and not the business acumen of the clerk.\nThe clerk has a staff to pay and administrative office expenses that require money. That\u2019s the expense side.\nThe clerk\u2019s office has historically taken in more money than needed to cover its expenses, so it has turned over the surplus to help the county take care of other needs.\nBut a set of Hamilton County general fund budget projections for 2018 showed a recorded shortfall of more than $500,000: $12.023 million in projected revenue but $12.532 million in expenses.\nThat was according to Hamilton County Administrator Jeff Alluotto\u2019s budget recommendation to county commissioners presented on Oct. 16, 2017. Those projections were the basis for Chabot\u2019s claim.\nConsidering previous surpluses in the clerk\u2019s office and Pureval\u2019s time in the office so far, two years, \"I think it\u2019s mismanagement of the office,\" Cody Rizzuto, Chabot\u2019s campaign spokesman, told PolitiFact. In two years, he said, Pureval has \"turned it into a deficit operation.\"\nNo deficit, clerk\u2019s office says\nPureval\u2019s campaign say there will be no deficit. It forwarded a memo from Rene Cheatham, the chief financial officer in the clerk\u2019s office, to Pureval saying as much. The Sept. 6 memo said, \"After discussions with Hamilton County\u2019s budget and finance departments, we have revised projections\" for the general fund.\nNow the clerk\u2019s projected revenue for the fund is $12.67 million. The projected expenditures are now $12.47 million, the memo says. Viewed this way, the numbers show a surplus.\n\"As confirmed by Hamilton County, there is no projected deficit for the Clerk\u2019s office,\" Cheatham, who works for Puerval, wrote in a memo.\nPureval campaign manager Sarah Topy added in an email to PolitiFact: \"Let me be absolutely clear that there is no deficit at the Clerk's office -- there never was and there never has been. The Cincinnati Enquirer even wrote a correction that made that point and that also pointed out (correctly) that Aftab Pureval has nothing to do with the revenue generation from the courts.\"\nThe newspaper\u2019s correction was a result of a July 7 guest column that said Pureval \"inherited a clerk's office that had been operating with multi-million dollar surpluses for at least 10 years. In just over a year, he has turned those surpluses into a roughly half-million dollar deficit.\"\nThe correction, an unusual five paragraphs, said Pureval is projected to be under budget in 2018, \"which is a savings to taxpayers.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Boehner\n\n\nstated on July 15, 2010 in an op-ed in the Detroit News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since February 2009, our economy has lost roughly 3 million private sector jobs while the federal government has grown by more than 400,000 jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sabrina Eaton \u2022 July 15, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart making sense\nHow can these figures and interpretations differ so dramatically?\nCheatham and other county officials walked us through it, but we also found it in quarterly county budget documents and other records. Two reasons explain the difference. First, money coming into Pureval\u2019s office has little to do with how he operates, because it \"is all driven by fees and fines,\" Budget Director John P. Bruggen told us. \"It\u2019s stuff that has nothing to do with the day-to-day operation of the clerk\u2019s office.\"\nSecond, the general fund -- the one that Chabot said shows Pureval had a projected deficit and was \"lying\" about it -- is not the entirety of the clerk\u2019s budget. It is the major part, and it is called the \"general fund\" because it is integrated into the county\u2019s overall budget or general fund, available for transfers in and out of other departments as county budget officials deem necessary if it shows a surplus.\nBut the clerk also has a so-called restricted fund, with money coming from auto-title transfer fees. The clerk operates title offices to collect these fees. Under Ohio law, this money need not be transferred to the general fund, although typically money not needed for operating the title operations is. In 2017, for example, the clerk's office\u00a0transferred $1.7 million from this restricted fund to the general fund, therefore boosting the clerk\u2019s overall general-fund balance and helping pay for other county needs.\nThis year was going to be different, and that\u2019s why it looked like the clerk\u2019s general fund was going into the red.\nPureval wanted to use more of the auto title fund in the short term to \"drive more revenue\" for the long term by boosting\u00a0auto titling and other business, especially for customers outside of the downtown area, Cheatham said. A number of auto dealers have showrooms in exurban areas bordering other counties, and if those dealerships find it more convenient to transfer titles in those other counties, Hamilton County doesn\u2019t get the fee, Cheatham said.\nSo for 2018, the clerk\u2019s office planned to transfer only $700,000 from this restricted fund to the general fund, and to spend more of the restricted fund\u00a0on such things as expanded\u00a0hours,\u00a0Saturday operations and passport processing. The office has been talking about adding new locations. In the long run, the thinking was, the expansion would more than pay for itself.\nThat\u2019s a big reason the clerk\u2019s general fund showed a gap. This was confirmed in county budget documents. The documents for 2018 said the clerk\u2019s auto title fund was \"anticipating an increase in total balance by year end.\" This would\u00a0mean, the county documents said, \"a decrease in the General Fund transfer by $1 million.\"\nThose plans changed, however.\nHow these tie together\nInstead of planning to transfer $700,000 from the restricted fund to the general fund this year, Pureval\u2019s office this summer\u00a0decided to transfer an additional $700,000, for a total of $1.4 million. The expansion of hours, new services and title offices is ongoing, Cheatham said, but it is occuring in a way that allows for a bigger transfer to the county this year.\u00a0Doing so makes strategic sense, he said.\nBut it also changed projections for the general fund, removing what Chabot called a \"deficit.\"\nThis decision was discussed internally in July and formally made in August.\u00a0 It is true that in earlier Hamilton County\u00a0budget updates,\u00a0issued in April and July, the clerk's\u00a0general fund still showed a projected gap. And Chabot\u2019s campaign noticed that a public announcement and memo\u00a0from Pureval's office -- an announcement with updated general fund figures and the statement that there is no deficit -- was only issued on Sept. 6, right as\u00a0Chabot was making his campaign claim. Pureval\u2019s timing was\u00a0suspicious, Chabot\u2019s campaign said.\n\"He\u2019s just fiddling with numbers to protect against a political attack,\" said Rizzuto. Rizzuto called it \"absolute corruption\" for a county official running for Congress to make a decision involving county funds when attacked, considering \"he could have done this six months ago.\" Furthermore, Rizzuto said, the county commissioners will have to approve any such transfer at the end of the year, and there\u2019s no guarantee they will.\nBut there's something Chabot's campaign apparently\u00a0missed: The decision to make the transfer from the auto title fund, as well as\u00a0the necesessary legal approval from Hamiton County commissioners,\u00a0all had been made earlier.\nPolitiFact had to do some digging and request internal records in order to confirm this, but those records show\u00a0that the clerk's office sent a transmittal form to the county auditor's office in order to initiate the transfer\u00a0on Aug. 2. The county commissioners, a board on which Chabot once served, then approved the transfer at their public meeting on Aug. 29.\u00a0Jacqueline Panioto, the clerk for the board of county commissioners, confirmed this and pointed us to the board meeting's minutes where it was recorded.\nEach of these actions -- the discussions to make the transfer and the approval for the transfer -- occurred before Chabot made his claim.\nOur ruling\nSteve Chabot says Aftab Pureval\u2019s is \"lying\" about his office\u2019s \"$400,000 projected deficit.\"\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you no doubt understand this is a tricky claim. Some budget documents showed the Hamilton County clerk of courts office with a projected shortfall of actually more than $500,000, but the county\u2019s budget director said the deficit was really only on paper. It was also a temporary projection. As explained above, Pureval's office -- in agreement with other offices including the county commissioners' -- had\u00a0wiped out the\u00a0projected general fund gap well before Chabot made his ad.\nIt\u2019s complex stuff. But Chabot is a congressman and a former Hamilton County commissioner.
