It was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Sites like Twitter and I have similar brochures attributed to Mueller. But after searching the Internet, we couldn't find any legitimate sources that Muller had already said. On January 11, 2021, Facebook was published in Nancy Belusi's newspaper, no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives, by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, we found several sources that attributed the quote to someone with a similar name: Robert Muller, former Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations. Sources include an article in Facebook 2013 and books such as \"On the Way to the Future: Daniel's Visions and the Hope of the Believers,\" published in 2014 by Ray Steadman, a priest from California who writes about Bible prophecies. Paulette Fuckett couldn't confirm that Muller said that either. The United Nations did not respond immediately to questions about the validity of the quotation, and we found no reliable reference. What seems clear is that the quote attributed to Robert Mueller (one \"e\") was chosen by Robert Mueller's critics (two \"e\"). But as far as we can tell, your lawyer never said that.
