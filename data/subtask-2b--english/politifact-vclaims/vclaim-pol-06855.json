Richard Burr, R-N.C., now in charge of Senate oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency, it\u2019s unclear how much the CIA\u2019s torture legacy will remain in the spotlight. But leave it to Doonesbury to pipe up with a reminder that enhanced interrogation came with an enhanced price tag.\nIn Sunday\u2019s Jan. 11 strip, the debauched character Duke, now a K Street lobbyist, looks up from his newspaper in surprise.\n\"It turns out that before 9/11, the CIA didn\u2019t have any real torture experience,\" Duke says. \"So they hired these two psychologists, Dr. Jessen and Dr. Mitchell, to develop and run their torture program. For which they were paid $81 million!\"\nA reader asked us if that was accurate, and we can report that in large part, it is.\nWhen asked for his source, Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau told PunditFact \"this one is an easy Google,\" and sent us a Wikipedia link.\nWe looked at the report from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and found the key details on page 18.\n\"The CIA contracted with two psychologists to develop, operate, and assess its interrogation operations,\" the report said. \"In 2005, the psychologists formed a company specifically for the purpose of conducting their work with the CIA. Shortly thereafter, the CIA outsourced virtually all aspects of the program. In 2006, the value of the CIA's base contract with the company formed by the psychologists with all options exercised was in excess of $180 million; the contractors received $81 million prior to the contract's termination in 2009. In 2007, the CIA provided a multi-year indemnification agreement to protect the company and its employees from legal liability arising out of the program. The CIA has since paid out more than $1 million pursuant to the agreement.\"\nThe Senate report did not name the two psychologists, but many news reports did. The Los Angeles Times reached James Mitchell at his home in Land O\u2019 Lakes, Fla. The paper reported that Mitchell rejected the committee\u2019s description of his work.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Go ahead and smear me if you want,\" Mitchell told the Los Angeles Times. \u2018A lot of what's written in the Senate \u2026 report is just flat-out wrong. It's taken out of context.\" (We're attempting to reach Mitchell; if we hear from him, we'll let you know.)\nThe Los Angeles Times described how\u00a0Mitchell\u2019s colleague Bruce Jessen was on hand in 2002 when an Afghan detainee was stripped and dragged down a hallway. The detainee was later found dead in an unheated cell and an autopsy concluded that he likely froze to death.\nThere are some details the cartoon doesn't go into that are worth noting. First,\u00a0Mitchell and Jessen\u2019s company had a total of seven owners. So presumably the two men weren't the only people receiving money. Second, the $81 million isn't pure profit.\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Los Angeles Times,\u00a0the money covered a range of expenses. Mitchell and Jessen's company \"provided interrogators, operation psychologists, debriefers and security guards\" to CIA secret prisons. The final payments included\u00a0$75 million for services and\u00a0$5 million in case the company\u00a0faced criminal prosecution or other legal liability, the\u00a0Los Angeles Times said.\nOur ruling\nDoonesbury, aka Garry Trudeau, said that the CIA paid two psychologists $81 million to develop and run its torture program. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report confirms the amount of money spent on a variety of things. Other news organizations revealed the actual names of the two men -- though in reality seven people owned the company.\nThe claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly\u00a0True.\n\nHelp fund PolitiFact\u2019s Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06855"}
