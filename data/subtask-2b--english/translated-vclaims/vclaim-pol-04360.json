Clinton said, \"I will not allow the privatization of VA\" on September 7, 2016, during the White Sea Forum, the New York Aerosphere Museum and Space. \"I think there's an agenda there, supported by my opponent, to do just that. I think that would be very disastrous for our veterans.\" We asked whether the Republican candidate Donald Trump proposed or supported privatization of the United States Veterans Health Care System. Why can we learn from these questions? \"I never said to take the Deputy Director, take the Veterans Department, especially.\" Trump added: \"I won't do it.\" \"I think, when you wait in line six or seven days, you should never be in a position like that. When you get out, you see a (private) doctor getting yourself taken care of.\" Trump's comments are consistent with what he said earlier, and Clinton's concerns about privatization are a talking point for a misguided democracy. In July, Democratic Vice President Tim Kane said that \"Donald Trump is a man who called for privatization.\" What we found back then, and what remains now, is that Trump wants to give veterans access to private service providers when faced with delays in the vice president's post. When we called the Clinton campaign about her statement, spokesman Josh Shorn sent us several references where Trump's plan was described as some degree of privatization and Trump's explicit promise to give veterans the opportunity to go elsewhere for care. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 \"All veterans will receive timely and high-quality medical care. On July 11, 2016, Trump pledged a speech in Virginia Beach, Va. \"The right of veterans to choose their doctor and clinic should be guaranteed, either in the VA facility or in a special medical centre. We must extend this right to all veterans, not just those who cannot get a 30-day appointment or who live more than 40 miles from VA hospital, which is unfortunately the current policy and error. Of course, logistics on how to achieve this is another. Trump has talked about allowing VA patients to go to any doctor or health-care facility that accepts medical care and to get treatment there immediately. The prosecutor will pay for the bill. The experts with whom we spoke raised several issues in the Trump Plan and also discussed whether the Trump Plan should be considered a partial privatization. One concern is that non-combatants service providers do not have the same level of experience as the Special Adviser in addressing the health issues of veterans - including combat injuries, combat-related diseases, and mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder. There is also concern that allowing veterans to go anywhere to care for them would lead to fragmented, uncoordinated care and lower quality. Our referee Clinton said Donald Trump supports privatization of the Veterans' Health Care System. Trump supports the granting of more privatized care in cases where hospitalization is delayed or insufficient. In some cases, he talked about giving veterans a choice that included doctors and hospitals outside the system. But this is not like privatization of the system, which would get the government out of treatment work. Trump never suggested that. Because the Clinton statement contains some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, and we often appreciate it wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e782bf2-269d-45f2-9c69-c527093c99f2", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04360"}
