But McCain cherry-picks from her comments and incorrectly suggests she flip-flopped on how well the surge has worked and that she was prompted to support a troop withdrawal because of the recent criticsm.\n\nIn fact, she made that point in the original speech, as well as in Wednesday's statement.\n\n\nOn Monday, Clinton made headlines when she told the annual meeting of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Kansas City that, \"We've begun to change tactics in Iraq, and in some areas, particularly in al Anbar province, it's working.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

McCain's statement does not mention that part of her speech.\n\n\nOn Aug. 22, Clinton's Senate office issued a statement saying she hasn't changed her position: \"The surge was designed to give the Iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution to the situation. It has failed to do so\u2026. It is abundantly clear that there is no military solution to the sectarian fighting in Iraq. We need to stop refereeing the war, and start getting out now.\"\n\n\nIndeed, Clinton introduced legislation in February in the Senate, S. 670, to withdraw troops from Iraq.\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
