Separately, \u00a0Nazgol Ghandnoosh of the Sentencing Project, which says it focuses on reforms in sentencing policy, also laid out the methodology.\nAs a result, we built a chart demonstrating that Hannity accurately drew his numbers from data presenting percentages of 32 federal offenses for which citizens, non-citizens and, in particular, \"illegal aliens\" were sentenced in fiscal 2015.\nGhandnoosh said by email that Hannity\u2019s percentages regarding five of the federal crimes accurately tracked the commission tallies.\nIn general, those classified as \"illegal aliens\" accounted for 25,670, or 37 percent, of 70,225 individuals convicted of all federal crimes in the 12 months through September 2015. That includes 18,782 sentenced for immigration offenses.\nThe \"illegal alien\" category accounted for the following share of convictions in the crimes cited by Hannity:\n\u2022 1,640 of 2,181 total convictions (75 percent) in which the primary charge was simple drug possession.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 13 of 43 convictions (30 percent) for kidnapping/hostage taking.\n\u2022 21 of 100 convictions (21 percent) for \"national defense\" crimes, which include convictions for exporting arms, munitions or military equipment without a license or providing material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations or for terrorist purposes, per a 2013 commission report.\n\u2022 3,555 of 19,989 convictions (18 percent) for drug trafficking.\n\u2022 69 of 665 convictions (10 percent of them, for money laundering.\n\u2022 5 of 91 convictions, or 5.5 percent, for murder.\nMwonyonyi noted another aspect by pointing out to us that 73 percent of all the \"illegal alien\" federal offenders in the year--that is, 18,782 of 25,670 individuals--were primarily sentenced for immigration violations unique to the federal government. \"If you take out the immigration crimes,\" Mwonyonyi wrote, \"you find that illegal aliens committed about 14% of all non-immigration federal crimes.\"\nSliced another way, the commission tallies show U.S. citizens drew 51 percent or more of all convictions across 29 offense categories including manslaughter (96 percent U.S. citizens); murder (84 percent); sexual abuse (95 percent); robbery (98 percent); drug trafficking (74 percent); bribery (93 percent); money laundering (76 percent); racketeering/extortion (87 percent); child pornography (96 percent); and burglary/breaking and entering (100 percent).\nNotably too, Hannity\u2019s chart presents percentages of unauthorized immigrants convicted of selected federal crimes--not exploring the residency statuses of the far greater number of U.S. residents prosecuted by state and local authorities. That's probably leaving out a lot of people. For instance, as of August 2016, Texas alone held some 146,800 state prison inmates. As we completed this fact check, federal prisons altogether held nearly 193,000 inmates.\nOur ruling\nHannity's slide states that in fiscal 2015, \"illegal immigrants\" represented 5 percent to 75 percent of U.S. residents convicted of five federal crimes ranging from murder to simple drug possession.\nThose figures accurately reflect federal data though a comprehensive picture would arguably fold in individuals convicted on similar state and local charges.\nWe rate the statement True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.
