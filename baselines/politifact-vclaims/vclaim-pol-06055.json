Because if I had not asked for my emails all to be made public, none of this would have been in the public arena. But I want people to know what we did, I\u2019m proud of the four years I was secretary of state.\"\nWe know that Clinton did ask the State Department to release her emails, and they are now being released on a rolling basis. But it isn\u2019t quite right to say that if she hadn\u2019t made that request, her emails would not now be \"in the public arena.\"\nA quick refresher on how and when this aspect of the email story unfolded:\n\nMarch 3: The New York Times broke the story that Clinton did not use a government email account for her entire tenure at the State Department.The story indicated it was unclear if the emails would be made public.\nMarch 4: Clinton tweeted, \"I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.\"\nMarch 5: Secretary of State John Kerry said in a press conference that the department was already reviewing the emails for release. Additionally, the State Department press office sent out a notice to reporters specifically responding to Clinton\u2019s tweet that day.\nMay 21: The State Department released the first batch of Clinton emails.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s decision to release the emails as soon as possible was a response to Clinton\u2019s specific request. But even if she had not made that request, there were other people pushing to make the emails public.\nWhen the story broke, numerous media outlets and conservative organizations had already submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the State Department, looking for various records (including emails) connected to Clinton. Up until that point, the State Department had yet to produce the vast majority of those records.\nNotably, Jason Leopold of Vice filed a FOIA request in November 2014 asking for all of Clinton\u2019s emails, among other records, and he filed a lawsuit in January 2015 because of the State Department\u2019s slow response. The State Department\u2019s May 2015 response to Leopold\u2019s lawsuit said the release of Clinton\u2019s emails would satisfy a large portion of his FOIA request.\nIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that these FOIA requests would have eventually made the emails public, whether or not Clinton made her own request.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer emails, at least in part, might have been made public sooner, had she not exclusively used the private email address. Until Clinton turned over her emails to the State Department in December 2014 -- at the department\u2019s behest -- the department did not have the full set of emails in its possession. This made Clinton\u2019s emails basically inaccessible to FOIA requests until then. This wouldn\u2019t have been the case if she used a government email address.\nTake the case of Gawker: In 2013, Gawker filed a FOIA request for emails between Clinton and long-time adviser Sid Blumenthal after a hacker revealed emails that Blumenthal sent Clinton. Although the emails were already known to the public, the State Department told Gawker that no such correspondence existed.\nIn a previous article, we spoke with several experts who said Clinton\u2019s email setup was tailor-made to circumvent FOIA requests.\nAdditionally, Clinton\u2019s phrasing is disingenuous. It implies that requesting her emails to be made public was a proactive measure, in the interest of transparency and highlighting her record as secretary of state. Rather, it was reactive -- a response to the New York Times article that broke the story and its aftermath. If Clinton\u2019s email practices hadn\u2019t come to light, it\u2019s possible she would never have made such a request.\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"If I had not asked for my emails all to be made public, none of this would have been in the public arena.\"\nThe shred of truth here is that Clinton\u2019s request was the driving force behind the State Department\u2019s decision to release the emails as soon as possible. However, multiple pending FOIA requests for her emails likely would have made some of these emails public regardless.\nIt\u2019s disingenuous for Clinton to treat her request as proactive transparency, when her practices protected her email from public scrutiny until she was out of office.
