Gretchen Whitmer continues to be criticized personally over her stay-at-home orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 even when she\u2019s relaxing them.\nSocial media posts have questioned how faithfully she\u2019s following her own orders and guidance. We rated as False a claim that the governor was with her family on May 20 at her second home. Also False was a claim that Whitmer was on Mackinac Island, a popular Michigan vacation spot, on May 24, \"ignoring mask and social distancing rules.\"\nWith the rules now relaxed in some areas, the governor\u2019s motives, too, are coming under question. A May 20 Facebook post claimed: \"So, the governor opened up Traverse City so she could have her daughter's open house this weekend. Imagine that.\"\nThe post (archived here) was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The order applied to the entire Upper Peninsula and the northern reaches of the Lower Peninsula.\nThe latter region, referred to as the \"Traverse City Region\" in the state\u2019s reopening plan, includes Traverse City, a tourism hub located on a bay near the Lake Michigan shoreline, about 180 miles northwest of the capital, Lansing.\nThe order allowed for the opening of retail stores, restaurants, bars and some offices, and permitted social gatherings of up to 10 people. But it also included restrictions, such as limiting restaurant seating to 50% of normal capacity.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitmer and her husband, Marc Mallory, have five children \u2014 including Whitmer\u2019s older daughter, Sydney Shrewsbury, a graduating high school senior.
