Michele Bachmann said President Barack Obama might be to blame for the Fort Hood shootings.", "truth_label": "pants-fire", "date": "stated on April 2, 2014 in a Facebook meme:", "title": "Facebook post says Michele Bachmann said 'we have zero proof' Obama is not behind Fort Hood shootings", "text": "U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is clearly no fan of President Barack Obama. In recent weeks, like most weeks, she skewered his administration\u2019s handling of the Benghazi attack, the IRS scrutiny of tea party groups and the health care law.\nA Facebook meme suggests she also took to the airwaves to sort of blame Obama for the shootings by an Iraq War veteran at Fort Hood, Texas, that resulted in four deaths and 16 injuries.\n\"I\u2019m not saying Obama is responsible for the Fort Wood (sic) shooting. I\u2019m just saying that we have zero proof that he isn\u2019t,\" Bachmann is quoted as saying on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show April 2, 2014.\nA reader asked us if this post, which he said he saw on Facebook, is real.\nIt\u2019s not.\nThe first clue that something is fishy: The post refers to Fort Wood, not Fort Hood.\nThe second: The screenshot that serves as the backdrop for the quote is from Bachmann\u2019s June 2013 interview on Fox News\u2019 Hannity when she discussed her decision to leave Congress at the end of her term in January.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBachmann was not on Hannity\u2019s show on April 2, 2014, the date attributed to the quote. She did appear on The O\u2019Reilly Factor on April 3, but it was to talk about her questioning of a former CIA official over the Benghazi attacks. She didn\u2019t say the quote in question there either.\nA Lexis Nexis review of recent transcripts shows she has not commented about the attacks on the army base beyond this tweet saying she was praying for the Fort Hood community.\n\"Congresswoman Bachmann never said that quote, and didn\u2019t even appear on Hannity that day. It\u2019s 100 percent fake,\" said her spokesman Dan Kotman.\nHe pointed out that the same Facebook group where this meme was shared, the satirical Christians for Michele Bachmann, was also behind a widely shared and debunked post alleging Bachmann said Jesus wrote the Bible in English.\nBachmann may not blame Obama for the shooting, but conservative blog Gateway Pundit did, writing, \"The Obama administration is responsible for this mass shooting. They witnessed this before. They didn\u2019t learn a thing. Gun free zones are death zones.\" The post was referenced by hosts of Fox & Friends on April 3.\nBut that wasn\u2019t Bachmann. We can\u2019t find a trace of her saying, \"I\u2019m not saying Obama is responsible for the Fort Wood shooting. I\u2019m just saying that we have zero proof that he isn\u2019t.\" And she wasn\u2019t on Hannity on the night the posts says she was.\nThe post appears to be satire, but not everyone has taken it that way -- all you have to do is read the comments on the original photo. That's why we're stepping in.\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08009"}
