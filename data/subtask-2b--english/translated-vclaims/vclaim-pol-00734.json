As at 11 April, there were 555 confirmed measles cases in 20 states, compared with 465 cases in 19 states eventually. It is the second highest number of reported cases in the United States since measles was eradicated in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another claim against the vaccine has now appeared on Facebook on a page called Greeninfo.com, which describes itself as \"an alternative and comprehensive health service.\" The article says, \"Think of common doses of vaccines tested? They don't have them. Not once. Never. Our children deserve the best.\" This article, which does not provide any details or evidence, has been shared more than 600 times since 15 April and has been referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misinformation in the news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let's cut to the chase: The allegation is wrong - all vaccines are tested for years before and after they are made available to the public, including \"mixed doses.\" We contacted Daniel Salmon, Director of the Vaccine Safety Institute at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, about the health of the prosecution. \"This isn't a real statement\" told us in an e-mail. Salmon referred to us in December 2008 from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The audit covered federal vaccine safety programmes and public health activities.\" The summary begins: vaccine safety is assessed through a network of diverse and integrated activities covering the responsibilities of federal agencies and involving the private sector and academic investigators. The development, licensing and widespread use of the vaccine involves activities and programmes from a wide range of groups, including government health departments, academia, industry, health-care providers, professional organizations, third parties paying for the vaccine, managed care organizations, charitable organizations and services, and agencies within the Ministry of Health and Humanitarian Services, including the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Programme for the Compensation of Vaccine Injury in the Management of Health Resources and Services. According to the Health and Humanitarian Services Vaccine Safety page, coordinated by the National Vaccine Programme Office, each vaccine is licensed and recommended for years of safety testing. This includes testing and evaluation prior to the authorization and recommendation of the vaccine, as well as monitoring after recommendation to the public. \"Before the vaccine is ever recommended for laboratory testing. This process may take several years. The Food and Drug Administration uses information from these tests to determine whether the vaccine test is with people,\" says the page. \"During a clinical trial, a vaccine is tested for people who volunteer for vaccination. The clinical trials start from 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually involve thousands of volunteers.\" According to the Multiple Vaccine Information page of the CDC, data show that access to several vaccines at the same time does not cause any chronic health problems. The CDC says, \"When each new vaccine is licensed, it is tested alongside the vaccines already recommended for an elderly child.\" Many of these clinical tests are available for review through the American National Library of Medicine. The following are a small number of combination doses of vaccine: MMR-V with Hep-V vaccine; Hep-B (2006) with PRV (2009) PPCV-13 with infant vaccines (2010) PHD-CV and MMRV (2010); Hep vaccine with MMRV (2011); Gardasil with Minactra and Adasil (2011); VAQTA with/without management of other children &apos; s vaccines in the United States (2018) Vaccination testing, conducted individually and in conjunction with other vaccines, is a well-documented, years-long process that is crucial for the approval of vaccines worldwide.
