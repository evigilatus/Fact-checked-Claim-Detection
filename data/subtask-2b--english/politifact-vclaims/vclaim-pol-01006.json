Bruce Rauner during the state\u2019s historic budget impasse.\nNow, she\u2019s out with an interactive ad attacking rival Bill Daley for not taking a similar stand during the two years when Illinois operated without a budget after he served on the Republican governor\u2019s transition team following the 2014 election.\nThe ad, a website in the style of the game show Jeopardy, invites viewers to play \"The Daley Trouble\" and \"learn more about Bill\u2019s background.\" The answer to all the categories is, of course, \"Who is Bill Daley?\"\nOne of them, titled \"Rauner Budget Crisis,\" offers a description that invited deeper scrutiny.\n\"After co-chairing Bruce Rauner\u2019s transition team and writing the blueprint for the governor\u2019s four years of crisis and destruction, he stood by and remained silent,\" it reads, simultaneously chiding Daley for failing to protest Rauner\u2019s actions in office and accusing him of charting the course for the now departed Republican.\nThat head-spinning logic aside, Mendoza\u2019s claim made us wonder what recommendations Daley and other co-chairs of Rauner\u2019s transition team had made in their report.\nThere\u2019s no need to relitigate the budget crisis here. As we\u2019ve pointed out in previous fact-checks, both Rauner and Democrats share responsibility for bringing it about.\nBut we were curious whether the transition report itself could be considered a \"blueprint\" for the policies Rauner pushed during those tumultuous years. The short answer is no.\n\"Generic campaign themes\"\nMendoza\u2019s ad links Daley, son of one former Chicago mayor and brother of another, to Rauner, who was defeated after one term by now Gov. J.B. Pritzker. In another Jeopardy-style tile, she also highlights a $1 million dollar donation Daley recently received from hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, a big financial backer of not just Rauner but also outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\nThe Griffin connection provides a foil for Mendoza\u2019s own well-documented confrontations with Rauner over how the state pays its bills, around which she nurtured a statewide reputation as a savvy administrator of the state\u2019s finances who could work across the aisle in Springfield to get things done.\nBut her claim that Daley somehow paved the way for the role Rauner played in the state\u2019s protracted budget impasse lacks substance.\nFor one thing, Daley did not single-handedly draft the transition team\u2019s report, as Mendoza\u2019s ad suggests. Instead, he was among a bipartisan group of 28 co-chairs who signed off on the document after consulting with business and community leaders across the state. Fellow Chicago mayoral candidate Willie Wilson was also a co-chair, along with former Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican who more recently served on Democrat Pritzker\u2019s transition team.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there is no evidence the contents of the report guided Rauner\u2019s decision to engage in a two-year squabble with the Democrat-controlled General Assembly that stymied the state\u2019s ability to pay its vendors on time and jeopardized funding for everything from social services to higher education.\nA news article published just before Rauner was sworn into office described his transition team\u2019s report as little more than a reproduction of the Republican\u2019s \"largely generic campaign themes.\" Indeed, the report itself notes the team was \"not in a position to provide specific recommendations on\u00a0budgetary solutions.\"\nTransition reports like Rauner\u2019s typically lack specifics, rendering Daley\u2019s role in the process largely ceremonial.\n\"You read into it what you want to read into it if the details aren\u2019t there,\" said Charles N. Wheeler III, who directs the Public Affairs Reporting program at the University of Illinois-Springfield and covered state politics for decades.\nWe asked Mendoza\u2019s campaign to show us where the report proposed controversial policies Rauner later sought to implement in a way that contributed to gridlock. A spokeswoman pointed us to several passages that highlighted the need to improve the state\u2019s business climate under the new administration, only one of which proposed the governor take any form of concrete action.\nThat passage urged Rauner to look into lowering workers\u2019 compensation rates, but the only specifics mentioned were suggestions he review existing legislation to ensure Illinois aligned with similar states and appoint \"highly capable workers\u2019 compensation commissioners and arbitrators.\"\nRauner did push for major changes to the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system after he took office, but little of what he sought \u2014 and did not get from a Democratic legislature \u2014 was telegraphed in the transition report tied to Daley. Among the controversial pieces of what Rauner called his Turnaround Agenda that were not included in the report: freezing property taxes, imposing term limits on lawmakers, capping the prevailing wage and establishing local \"right-to-work\" zones.\nEven the vague mention in the report of reducing workers\u2019 compensation rates wasn\u2019t an automatic non-starter with legislative Democrats, who in 2011 approved a bill aimed at reducing those costs. What Democrats later took issue with was Rauner\u2019s demand for sweeping change before giving that measure a chance to work.\nAsked to explain how Mendoza was connecting the dots between the report\u2019s loosely-defined priorities and Rauner\u2019s later decisions as the state\u2019s chief executive, her spokeswoman sent us a response that essentially repeated the ad\u2019s original claim.\nOur ruling\nSusana Mendoza\u2019s ad says that as part of the governor\u2019s transition team, Bill Daley wrote \"the blueprint\" for what she calls Rauner\u2019s \"four years of crisis and destruction.\"\nDaley helped produce a report that outlined general priorities for Rauner\u2019s incoming administration on a long list of issues. But there is no evidence that document, which was heavy on generalities but extremely light on concrete policy recommendations, guided Rauner\u2019s later actions that contributed to two years of gridlock with the Democrat-controlled General Assembly over how to govern the state.\nMendoza's claim that Daley laid the framework for Rauner\u2019s role in the state\u2019s protracted budget impasse boils down to a broad accusation of guilt by association.
