Double points if it comes from a founding father.\nAnd so we have another questionable statement posted on Facebook and attributed to the first U.S. president, George Washington.\u00a0\nThe quote reads as follows:\n\"When any nation mistrusts its citizens with guns, it is sending a clear message. It no longer trusts its citizens because such a government has evil plans.\"\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

It shows up in the introduction of the pamphlet and does not have quotation marks encasing it. Below the introduction, the author instructs readers to \"read the attached comments about \u2018The Role of Firearms,\u2019 by President George Washington and help spread their wisdom.\"\u00a0\nWhat follows is a line across the screen and a series of quotations that appear to be attributed to Washington. But at least some of those quotations are also included on Mount Vernon\u2019s spurious quotations page.\u00a0\u00a0\nBarry Popik, an etymologist and consulting editor for the Oxford English Dictionary, also researched the quote in 2014. Based on information from the Wayback Machine tool of the Internet Archive, he surmised that the quote was written around 2002.\u00a0\nWe rate this bad quote Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00211"}
