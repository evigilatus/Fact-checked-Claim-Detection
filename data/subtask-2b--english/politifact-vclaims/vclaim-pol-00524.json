Gavin Newsom claimed his administration raised the rainbow flag, a symbol of LGBTQ pride, at the state Capitol \"for the first time in our state\u2019s history\" this week.\nBut a front page newspaper photo and article from 1990 show otherwise.\nTo clear this up, we set out on a fact check.\nOur research\nThe San Francisco-based Bay Area Reporter, which serves the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities, published the article on October 18, 1990. It shows the rainbow Pride flag flying over the Capitol on National Coming Out Day, on the main pole below the national and state flags, one week earlier, on October. 11, 1990 .\n\nThe October 18, 1990 issue of the Bay Area Reporter featured a photo of the Pride flag that flew briefly at the state Capitol on October 11 for National Coming Out Day.

It cites its own report from three decades ago: \"Then-governor George Deukmejian ordered the flag to be taken down shortly after it was raised.\" The article states that police received threats from veterans who said they planned to shoot or burn the flag.\nThe Pride flag that was raised in 1990 wasn\u2019t a stunt. It was sanctioned by the Joint Rules Committee of the California Senate and Assembly, and was the result of work by LGBT state Senate staffers and activists.\n\"We followed all protocols,\" Ken Topper, who worked at the time for then-state Senate Leader David Roberti, told PolitiFact California.\n\"It wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do,\" added Michael Bosia, who also worked in the state Senate at the time and is now a political science professor at Saint Michael\u2019s College in Vermont. \"It was something that was really powerful and evocative and hopeful.\"\nThe Reporter announced in an article one week before the raising that the Rules committee approved the decision.\n\nFormer California state Senate staffer Ken Topper helped win approval to raise a Pride flag at the Capitol in 1990 / Photos courtesy of Ken Topper\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov.

This piece of our state\u2019s history deserves to be called out and recognized. \u00a0News reports from the time tell of a group of activists and legislators who quietly orchestrated the flag to be flown to commemorate National Coming Out Day. It was an act of visibility and defiance. After a short time on display, Governor Deukmejian was alerted to the flag\u2019s existence and ordered it to come down, telling media it was \"mistakenly\" raised.\" \u00a0\nEarlier this month, U.S. embassies were denied permission by the Trump administration to fly the rainbow flag in honor of the LGBTQ Pride Month, according to CNN.\nSupport for flying the flag is far greater in California. Newsom said he fully supported the effort, in contrast to Deukmejian three decades ago.\n\"In California, we celebrate and support our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community\u2019s right to live out loud \u2014 during Pride month and every month,\" Newsom said in a news release. \"By flying the pride flag over the State Capitol, we send a clear message that California is welcoming and inclusive to all, regardless of how you identify or who you love.\"\nThe news release acknowledged this isn\u2019t the first time the rainbow flag has appeared at the Capitol. \"The flag has previously been hung over balconies both inside and outside of the building and the Capitol dome was illuminated in rainbow colors in June 2015,\" it read.\nNewsom said the rainbow flag will fly atop the Capitol through July 1.\nOur rating\nNewsom claimed his administration raised the rainbow flag at the state Capitol \"for the first time in our state\u2019s history\" this week.\nA newspaper photo and article from 1990 show the flag flew atop the Capitol three decades ago, for a few hours.
