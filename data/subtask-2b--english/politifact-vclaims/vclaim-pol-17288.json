Kelly Loeffler in one of the two Georgia elections that will decide which party controls the Senate, Democrat Raphael Warnock put out an ad titled, \"The Cayman Islands.\"\u00a0\nMost of the spot sullies Loeffler for what it says was her previous work, helping banks set up offshore accounts to avoid paying U.S. taxes. Near the end, the narrator adds, \"but Loeffler\u2019s for raising taxes on Georgia\u2019s middle class.\"\nThe reference is to Loeffler\u2019s support of the 2017 tax cuts law signed by President Donald Trump, according to a citation in the ad. But the ad\u2019s characterization of Loeffler\u2019s stance is wrong. For individuals, most of the cuts enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire at the end of 2025 \u2014 meaning, after that, taxes will rise. But for the middle class, Loeffler supports making the cuts permanent.\nThe law reduces taxes on individuals \u2014 through lower tax rates and other measures \u2014 and on corporations. While most of the cuts for individuals expire at the end of 2025, the cuts for businesses are permanent.\nThe vast majority of middle-income taxpayers are getting tax cuts in the initial years of the law and even after the tax cuts expire, the net effect is roughly zero, according to estimates by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation and the centrist Tax Policy Center.\nBy 2027, though, every income group below $75,000 will see a tax increase.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElaine Luria\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a campaign finance report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn accepting corporate PAC donations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoeffler has been in the Senate a year, having been appointed to fill a vacancy. Her Senate and campaign offices did not reply to our requests for information. But she has stated support for making the tax cuts \"for working and middle class families\" permanent. In April, Loeffler proposed what she called a framework for economic growth that would include making the tax cuts permanent and other efforts, such as aiming to make and grow more products in the U.S., reducing business regulations and expanding eligibility for the Paycheck Protection Program.\nWarnock\u2019s campaign pointed out that Loeffler has not introduced legislation to make the tax cuts permanent.\u00a0\n\"I haven\u2019t seen extensions featured in much of the discussion yet, but that\u2019s not surprising, as Congress usually waits until the very last minute to decide on policies,\" said Erica York, an economist with the Tax Foundation\u2019s Center for Federal Tax Policy. \"I imagine we will see negotiations over how to handle the expirations really take off closer to 2025.\"\nOur ruling\nWarnock said Loeffler supports \"raising taxes on Georgia's middle class.\"\nLoeffler supports a law that contains tax cuts for the middle class that expire at the end of 2025, but she has been clear that she supports making the cuts permanent.\nWe rate the statement False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17288"}
