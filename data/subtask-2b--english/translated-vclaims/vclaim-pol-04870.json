But he also used the interview for a political strike, wondering about Obama's priorities. \"The President said the national security threat facing America, the highest one, is global warming,\" said Babu. \"It is not an unsafe border, not the terrorists we must fight and defeat.\" This is not the first time we've heard a statement like this: in June 2015, Goff Wisconsin. Scott Walker claimed Obama said global warming was \"no.\" \"One threat to the army and the world today\" The president said global warming was a serious threat, but it wasn't. 1. We've often misevaluated it. We wondered whether Bapu's claim carried any weight a year later. Contrary to Babu &apos; s claim, the greatest threat to national security on the part of the President appears to be terrorism. In March, after the terrorist attacks in Brussels, Obama said, \"I've got a lot of things from my class, but my top priority is to defeat ISIL. When we asked for evidence that climate change was the highest priority, Tim Gaffney, spokesperson for the Mayor of Penal County, noted that Obama had made this allegation during his speaking engagements. It was published on January 25, 2021 in a video that says Bill Gates \"at least 3 billion people must die\" from this planet. \u2022 On 27 January 2021, Obama stated that global warming posed a serious threat and linked it to national security. However, given the news reports over the past year, Obama never explicitly stated that he was the highest threat to national security. Indeed, he said that global warming posed a threat to the entire world. In a weekly speech in April 2015, he said, \"There is no greater threat to our planet than climate change.\" In May 2015, Obama also said during the beginning of the American Coast Guard Academy that climate change \"is one of the most serious threats.\" \"So I am here today to say that climate change poses a serious threat to global security, and a direct threat to our national security,\" Obama said. \"Do not make any mistake, it will affect how our army defends our country.\" We should also point out that the United States army has focused on the potential threat of climate change by returning to the administration of President George W. Bush. In an interview in December 2015, Obama defended his observations on climate change, noting at the same time that while terrorists would \"be defeated,\" climate change is \"the kind of crisis that we cannot deal with through the deployment of marines.\" Our Governor, Babu, said, \"The President said the national security threat facing America, the highest threat, is global warming.\" Obama continues to refer to climate change as a major threat to the world, but to frame the issue as the country's highest national security threat is exaggerated. Obama has said that the fight against terrorism is his most urgent priority. The Mayor of Arizona ignores the important context so we're assessing his claim as mostly wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0cb68a01-985c-4db8-96bb-cc03740e77a6", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04870"}
