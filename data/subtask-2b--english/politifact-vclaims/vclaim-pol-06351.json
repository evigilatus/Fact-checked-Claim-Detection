The presentation is scheduled for July 15 at ESPN\u2019s awards show, The ESPYs.\n\"Bruce has received many accolades over the years for being one of the greatest Olympians of our time but The ESPYS are honored to celebrate Bruce becoming Caitlyn,\" said ESPN executive producer Maura Mandt. \"She has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.\"\nThat didn\u2019t sit well with many people, who thought there were more deserving winners.\nSome thought Lauren Hill, a 19-year-old college basketball player who died of\u00a0cancer, should have won.\nA Facebook meme, meanwhile, said the runnerup was an Iraq war veteran who lost his arm and leg defending the United States. When last we looked, it had been shared more than 100,000 times.

There is \"no such thing as a runnerup for the three major awards,\" a spokesman told MTV, referring to the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, the Pat Tillman Award for Service and the Jimmy V Perseverance Award.\nESPN put out a follow-up statement on the Arthur Ashe Courage Award two days after announcing Jenner as the recipient. It reads:\n\"The Arthur Ashe Courage Award is meant to honor individuals whose contributions transcend sports through courageous action. Sometimes that courage is demonstrated over the course of a lifetime and sometimes it is demonstrated in a single act that shines a light on an important contemporary issue. \u00a0At all times, there are many worthy candidates.
