Cory Booker, as most Democratic presidential candidates, says he backs some form of Medicare for All. When pressed during an appearance on CBS to say how much the universal government health insurance program would cost, the New Jersey Democrat answered a different question.\n\"Even the (Congressional Budget Office) says if you lower Medicare to allow 50 year olds to get into it, you can not only save the government money, but you can lower premiums for all Americans,\" Booker told CBS News on Feb. 4.\nThere is no such CBO report.\nWe reached out to Booker\u2019s office, and staff told us he was drawing from a 2017 article in Health Affairs that floated the idea of mandatory enrollment in Medicare when people turn 55 \u2014 not 50, as Booker said.\nThe article also didn\u2019t predict the savings that Booker described. Insurance markets aren\u2019t simple.\nYes, pulling people ages 55 to 64 out of the private market would leave a younger and healthier population behind, which could leave room for lower premiums. Yes, putting that same age group into Medicare would reduce the average cost per person in Medicare.\nBut the government would still have to pay for the care those 55-to-64-year-olds received. With higher costs, Washington would need new revenues.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.

The Health Affairs article talked about making it mandatory at age 55.\nOur ruling\nBooker said the CBO had reported that allowing 50-year-olds into Medicare would save the government money and reduce premiums for everyone. The senator\u2019s office acknowledged there is no such CBO report.\nThe article behind Booker\u2019s statement discussed a different idea \u2014 making it mandatory for people 55 and over to switch to Medicare. While it said there would be some follow-on savings, it also said there would be higher costs, and it made no attempt to say what the net effects would be.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2019-02-08 19:27:15 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Even the (Congressional Budget Office) says if you lower Medicare to allow 50 year olds to get into it, you can not only save the government money, but you can lower premiums for all Americans.\"     Cory Booker Democratic Senator from New Jersey https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cory-booker-says-nation-needs-revival-of-civic-grace-ahead-of-2020-race/   During an interview on CBS This Morning.
