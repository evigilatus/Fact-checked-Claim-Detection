Scott Brown \"voted to give oil companies big tax breaks.\" PolitiFact found that claim Mostly True.\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019ll focus on Ayotte\u2019s votes. We\u2019ll tackle campaign contributions separately.\nThe DSCC pointed us to Ayotte\u2019s votes in 2011 and 2012 against measures that would have stripped existing tax breaks from the \"big five\" oil companies: Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips.\nThe 2011 Democratic-backed proposal would have eliminated five tax breaks for the companies and generated an estimated $21 billion over a decade, according to the \u00a0New York Times. \nThe bill that came a year later would have eliminated $24 billion in tax subsidies from the five oil companies, according to the Boston Globe.\nSpecifically, the measures would have kept those five multinational oil companies from using these existing tax breaks:\n\u2022 Deductions on taxes paid to foreign governments\n\u2022 Deductions on domestic manufacturing costs\n\u2022 Deductions for intangible drilling costs\n\u2022 Percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells\n\u2022 Deductions for qualified tertiary injectant expenses\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree of these breaks applied specifically to the oil industry. The other two -- the ones about manufacturing costs and taxes paid to foreign governments -- can be claimed by businesses other than oil companies. If passed, these five provisions would still have applied to companies beyond the \"big five\" oil firms.\nIn each of the two years, the proposal failed to advance in the U.S. Senate by margins of 52-48 in 2011 and 51-47 in 2012. The bills needed 60 votes in order to cut off debate and take a final vote.\nAyotte joined most Republicans and a handful of Democrats from oil states to oppose the measure both times it hit the Senate floor.\nThe bill\u2019s opponents sometimes cited a March 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that concluded withholding subsidies from companies could increase prices at the pump.\nIn general the ad is correct that Ayotte sided with the position of \"big oil\" when she voted against advancing the bills. But the ad\u2019s wording is misleading. It states Ayotte \"voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks.\" Ayotte really voted against stripping the companies of tax breaks they already enjoyed.\nMeanwhile, Ayotte\u2019s campaign pointed to several votes she has taken opposing tax credits for the oil and gas industry.\nOne amendment, to a highway bill, would have repealed more than a dozen various tax credits including those for alternative fuel mixtures, certain plug-in vehicles, biodiesel and renewable diesel used as fuel and electricity produced from certain renewable resources. The amendment did not propose to repeal any of the tax breaks for the \"big five\" oil companies mentioned above, but it did target two credits dealing with oil -- one for producing oil and gas from marginal wells, and another for enhanced oil recovery.\nNeither was in effect when the amendment was offered and the marginal well credit hasn\u2019t been used since its creation in 2004, according to a 2013 article from lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP.\nAyotte was one of 26 senators who voted for the amendment. It was opposed by a bipartisan group of 76 senators, including Democrat Jeanne Shaheen.\nAyotte\u2019s campaign also pointed to a February amendment that would have phased out tax credits for fossil fuels on the same schedule as those for wind farms.\nThe proposal, offered by Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, targeted many of the same existing tax breaks for \"big oil\" as the bills from 2011 and 2012. For example, it would have phased out deductions for intangible drilling costs and deductions on domestic manufacturing costs, among others.\nAyotte joined most Democrats to vote for the amendment, which was defeated 50 to 45. \nOur Ruling\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Kelly Ayotte \"voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks.\"\nIn 2011 and 2012, Ayotte did indeed vote against measures that would have barred the biggest five oil companies from taking advantage of tax breaks they already enjoyed, which added up to more than $20 billion. But that\u2019s slightly different than what the ad says.\nRather than vote to give the companies a new break, as the ad implies, Ayotte voted to support the status quo.\nAyotte\u2019s record is more complex, however, and she cast more recent votes that would have repealed some tax breaks for big oil.\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate the ad\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04180"}
