Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\"The Cuba embargo needs to go, once and for all,\" she said at Florida International University July 31.\nThe anti-Democratic America Rising PAC accused Clinton of making a \"sudden flip flop on Cuba.\"\nWell, it wasn\u2019t exactly sudden.\nWe decided to put Clinton\u2019s statements since 2000 on the embargo on our Flip-O-Meter, which doesn\u2019t pass judgment on changing stances but evaluates whether\u00a0a candidate has flipped and to what extent. Some voters see some flips as a sign of inconsistency, while others view flips as a sign that a politician has the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of constituents.\nFirst, a word about lifting the embargo, which would require action by Congress. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Helms-Burton Act which prevents the embargo from being lifted until Cuba holds free and fair elections, frees political prisoners and allows for a free press and labor unions. Cuba did release some prisoners as part of the deal with the United States but has not met all of these conditions.\n2000\nClinton spoke about Cuba in 2000 when she was running to be the U.S. senator from New York. After a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in October that year, an audience member asked Clinton for her position on the embargo.\n\"I believe before the United States should lift the embargo, Castro should make some good faith show of moving toward ending repression, freeing political prisoners and some steps toward democratization,\" she said.\nClinton also said that while she supported increasing food and medicine exports to Cuba and allowing more travel, \"I\u2019m not ready to vote to lift the embargo.\"\n2008\nDuring her first presidential bid in 2008, Clinton favored maintaining the embargo. (So did Obama at the time, though he would later change his stance.)\nIn July 2007, Obama said in a debate he would meet with Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The next day Clinton said that was \"irresponsible and, frankly, naive.\"\nIn a December 2007 debate, Clinton said: \"Until there is some recognition on the part of whoever is in charge of the Cuban government that they have to move toward democracy and freedom for the Cuban people, it will be very difficult for us to change our policy.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2008 in a statement accompanying a questionnaire released by the Cuban American National Foundation, Clinton said now is \"not the time to consider wholesale or broad changes to our Cuba policy.\"\nIn a debate on Univision in February 2008, Clinton said \"as president, I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction.\"\n2014 to 2016\nIn her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton wrote that near the end of her tenure as secretary of state, she recommended that Obama review the embargo. She wrote that the embargo \"wasn\u2019t achieving its goals, and it was holding back our broader agenda across Latin America. After 20 years of observing and dealing with the U.S.-Cuba relationship, I thought we should shift the onus onto the Castros to explain why they remained undemocratic and abusive.\"\nWhen Obama made his announcement on Dec. 17 about the change in Cuba policy, Clinton said \u00a0she supported the change.\nThe speech in Miami was Clinton\u2019s first major speech as a presidential candidate about Cuba policy. It occurred amid the backdrop of polls that show the majority of Americans support normalizing relations with Cuba.\nDuring her speech, Clinton explained that she had supported the embargo in the past. The Helms-Burton law was signed after the Cuban Air Force shot down the Brothers to the Rescue plane, killing volunteers on board.\nClinton said \"with their deaths in mind, I supported the Helms-Burton Act to tighten the embargo.\"\nBut she said that the embargo was a \"failed policy\" and said she agrees with Obama\u2019s call on Congress to drop the embargo.\n\"That last step about the embargo is crucial, because without dropping it, this progress could falter,\" she said. \"The Cuba embargo needs to go, once and for all.\"\nShe also said that if Congress won\u2019t act to make it easier for more Americans to go to Cuba, she will use her executive authority to do so.\nOur conclusion\nIn her 2000 campaign for Senate, Clinton clearly stated that she wasn\u2019t ready to lift the Cuba embargo. During her first bid for president in 2007, she repeatedly called for reforms in Cuba before any such changes to the embargo.\nBut by 2014, she was a critic of the embargo and said it hadn\u2019t achieved it\u2019s goals.\nIn a speech in Miami on July 31, Clinton forcefully stated that she believes it is time to drop the embargo.\nClinton has made a full change of position, so we rate it a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06117"}
