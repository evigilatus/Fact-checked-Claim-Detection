Jeb Bush is trying to contrast himself with Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\"My email address, write it down, and send me your thoughts, [email\u00a0protected],\" he\u2019s shown telling a crowd in an Aug. 27, 2015, campaign video (the clip is from the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines on Aug. 14). \"By the way, I just gave out my email address. It\u2019s exactly what I did when I was governor of the state of Florida. I released all my emails; I\u2019m writing an e-book about my emails.\"\nBush and Clinton have drawn criticism from campaign rivals because they both used private email accounts and servers for their government jobs.\nBut can Bush claim he\u2019s released all of his emails\u00a0as a way of drawing a distinction between himself and Clinton? No, in reality, he's done exactly what Clinton has done. Bush says\u00a0he has turned over and made public all the emails he was required to. That's the same argument Clinton is making.\nAnd like Clinton, that means we may never know with 100 percent certainty if Bush\u00a0left out any work-related emails.\nThe email trail\nClinton has faced mounting scrutiny first into whether she turned over all of her non-personal emails to the State Department, then questions about how she handled information that was eventually marked classified. Bush, meanwhile, has been very vocal about being open and transparent in his digital dealings.\nIn December 2014, he announced the website jebbushemails.com, an archive of emails from the private email address he used as Florida\u2019s governor, [email\u00a0protected].\nBush used the private address on a private server every year between 1999 and 2007, corresponding with constituents and conducting state business while using a server he owned and kept at the governor\u2019s office in Tallahassee. The archive site went live in February 2015 with a total message count his campaign has put at about 280,000.\nNow, that may sound like a lot, but they were by no means every email message Bush sent while he was governor, nor were they newly available to the public. The emails were already a part of the state archives, and could have been accessed by anyone who asked for them.\nThat\u2019s because under Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law, an official has to turn over records and emails related to government business \"at the expiration of his or her term of office.\"\nDocumentation from the Florida Department of State shows that Bush\u2019s public records were transferred to the state archives several times since November 2007. The last batch of emails was turned over in June 2014, raising a few eyebrows among critics for taking an unusually long time. The last batch of 25,000 emails was described as \"Additional 2002-2003 emails.\"\nThe American Democracy Legal Fund on Aug. 27 accused Bush of violating public records law for taking too long to turn over all his records. The group has asked the state attorney\u2019s office in Leon County to fine Bush, although the rules on how long he could take are somewhat murky.\nSo how many emails did Bush send as governor? We\u2019ve asked the state archives to confirm the exact number they have from all accounts, but have not heard back. We\u2019ll update this item if they let us know. The Bush campaign also did not confirm to us whether he meant he\u2019d released all the emails from his private server, but it\u2019s pretty clear he did not release every single one.\nWe do know that during a 2007 interview, Bush said his private server had about 550,000 messages on it, a number his campaign has since declined to confirm to PolitiFact Florida. Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told us in March that the number of emails on the server is \"immaterial as they are not subject to public records request and not required by law to be retained.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBush also guessed he had gotten about 2.5 million more emails through a public email account run by the state. We aren\u2019t really counting state account emails in this case, because the government was responsible for reviewing and archiving those.\nFirst Amendment Foundation president Barbara Petersen has told PolitiFact that state workers would have seen and vetted messages from state government accounts, and not Bush\u2019s private staff or lawyers. She thought most of the Bush emails from any official account\u00a0had been retained and made public through the state archives.\nThere also have been reports of a third account, [email\u00a0protected], which Bush\u2019s campaign has denied having.\nThe emails that Bush turned over from the private server, however, are only the ones he self-selected as pertaining to state business. He left out messages concerning politics, family matters and fundraising, which the Sunshine Law allows him to do.\nSo that means he didn\u2019t literally release all his emails, just the ones he says he was required to give the state.\nThere\u2019s nothing in the law preventing him (or an authorized custodian) from editing them down the way he did, or from using a private account. But that also leaves room for doubt as to whether he left some messages out that should have been included in the public sweep. That is no different than points raised by Clinton\u2019s detractors who have questioned whether she included all pertinent materials from her server.\nIn short, we have to take Clinton\u2019s word that she complied with the law.\nSame with Bush.\nCritics have pointed out there is a lack of correspondence among Bush\u2019s released emails about subjects ranging from the 2000 election to Terri Schiavo (the case of a Florida woman on life support who Bush and lawmakers tried to intervene to save) to voter purges, although he did discuss Florida National Guard deployments via email after Sept. 11, 2001.\nIn Florida, there are ways to investigate whether something that should have been included in public records isn\u2019t available. Petersen said someone who thinks messages are missing from a records request can sue Bush in civil court and ask a judge to inspect the server.\nBut there\u2019s no evidence Bush has violated state law. No judge has asked for an inspection to see if any messages that should have been included are missing, either.\nOur ruling\nBush said, \"I released all my emails.\"\nIn trying to draw a contrast to Hillary Clinton, Bush actually offered much of the same defense. In reality, Bush says he released all the emails he was required to under Florida law, in the same way Clinton says she turned over all the emails she was required to under federal law.\nBut Bush hasn\u2019t turned over every single email he sent as governor. While the state handled his public\u00a0account\u2019s emails, he was allowed to self-edit [email\u00a0protected] correspondence from his private server. That amounted to 280,000 emails out of a half-million or more, which Bush repackaged on a website earlier this year.\nBush\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\u00a0We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06018"}
