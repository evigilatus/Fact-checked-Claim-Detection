Bush was at the same time in his second term, says Mitch McConnell", "text": "Comity may have returned to the Senate with a deal that averted a showdown over confirmation of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees, but beforehand, passions ran high. Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., accused Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., of a naked power grab to push nominations through.\n\n\"If we do not pull back from the brink, my friend the majority leader is going to be remembered as the worst leader of the Senate ever,\" McConnell said.\n\nReid responded, \"No matter how often my friend rudely talks about me breaking my word, I am not going to respond talking about how many times he has broken his word.\"\n\nA few days after that exchange, McConnell appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press where he argued that the president\u2019s track record has been pretty good.\n\n\"What is the problem here? The president has had 1,540 of his nominations confirmed, only four defeated. He\u2019s not lost a single member of the cabinet. He\u2019s getting them faster than President Bush was at the same time in his second term,\" McConnell said.\n\nThere are actually three claims in that statement. Here, we will look at the last one, \"He\u2019s getting them faster than President (George W.) Bush was at the same time in his second term.\"\n\nWe contacted McConnell\u2019s office, and communications director Michael Brumas told us that the Senate had confirmed 28 judges, compared to 10 total by this same point in 2005.\n\nBrumas has those numbers exactly right. The only problem is that McConnell on Meet the Press did not specify that he was talking about judges. We brought this up with Brumas, and he told us that McConnell has used the comparison between Obama and Bush a number of times to describe the pace of judicial nominations.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, that\u2019s accurate. We found that just a few days earlier, McConnell made the point on the Senate floor about judges.\n\nHowever, he didn\u2019t say that during this interview. All he said was that Obama was \"getting them faster than President Bush was at the same time in his second term.\"\n\nWe wanted to see how the numbers came out when we looked at all nominations in the first year of the second terms of both presidents, up to July 14, the day McConnell was interviewed. With the guidance of Anne Joseph O\u2019Connell, associate dean at the University of California-Berkeley Law, we searched the nominations database at the Library of Congress.\n\nWe found that the Senate has confirmed 68 of Obama\u2019s nominees. By this point in the 109th Congress, the Senate had confirmed 129 of Bush\u2019s nominees, nearly twice as many.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcConnell said that the Senate had confirmed more Obama nominees than it had at the same point in Bush\u2019s term. The opposite is true. Bush had 129 confirmations compared with 68 for Obama.\n\nMcConnell should have included the detail about judges, as he has in the past, but he did not. It is unlikely that most viewers would have been able to fill in the missing words because not everyone is familiar with McConnell\u2019s talking points.\n\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09095"}
