Vice President Mike Pence reiterated it during a phone call to Republican governors that evening, recommending they use the argument as a strategy to quiet public concern about surging case tallies in some states. It\u2019s also a variation on a tweet the president sent earlier in the day.\nWith that in mind, we wanted to dig deeper. We reached out to the White House for comment or clarification, but we never heard back. Independent researchers told us, though, that the president\u2019s remarks are not only misleading \u2014 they\u2019re also counterproductive in terms of thinking through what\u2019s needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe big picture\nEssentially, the president is arguing that the United States is finding more cases of COVID-19 because we are testing more \u2013 and our increased testing makes it look like we have a worse epidemic than other countries do.\n\"We will show more \u2014 more cases when other countries have far more cases than we do; they just don\u2019t talk about it,\" he added.\nBut that isn\u2019t true.\nThe numbers paint a stark picture. The United States has recorded 2.1 million cases of the novel virus so far, about a quarter of the global total and more than any other country. To Trump\u2019s point, the country is testing more now than it did at the start of the outbreak \u2014 per capita, the U.S. is in the top 20% of countries when it comes to cumulative tests run.\nBut this beefed up testing is still likely undercounting. The problem is that the U.S. outbreak is worse than that of many other countries \u2013 so we need to be testing a higher percentage of our population than do others.\nA way to understand this: the number of tests necessary to identify a positive case. If it\u2019s easier to find a positive case, that suggests the virus has spread further and more testing is necessary to track the spread of COVID-19.\nFor instance, statistics from the United States and the United Kingdom are fairly similar in terms of how many coronavirus tests are done daily per million people. But those tests yield far more positive cases in the United States. That suggests the outbreak here requires more per-capita testing than does the U.K.\u2019s.\n\"We have a much bigger epidemic, so you have to test more proportionately,\" said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nPut another way, a larger health crisis means \u2014 even after controlling for population size \u2014 the United States will have to test more people to find out where and how the virus has spread. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while the U.S. has ramped up its testing since March, many parts of the country still don\u2019t have sufficient systems in place \u2014 from facilities to staff to medical supplies \u2014 for diagnosing COVID-19, researchers told us.\nIf we stopped testing?\nAnd what about the president\u2019s assertion that \"if we stopped testing right now, we\u2019d have very few cases\" or none at all?\nOn its literal phrasing, it\u2019s absurd, experts said.\n\"The implication that not testing makes the problem go away is completely false. It could not be more false,\" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. That\u2019s because testing doesn\u2019t create instances of the virus \u2014 it is just a way of showing and tracking them. (The president made a similar point during the same White House roundtable event.)\nBut even if you take it figuratively \u2013 the idea that our expanded testing resources have inflated our sense of the epidemic \u2013 it\u2019s still misleading.\n\"We\u2019re seeing a lot of cases because we\u2019re testing? It just doesn\u2019t ring true,\" Kates said. \"The U.S. has made a lot of progress for sure. But that job is not finished.\"\nThe president\u2019s claim is part of a larger re-election strategy, argued Robert Blendon, a health care pollster at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The idea is to suggest that the health crisis is mostly exaggerated \u2013 and that things are getting better, and Americans should feel comfortable going back to work. \"If the economy takes off, the president has a chance of re-election,\" Blendon said. \"If it contracts as a result of expansion of cases, and the only way we know how to respond is restriction of economic activity, he\u2019s gone.\"\nBut the problem, Blendon added, is that COVID-19 counts are still climbing in multiple states. And people are still dying of the virus.\nThat gets at another point: Diagnostic testing isn\u2019t the only data source to reveal the pandemic\u2019s existence. Let\u2019s not forget about hospitalization rates and death counts. The number of deaths continues to rise, and hospitalizations are higher than they would be in the virus\u2019s absence.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump argued that the nation\u2019s high count of COVID-19 cases is simply a result of our expanded testing capacity. His point is entirely incorrect.\nThe most relevant data suggests that the U.S. isn\u2019t testing enough to match the severity of the pandemic. Even with our higher testing ratio, we\u2019re probably still undercounting compared to other countries.\nTesting doesn\u2019t create the virus. Even without diagnostics, COVID-19 would still pose a problem. We just would know less about it.\nAnd in fact, eliminating testing may alter the public\u2019s perception of the pandemic, but it wouldn\u2019t conceal it. If anything, it would likely worsen the crisis, since the public health system wouldn\u2019t know how to accurately track and prevent the spread of the virus.\nThe claim has no merit and seriously misrepresents the severity of the public health crisis.
