Rick Scott for K-12's education cut. \"They don't fly in private planes or float on fancy yachts, but the work done by Florida teachers can't be more valuable. When Rick Scott reduced education by more than $1 billion, thousands of them lost their jobs, class sizes rose, and our children paid the price.\" A visual presentation of the Miami Herald 2014 article, which mentioned a reduction of $1.3 billion in public schools. \"Why did he do that?\" The announcement continues. \"To pay millions in charity to large companies. Tax cuts here, budget cuts there. Thousands of teaching jobs are gone.\" The announcement gives no indication of when those cuts in education occurred, but the answer is that the reduction of $1.3 billion K-12 was in 2011. We have already verified whether Scott has reduced education to pay tax exemptions; we have assessed them as half real. Here, we will verify the validity of the allegation regarding the consequences of budget cuts. Did thousands of teachers lose their jobs? Did the class sizes rise? In 2011, Scott entered office in 2011 due to the dismissal of teachers as a result of budget cuts, and faced a $3.6 billion shortfall in the State budget of $70.5 billion. His first budget proposal, issued at a Tea Party rally, included sharp cuts in spending, including cuts in spending on education. After a controversial session, the Legislature - Scott signed - approved a budget of $1.3 billion in reductions in education. The reduction ended with about $540 per student, resulting in a 7.9 per cent reduction in funding. (We've analysed some of these numbers before.) After facing a backlash on the cuts, Scott went backwards in the following years with increases in K-12 education, although his high spending point per pupil is still lagging behind the high water mark under Christ. So did \"thousands\" of teachers lose their jobs as a result of the 2011 budget cuts? We did not find a definitive source showing the exact number of teacher layoffs throughout the state. The Christ campaign refers to demobilization in one school area: Broward. The campaign refers to an article published in June 2012 by Sun-Santinel that states that the province \"has cancelled some 1,500 teachers\" in 2011 - but then was about to add 678 jobs in 2012. This figure is therefore less than the \"thousands\" mentioned by the campaign. A spokesperson for Broward Polyte Fact schools reported that, in June 2011, a total of 1,431 teachers were not rehired annually or on probation, but 583 were subsequently rehired. In addition, 117 teachers were placed on a demobilization list, but 97 were re-employed. This brings the total to 868 in Broward. There is a warning about Broward: State budget cuts are not the only reason for the provincial budget problems. One of the main factors in this regard was that the province faced rapid growth in school enrolment followed by a decline. Although the Christ campaign mentioned only an article on demobilization in one province, demobilization occurred in other provinces as well, including 315 teachers in Pasco province. (In Miami-Dade, almost all teachers retained their jobs, except for some temporary teachers who received poor performance reviews). School districts report to the State Ministry of Education on the number of teachers they have each year. These data show that between the autumn of 2010 and the fall in 2011 the number of teachers decreased by 1,405 or approximately 1 per cent. This was the result of an increase in the number of students between 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. By 2012, the number of teachers exceeded the 2010 level. These data do not include the amount of reduction resulting from dismissal, retirement or termination - but it is fair to assume that at least some were laid off. The initial decrease of 1,405 teachers is less than the \"thousands\" mentioned by Christ. Christ, a democracy, and Scott, a Republican, accused each other of causing the demobilization of teachers. In an announcement, Scott blamed Christ for 3,000 teachers who were laid off during his tenure as governor. This allegation was based on a report issued in September 2009 on possible layoffs. Scott omitted to declare that Christ had accepted federal stimulus funds that had kept thousands of teachers and that the Republican-controlled legislature shared responsibility with Christ for the cuts that had taken place in the midst of the national recession. We assessed Scott &apos; s claim as mostly false. The second part of the claim for the increase in the size of the categories is difficult to assess because of budget cuts because many factors constitute the size of the categories. In Florida, voters agreed to adjust the size of the class in 2002, but the state has been in stages for several years. In the first year, schools had to meet the rules at the classroom level in 2010-2011. Until that stage, the average classroom size was throughout the school, and a 2010 referendum to maintain school averages failed. The maximum limit is 18 students between kindergartens and third grade, 22 students in grades 4 to 8 and 25 students in basic secondary school classes. However, changes introduced by the Legislature during Scott's term make the comparison of compliance rates from year to year less important. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January, 2021, for example, in 2011, the Legislature reduced the number of sessions under the mandate by two thirds, requiring only the basic classes required for graduation to follow the standard. In 2013, the legislature changed the law so that the provinces could designate schools as \"optional schools\" to circumvent classroom accounts. This is what Pasco has done for her entire region, for example. The Crist campaign refers to only one piece of evidence of class sizes: the 2011 Miami Herald article, which mentioned some stories about very large chapters in Miami-Dade, including 54 students in the preparatory world history class of the College. According to the Ministry of Education of Florida, this is the percentage of classes that were not compliant: * 2010-11 (Crest) 5.48 per cent * 2011-12 (Scott) 6.56 per cent * 2012-13 (Scott) 4.22 per cent * 2013-14 (Scott) 2.59 per cent. But then the numbers fell back. By December 2011, nearly half of the school districts in the state had violated the ceiling, including the provinces of Broward, Miami-Dade and Pasco. The provinces faced fines for violating the state. In Broward, more than half of the categories were non-compliant compared with a compliance rate of 97 per cent in the previous year. The Tampa Bay Times wrote that in Pasko, \"local, state and federal declining incomes prompted the Council to cancel several hundred teaching positions in order to balance the budget. The board and the board knew that this might mean that some layers would go beyond state limits. To get a fine for such a budget storm is \"too frustrating,\" a member of the Pasco Steve Luikart School Board said at the time. \"He's standing and whipping.\" Almost all the Miami-Dade classes complied with the size of the dismissal rule in 2011, but the region decided that it was cheaper to pay the penalty than to hire more staff to meet the ceiling. \"It didn't make economic sense at the time to comply 100 percent,\" said Antonio Cotarillo, the spokesperson for the region. According to State law, schools are to be compliant regardless of funding, and the amount of funding specifically directed towards class size has never decreased, according to a spokesman for the Florida Ministry of Education. This means that \"it is very difficult to establish a direct link between funding for lower and higher levels of total education,\" said Cheryl Etters, spokesman for the Ministry of Education. If the number of teachers across the state decreased by 1400 without being replaced, \"It's fair to assume that class sizes have increased,\" said Ruth Hasman Milton, Director of Government Relations of the Florida School Board Association. However, there are a number of factors affecting the size of groups, of which State budget cuts represent only one. Student registration is a key factor. The province may suddenly have an increase in the number of students due to immigration or immigration from other states. One of the provinces negotiating with the Teachers &apos; Union may have decided to increase pay as a trade-off for larger classes. \"There are many explanations why the county will struggle with the size of the row one year and not the following year,\" said Milton. \"It is never easy as a single sentence to explain almost anything with regard to financing education. There are always a number of factors affecting these things -- there is no single reason in one region or another that you can say, \"Oh, that's the element responsible for why things went wrong.\" We sent Christ's claim to a spokesman for Scott's campaign, who responded to claims promoting Scott's record of funding education after his first cycle. For example, Greg Blair referred to the \"registration\" of K-12 funding under Scott -- which is accurate in terms of the total amount but not per pupil. The Governor, Christ, said that Scott had reduced education by more than $1 billion, which meant that thousands of teachers \"lost their jobs\" and \"higher class sizes.\" The core of the truth in this allegation is that the number of teachers has already decreased and that the percentage of classes in terms of grade compliance increased in 2011. But this is beyond a long list of omissions - it does not reflect the full state of Scott. The first problem is that it obscures the fact that cutbacks occurred in 2011, followed by increases. In addition, it is exaggerated to say that \"thousands\" of teachers lost their jobs because of cuts in the State budget for 2011. State-wide data show that the number of teachers has decreased by some 1,405, but this includes departures for any reason, not just layoffs. The percentage of season sizes of compliance with the mandate rose by about one percentage point between Christ &apos; s last and Scott &apos; s first budgets. However, there are multiple factors in the provinces and states that affect the size of the layer, and compliance rules have changed repeatedly in recent years. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07268"}
