This measure, SJR 2, prohibits laws that compel people to purchase health insurance and has been a top priority for Senator Mike Hardopolous, who is running for the United States Senate. The Florida Senate voted earlier in the legislative session to put the amendment to the November 2012 ballot - assuming that any appeals to the Tribunal remain alive. Although the amendment is unlikely to overcome the impact of the Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the proposed change is seen as a straw poll on the popularity of the Health Care Act. The Democratic Republic of the Congo Joe Gibbons, D-Hallandale Beach, argued against the amendment, saying that it ran counter to the wishes of the majority of Florida. \"Voices show that Floridaans do not want to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\" said Gibbons shortly before the adoption of the amendment. We wanted to know how the people of Florida feel about the healthcare law. While there are dozens of polls on the popularity of the Federal Health Care Act at the national level, obtaining polling data at the state level is more difficult. The most recent poll in Florida comes from the University of Quebec, a non-partisan ballot group. From 29 March to 4 April, 1,499 registered voters were surveyed and two questions were raised about the Federal Health Care Act. When asked, \"Do you support Congress by repealing last year's Health Care Act,\" 49 per cent of respondents said yes and 41 per cent did not. When the question was formulated somewhat differently to call the law \"Health Care Reform Act,\" 54 percent said yes and 40 percent answered no. In another survey in Kuenyebek of 1,160 voters in January-31 January, 50 per cent of the residents of Florida said that the Health Care Act should be repealed; 43 per cent said that the Health Care Act should not be repealed. Recent polls show more positive views of the law now than previous surveys we have found, including in March 2010 by Mason Dixon. This survey found that 34 per cent of voters in Florida supported the law, while 54 per cent opposed it. At the national level, opinion polls requiring cancellation vary slightly. From April 7-12, 2011, the Kaiser Health Tracking Foundation found that 52 percent of Americans want to expand or retain the law as it is, 35 percent want to repeal the law and replace it with the GOP or completely abolish it, and 14 percent are uncertain. A survey of Fox News conducted on April 3-5 found that 60 percent of Americans wanted to abolish at least parts of the healthcare law, compared to 34 percent who wanted to expand it or leave it as it is. And the CBS referendum in January found that 48 percent of Americans want the bill to continue, 40 percent want to cancel it, and 12 percent say they're not sure. Therefore -- at least at the national level -- the results of the survey vary considerably. And sometimes, that's what makes the allegations about the polls so complicated. But in this case, we're processing Gibbons' claim specifically around Florida. He said: \"Voices show: Floridans do not want to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\" In a perfectly literal hearing of his comments, we think Gibbons is right -- some fluorescents don't want to cancel them. But actually, the question is, where does most of Florida stand? :: We found two celebrities from the University of Kuenyebek, both of whom found - albeit narrow - several Floridaans supporting the repeal of the Health Care Act. We're barely evaluating this claim. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021 Editor &apos; s Note: This statement was estimated to be barely correct when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name of the evaluation to most of the error.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13146"}
