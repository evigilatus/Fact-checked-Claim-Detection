Four seem relevant to this fact check. (The fifth deals with requiring approval of voters before a gambling establishment can be relocated.)\nIn 2006, Question 1 asked voters to authorize a resort casino in West Warwick. That proposal was defeated. In 2012, two questions -- one allowing casino games at Twin River, the other at Newport Grand -- were approved, although Newport voters rejected the Newport Grand proposal. In 2014, a new proposal to authorize casino gambling at Newport Grand was approved in a statewide vote, but lost again in Newport, where approval was also required for passage.\nWhen we checked the votes with the Rhode Island Board of Elections, we confirmed the tallies Doyle sent us and found a clear pattern. Here are the various approval rates:\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nR.I.\n\n\nTiverton\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\nQuestion 1: Gambling in West Warwick\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

Last year, the number of Tiverton voters approving table games at Newport was nearly 17 percent higher than the state as a whole.\nThe big question, of course, is whether Tiverton voters' degree of support will be as high if the gambling facility is going to be located in their town. Taylor's meeting Monday night with the Town Council didn't offer many clues, but the casino plans aren't going to be firmed up until November.\nBut if Twin River is looking to set up a facility in a community that is receptive to a casino, it looks like Tiverton is a good bet.\nWe rate Taylor's claim as True.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06440"}
