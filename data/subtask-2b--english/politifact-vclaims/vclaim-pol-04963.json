Pat Toomey, R-Pa., called it outrageous that Democratic nominee Katie McGinty tied him to GOP Presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. The two have wasted no time battling it out ever since McGinty won the Democratic primary April 26 to take on Toomey in the general election.\nAs a comeback, Toomey compared McGinty\u2019s campaign stances to those of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \"She actually agrees with Hillary Clinton and the most liberal wing of the Democrats on everything,\" said Toomey.\nWe reached out to Toomey\u2019s campaign for more background. \"The only times McGinty has publicly deviated from the Obama and Clinton agenda are when she's gone even further to the left, like embracing Bernie Sanders-style single-payer healthcare and defending sanctuary cities,\" Communications Director Ted Kwong said to PolitiFact PA in an email statement.\nMany observers would dispute aligning Clinton with party\u2019s most liberal faction. Nevertheless,\u00a0we looked\u00a0through issues backed by two candidates, and we found that Toomey\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t hold up entirely. Sure, there are plenty of things McGinty and Clinton agree on. Both cite a need for good-paying jobs and strengthening America\u2019s clean energy economy \u2014 just two examples out of many. But, we haven\u2019t found evidence to prove that Clinton and McGinty agree on each issue. Actually, we were able to find a couple on which their views don\u2019t align.\nOne of Clinton\u2019s big campaign issues is that \"climate change is an urgent threat,\" and she says we need to \"invest in clean energy innovations.\" McGinty has the same stance. However, when you look at fracking, McGinty\u2019s views set her apart from much of the party. Clinton\u2019s position has evolved some, but at present she believes fracking should only be permitted if the local residents approve. McGinty on the other hand thinks, with proper taxation and regulation, fracking should get the green light.\nThe two democratic nominees also have had very different histories with free trade. Clinton\u2019s position on NAFTA is complicated, to say the least. When Bill Clinton first signed the agreement into law in 1993, Hillary Clinton publicly supported it, but that support has waned over time. She most recently publicly backed NAFTA in her autobiography written in 2003 and in a teleconference that took place in 2004. Since that time, Clinton has not made public statements defending the free trade agreement. In fact, in 2008 Clinton called herself a \"critic of NAFTA from the very beginning.\" In reality, Clinton\u2019s public position on NAFTA has certainly shifted over the past few years. McGinty\u2019s stance on NAFTA has also evolved, but her present position is much less convoluted. In a democratic debate live from the University Park campus of Penn State last month, McGinty called NAFTA \"something that hasn\u2019t worked in 30 years.\"\nSo, it\u2019s not the case to say that the two candidates agree on everything. It would be more accurate to say they share the vast majority of issues that they\u2019ve endorse publicly. This is pretty common in Democratic races.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the lead-up to the primary, polling expert G. Terry Madonna told TribLive that McGinty differed little in stances from her fellow Democratic candidates, John Fetterman and Joe Sestak. \"This campaign is about personalities and style,\" Madonna said. \"On 100 issues in the Senate, these candidates would probably vote the same way on 98 of them. I don't think the issues are as defining as who these candidates are.\"\nRichardson Dilworth, director of the Center for Public Policy at Drexel University, argued that campaign stances aren\u2019t always directly representative of a candidate\u2019s personal beliefs, but of the campaign\u2019s stakeholders, of the constituencies the politician is aiming to attract. Looking beyond established platforms, two candidates can differ on more than their common planks would suggest.\n\"There\u2019s a distinction between [Clinton\u2019s] personal opinions and what she promises as a candidate. Those two things don\u2019t have to agree. There\u2019s no reason to expect that she\u2019s going to have the same personal opinions as she would have about positions she publicly takes because the positions she has to take as a candidate are going to be negotiations among many stakeholders,\" Dilworth said.\nDilworth thinks McGinty\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s strong similarities are no coincidence, though. \"Pennsylvania is, to a certain extent, representative of the country, more so than many other states,\" said Dilworth. \"In that respect, McGinty will be making a lot of the same pitches as Hillary Clinton because she\u2019s going for the same kinds of voters.\"\nOur ruling\nSenator Pat Toomey stated that Katie McGinty agrees with Hillary Clinton on everything. After closer inspection, it has become clear that although McGinty and Clinton share similar positions on many issues, there are a couple of significant instances where their opinions differ. Furthermore, many of their shared opinions can be attributed to the similarities in their intended audiences.\nMcGinty and Clinton have expressed similar public opinions on many issues, but it wouldn\u2019t be wholly accurate to say that they agree with each other on everything. We rate the claim Half True.\n\u00a0\nAn earlier version of this story characterized Katie McGinty's views on fracking as in line with Bernie Sanders. This is inaccurate. As the article describes, she is pro-fracking, provided\u00a0taxes and fair regulation are in place. Sanders is decidedly anti-fracking.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04963"}
