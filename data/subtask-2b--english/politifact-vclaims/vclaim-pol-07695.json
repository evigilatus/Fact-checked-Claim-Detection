In his piece, Obama claimed, \"The United States is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave.\"\nThat\u2019s quite the statement. But is it true?\nThe Family Medical Leave Act requires employers with 50 or more workers to allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn. While this means those individuals can take the time off without fear of losing their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid.\nThree states \u2014 California, New Jersey and Rhode Island \u2014 offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes. And some employers offer the perk even though it\u2019s not required. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 12 percent of private industry workers had access to some kind of paid family leave.\nHow does that compare to the rest of the world?\nWe asked the White House for the source of Obama\u2019s claim. They pointed us to a report by the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations.\nThe report looked at 170 countries where maternity benefit information was available. It found that only two don\u2019t provide some kind of cash benefit to women during maternity leave: Papua New Guinea and the United States.\nThat seems pretty convincing in its own right, but as the report notes, not all benefits are equal. Some countries cap the payments at low levels or exclude large portions of the population from eligibility.\nObama specified in his statement that he was comparing the United States to developed countries, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll focus on. For its part, the report labeled 41 countries and territories \"developed economies.\"\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that the United States provides the fewest benefits to the smallest percentage of its people. Of the developed countries, not only is it the only one that does not offer or require paid maternity leave, it is also mandates the shortest period of time off.\nThe United Kingdom and Australia provide the most time off, with both countries allowing a full year of leave, though not all of it is paid. At 13 weeks of maternity leave (all paid), Iceland has the second shortest leave, behind the U.S. at 12 weeks.\nThe International Labor Organization also categorizes each country by what percentage of the population actually receives cash benefits for maternity leave. Of the developed countries, the United States is in the bracket with the smallest percentages, with an estimated 10 to 32 percent of the population eligible for paid leave. No other developed country is below 33 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 41 developed countries, 17 provide paid time off for between 90 and 100 percent of their populations, including many Western European countries like Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K., but also Estonia and Czech Republic.\nBut some countries exclude certain portions of their populations from eligibility, making it far from a universal benefit. Temporary workers do not receive cash benefits in Canada, home workers don\u2019t receive maternity leave in Norway and Switzerland, and some civil servants don\u2019t get any in Japan. Canada also excludes migrant workers and individuals that own more than 40 percent of their business, and it requires women to have at least 600 hours of insurable employment to be eligible.\nThe result is that in some countries, large portions of the population don\u2019t end up actually being covered. In Spain and Japan, between 33 and 65 percent of workers are covered, the fewest other than the United States.\nThe International Labor Organization also sets a standard for what countries should provide in a benefits package: 1) women should receive at least 14 weeks off; 2) they should be reimbursed at least two-thirds of their previous earnings and 3) the benefit should be paid almost entirely by the state through public funds or social security.\nThe United States is the only developed country to meet none of the benchmarks (and one of just 14 studied worldwide). But six other countries fall short of at least one goal.\nCanada \u2014 Provides payments less than two-thirds of woman\u2019s previous earnings (55 percent)\nDenmark \u2014 Doesn\u2019t pay for benefit entirely through public funds (mix of public and employer contribution)\nGermany \u2014 Doesn\u2019t pay for benefit entirely through public funds (mix of public and employer contribution)\nIceland \u2014 Maternity leave is less than 14 weeks (13 weeks)\nMalta \u2014 Doesn\u2019t pay for benefit entirely through public funds (mix of public and employer contribution)\nSlovakia \u2014 Provides payments less than two-thirds of woman\u2019s previous earnings (65 percent i.e. very, very close)\nOur ruling\nObama said, \"The United States is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave.\" The United States does not mandate cash benefits for workers on maternity leave at the federal level, and just a small fraction of its citizens live in states that require it or work for companies that provide it. In that regard, the United States is very different than the rest of the developed world, where at least some paid benefits exist in every country.\nIt's worth noting, however, that paid maternity leave is far from a universal benefit in many developed countries. In some, as many as one-third of workers aren't actually covered for cash benefits, and six countries don't meet all of the International Labor Organizations guidelines for providing benefits.\u00a0\nWe rate Obama\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07695"}
