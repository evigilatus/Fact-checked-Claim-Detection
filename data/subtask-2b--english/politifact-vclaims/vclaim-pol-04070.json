At that point, Congress was starting to divide into two groups, said John Aldrich, a Duke University political science professor who wrote the book, \"Why Parties?: The Origin and Transformation of Political Parties in America.\"\nBut as a modern-looking continuous political party, it dates to either 1828, with the election of Andrew Jackson or 1832, when the party held its first national convention.\nRepublicans could trace their roots back to Washington\u2019s administration as well -- but the word \"continuous\" is key in this context.\n\"The Democrats have established their claim that they\u2019re the oldest continuous political party because the name changes less,\"Jillson said. \"The (two sides\u2019) agendas, though, go all the way back to the first Washington administration in the 1790s.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party can trace itself -- by three different names -- to Washington\u2019s first years, during which Alexander Hamilton was the Secretary of the Treasury and Thomas Jefferson was Secretary of State and they argued with each other in Washington\u2019s cabinet, Jillson said.\n\"The two parties grow out of that (those arguments) and so it\u2019s right to say that the Democrats are the oldest continuous party but the Republicans could make the claim that under three different names their party is just as old,\" he said.\nThe Federalists, originally associated with Hamilton\u2019s policies, became the Whigs, which became, ultimately, the Republicans, Jillson said.\nBut the line from Federalists to Republicans is more obscure, Aldrich said.\nMost would say that while there are some connections, the Whigs and the Republicans were really new parties, especially when compared to the more or less direct line between Jefferson and today\u2019s party, Aldrich wrote in an email.\nThe Republican Party says its founding came in the 1850s.\nThe Republican National Committee describes its formation at a meeting in Ripon, Wisconsin, in 1854 and the party\u2019s formal organization at a convention in Michigan that same year -- long after the Democrats. It held its first national convention in 1856.\nIn the whole world?\n\"In the U.S., we know the Democratic Party is older than the Republican Party and so the question is, is it older than other parties elsewhere in the world?\" said Casey Dominguez, an associate professor at the University of San Diego\u2019s Department of Political Science and International Relations.\nThere are only a handful of other democracies in the world to compare to, she said.\nOur experts primarily compared the U.S. political parties to those in Great Britain.\nAmerican political parties are recognized for their broad electorate that tends to line up behind the two major political parties, whereas that dynamic came much later in Britain, Jillson said. When political parties were developing in the United States, the British counterparts were more aggregations of elites.\nThe Conservative and Liberal parties in Britain can trace their roots to well before the founding of the United States. But it was not until the Great Reform Act of 1867 that Britain began to develop modern parties in the sense that a broader swath of the electorate was able to participate.\nOur rating\nKaine said that the Democratic Party is \"the oldest continuous political party in the world.\"\nThe political parties that developed in the United States were the first modern political parties in the sense that they drew broader representation from the general electorate than their predecessors in other nations.\nIn the U.S., the Democratic Party is older than the Republican Party.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f79891e0-294d-42ac-ac37-131d84a461b6", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04070"}
