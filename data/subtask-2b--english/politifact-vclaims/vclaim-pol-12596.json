In just part of a sentence \u2014 \"George\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes\" \u2014 we saw three issues worth a look.\n\n\u2022 Did\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0vote against most Republicans and with Democrats to create a Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action?\n\u2022 Was that task force proposal \"strikingly similar\" to the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, sometimes called the \"supercommittee,\" created by the Budget Control Act of 2011?\n\u2022 Is the\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0being \"set up ... to justify massive tax hikes\"?\n\nWe'll note that\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0did indeed\u00a0tweet unhappily\u00a0on Aug. 1, 2011, saying the, \"Debt deal offers no significant debt reduction & no fundamental reforms to solve DC's spending addiction\" and linking to a short post on his website that the debt deal was \"no time for celebration.\"\n\nDid\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0vote to create a Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action?\n\nLeMieux's\u00a0record of support for a bipartisan committee known as the \"Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action\" is clear. He was one of\u00a025 original co-sponsors\u00a0of legislation in 2009 by\u00a0Sens. Kent Conrad,\u00a0D-N.D., and Judd Gregg,\u00a0R-N.H., that would have created the task force. When it ultimately came up for a Senate vote as an amendment to an amendment to another bill in January 2010, the roll call at\u00a0Senate.gov\u00a0shows\u00a0he voted for it.\u00a0\n\nHis \"Yea\" vote put him with about 40 percent of Republicans. The majority of his party colleagues voted against it.\n\nThat supports\u00a0Hasner's\u00a0claim that he \"voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats\" to create the task force. But\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0wasn't exactly a \"token Republican vote for the Democrats,\" as\u00a0Hasner's\u00a0team put it. Fifteen of\u00a0LeMieux's\u00a0Republican colleagues joined him. The Democrats were as divided as the Republicans, though more of them supported the plan. Meanwhile, the final 53-46 Senate vote \u2014 seven votes short of the 60 required \u2014 understates earlier Republican support for the task force.\n\nSenate Minority leader Mitch McConnell had called it the \"best hope for addressing the out-of-control spending and debt levels that are threatening our nation's fiscal future.\" Then\u00a0antitax\u00a0activists attacked it\u00a0for leaving the door open to tax increases, and President Barack Obama endorsed it the Saturday before the vote. Seven Republican co-sponsors withdrew their support. McConnell also voted against it,\u00a0earning a Full Flop from\u00a0PolitiFact.\n\nWhich left\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0in his party's minority \u2014 but on a proposal with strong bipartisan roots.\n\nWas that task force proposal \"strikingly similar\" to the\u00a0supercommittee?\n\nHasner\u00a0accuses\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0of a flip-flop, saying he was \"for tax-raising committees before he was against them.\" But just how similar were the committees?\n\nIn some key ways, they're the same.\u00a0\n\nThe\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0is \"certainly a descendant of the task force and the many other similar type(s) of special mechanisms proposed to do the hard work Congress refuses to do,\" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. \"... This is not a new idea.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe committee proposals both include members appointed by Democrats and Republicans, seek ideas to reduce the \"fiscal imbalance of the federal government\" and require Congress to fast-track recommendations to a vote with no amendments.\n\nBut\u00a0LeMieux's\u00a0campaign points out a key difference: The 12-member\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0created by Congress requires just simple majority votes \u2014 for example, a single Republican could join six Democrats to endorse a plan. Meanwhile, the task force he supported required\u00a0supermajority\u00a0votes both by an 18-member committee and by Congress to implement its recommendations.\u00a0\n\n\"This would have protected taxpayers since the commission's plan would have needed the support of at least four of the eight Republicans on the commission to guarantee a vote in the House and Senate,\" said campaign manager Brian Seitchik. \"This would make it highly unlikely that the commission's plan would be able to get sufficient Republican support if it raised taxes.\"\n\nSo, are the committees \"strikingly similar\"? Yes, but arguably with enough room for\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0to explain why he might vote for one, but not support the other.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nTask Force for Responsible Fiscal Action\n\nJoint Committee on Deficit Reduction\n\n\n\nGoal\n\nTo provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly improve the long-term fiscal imbalance of the federal government, which may include expenditures and revenues\n\nTo reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion from 2012-21, providing recommendations and legislative language that will significantly improve the short-term and long-term fiscal imbalance of the federal government\n\n\n\nMembers\n\n18 (10 Democrats, 8 Republicans)\n\n12 (6 Democrats, 6 Republicans)\n\n\n\nTime before committee vote on recommendations\n\n41 weeks\n\n16 weeks\n\n\n\nNumber of members required for passage\n\n14 of 18 (78 percent)\n\n7 of 12 (58 percent)\n\n\n\nFast-tracking in House and Senate\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n\n\nAmendments allowed\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\n\n\nVotes required to pass Congress\n\nSupermajority\u00a0in each chamber\n\nSimple majority\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs the\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0being \"set up ... to justify massive tax hikes\"?\n\nNow we get to the crux of\u00a0Hasner's\u00a0campaign message, that\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0supported \"tax-raising\" committees before he opposed them.\n\nDid Congress create the\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0\"to justify massive tax hikes\"? And was raising taxes the purpose of the earlier task force that\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0supported?\n\nConsider this a matter of vociferous debate.\n\nNeither the task force nor the\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0proposals require tax increases. The earlier task force plan explicitly allowed for the possibility, saying that recommendations may include expenditures and revenues. Meanwhile, the supercommittee\u00a0legislation requires a $1.5 trillion reduction in the deficit but doesn't prescribe how to get there. Spending cuts? Tax increases? It's up to the committee, which doesn't have to be named until Aug. 16, 2011.\n\nIn fact, depending on whom you talk to, tax increases are guaranteed, likely \u2014 or, in the case of the\u00a0supercommittee, not even possible.\n\nHasner's\u00a0campaign cited a letter from\u00a0antitax\u00a0activist\u00a0Grover\u00a0Norquist, who opposed the earlier task force proposal. Norquist said that by relying on a committee that was not explicitly barred from raising taxes, tax hikes would occur.\n\n\"Every Democrat on the commission would insist on tax increases to 'balance' spending cuts in the recommendation. There is no conceivable scenario whereby the commission would issue a report that does not contain tax hikes,\" he wrote.\n\nGeorge F. Will\u00a0made a similar argument about the tax force proposal\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0supported: \"Substantively,\" he wrote, \"the task force would be a means of conscripting Republican participation in huge tax increases.\"\n\nEllis of Taxpayers for Common Sense disagrees with the premise that either committee was designed to justify tax increases.\n\n\"That's irresponsible fear-mongering, which is similar to those on the left saying the committee was established to slash Social Security or Medicare,\" Ellis said.\u00a0\n\nHe points out that only half the senators who voted against the task force proposal were Republicans.\n\n\"I don't think Sen. (Bernie) Sanders, I-Vt., was voting against the committee because he was afraid it would raise taxes,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0vote actually spawned days of debate about whether it would allow for tax increases at all, much less \"massive\" ones. (You can read some here:\u00a0Sort of,\u00a0Yes,\u00a0Maybe)\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner told his caucus it would\u00a0effectively be impossible\u00a0for the\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0to raise taxes. The White House disagreed.\n\nThe debate turned on a technical question: How would $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction be calculated?\n\nSome said\u00a0that, because the\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0legislation asks for estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, it would require using\u00a0CBO's\u00a0typical \"current law\" baseline \u2014 one that assumes the Bush tax cuts will expire in 2012 \u2014 as opposed to a \"current policy\" or \"plausible\" baseline that assumes that what's true now stays in place whether that requires an act of Congress or not. Others said the committee could request a different baseline.\n\nIf a current law baseline were required, Democrats wouldn't get any credit toward the $1.5 trillion for stopping or limiting the Bush tax cuts, for example, which would be presumed gone. Even if they wanted to do it anyway, increasing tax rates would get sticky.\u00a0\n\n\"The practical effect of this is that the bipartisan committee will be unable to make any recommendations regarding the Bush-era tax cuts,\" wrote Nick\u00a0Kasprak\u00a0of the business-backed Tax Foundation. \"For example, let's say the committee proposes, among other things, raising the top marginal tax rate 3 percentage points, from 35 percent to 38 percent, which would bring in some amount of revenue that counts towards their $1.5 trillion assignment. 'Hold on,' says the Congressional Budget Office, 'According to our current law baseline, that rate is set to go up to 39.6 percent in 2013 when the Bush-era tax cuts expire, so this is actually a tax cut, and it makes the deficit worse.' \"\n\nOne more\u00a0curveball: If the\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0deadlocks, or Congress doesn't pass what it recommends, the Budget Control Act includes an automatic trigger to cut $1.5 trillion across the board, split evenly between defense and everything else, and protecting just Social Security, Medicaid and veterans benefits. That's right:\u00a0No deal means just cuts.\n\nThe ruling\n\nHasner's\u00a0team said, \"George\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes.\"\n\nLeMieux\u00a0did vote against the majority of Republicans, joining with Democrats in an attempt to create a Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action \u2014 though the proposal had more bipartisan support than\u00a0Hasner's\u00a0full news release suggests. Meanwhile, while the task force would have been substantially similar to the\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0just established by Congress, it's different enough that\u00a0LeMieux\u00a0could explain his change of support without a change of heart. Finally, it's a serious stretch to say the\u00a0supercommittee\u00a0was designed \"to justify massive tax hikes.\" While tax increases are one plausible outcome, they aren't required, and depending on the baseline committee members choose, may not even be likely.
