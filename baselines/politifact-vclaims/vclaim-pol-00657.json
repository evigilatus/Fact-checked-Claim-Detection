Even though the Dems are totally in our way (they don\u2019t want money to go there) we\u2019re getting it done!\" Trump tweeted May 8.\nHours later at his Panama City Beach rally, Trump called on Democrats to work together with Republicans to pass disaster aid for the region affected by Hurricane Michael in 2018.\nTrump then talked about Democrats not wanting to build the wall on the U.S-Mexico border \u2014 a connection we\u2019ll explain later.\nTrump\u2019s comments that Democrats \"don\u2019t want\" money to go to the Panhandle oversimplified a partisan fight over hurricane relief dollars. Lawmakers in both parties support disaster aid, including for Florida, but the partisan battle has been over how much to give Puerto Rico.\nTrump\u2019s tweet echoes statements by U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who has also blamed Democrats for the lack of an agreement.\nPartisan fight over disaster aid\nTrump seems to be referring to failed efforts in the Senate to pass disaster aid.\nThe holdup has been in the Senate over how much money to give to Puerto Rico to recover from the 2017 hurricanes Irma and Maria. The negotiations have taken place amid Trump\u2019s criticism of politicians in Puerto Rico and his false claim that the island already got $91 billion.\nIn the House on Jan. 16, six Republicans joined the Democrats to pass HR 268, which included $14 billion for recovery from wildfires, hurricanes, and other recent natural disasters. The legislation included $600 million for Puerto Rico in disaster nutrition assistance.\nThat same day, the Trump administration wrote a letter calling the funding for Puerto Rico \"excessive and unnecessary.\" That prompted questions about whether Trump would sign a bill that included money for Puerto Rico.\nSenate Republicans wrote a few versions for disaster relief in 2019, including a $13.45 billion proposal in March by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala. He also included the $600 million in food assistance for Puerto Rico, calling it \"a key Democratic priority in the bill.\"\nBut on April 1, the Senate failed to move forward on two versions of disaster aid. The GOP version failed 44-49 with nearly all Democrats voting against it. The House Democratic version failed 46-48, with Republicans voting against it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Florida, the legislation would have delivered money for farmers who lost crops and expenses related to flood mitigation, disaster relief, long-term recovery, and restoration of infrastructure.\nSenate Appropriations Committee Vice Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the Democrats\u2019 version added up to $2.6 billion for Florida. That tally includes money for farmers, to rebuild roads and communities, and military projects. Exactly how much money would end up going to any state could change, however, depending on eligibility.\n\u00a0Pressure mounted to reach a new agreement, with weeks to go before the start of the June 1 hurricane season.\nOn May 10, the House is expected to vote on HR 2157, which would provide $17 billion in aid, but the chances of a resolution in the Senate remain murky.\nNews reports in early May said senators were close to a $17 billion deal that includes speeding up access to money for Puerto Rico and money for the Midwest for flooding in 2019. However, the Washington Post reported about a new wrinkle: the Trump administration wanted to add $4.5 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border. Lawmakers from both parties resisted that idea.\nDisaster aid was a subject of a luncheon with the GOP senators and Vice President Mike Pence. Shelby told the Washington Post that both parties want disaster aid.\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Democrats clearly want disaster assistance to go to Florida.\n\"Considering the President has consistently and incorrectly complained about how much assistance has been given to Puerto Rico, I would say most of the blame goes to him. I believe Senate Republicans are tired of this fight, and with both Florida Senate seats in Republican hands,they want this done,\" he said, referring to Marco Rubio and Scott. \"If he gave his blessing, I think the disaster supplemental would move through Congress like greased lightning.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said Democrats \"don\u2019t want money\" to go to the Florida Panhandle for Hurricane Michael aid.\nHis swipe appears to a reference to the Senate Democrats\u2019 April 1 vote against a GOP version of disaster aid, because Democrats wanted more money for Puerto Rico. But Trump omits that Senate Democrats voted in favor of their own version that included money for Florida and other areas hit by disasters. Also, the Democratic-led House passed a bill months ago.\nTrump also omits his own role in the delays, including his critical comments about Puerto Rico and his recent request to add money for the border wall.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1f9ef6e3-1308-4603-8662-6227eb4e218d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00657"}
