That\u2019s what is happening with a viral post that alleges the great abolitionist Harriet Tubman said she believed she could have freed more slaves if only they \"knew\" they were slaves.\nA post recently shared to Facebook features an image of Tubman alongside the quote, which says: \"I freed a thousand slaves. I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWhile the quote has been debunked as fake before, it continues to get re-posted on social media.\nThere is no evidence that Tubman said this, and while she has been credited with liberating hundreds of slaves (not thousands) on the Underground Railroad in the past, historians now say the number of people she personally guided to freedom is closer to 70 or 80.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKate Clifford Larson is a historian and Tubman scholar who authored the biography, \"Bound For the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero.\" Larson told PolitiFact Tubman never made that statement.\n\"Tubman never said this. I think the phrase started making the rounds back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It is ridiculous in the extreme. Of course enslaved people knew they were enslaved. All of them wanted to be free,\" Larson wrote in an email. She said Tubman herself rescued about 70 people on the Underground Railroad and, with the help of about 150 black soldiers helped liberate 750 enslaved people from plantations on the Combahee River in South Carolina during a raid in June 1863.\nA spring 2008 article in the Maxwell Perspective, a magazine of the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, traced some of the confusion to feminist political analyst Robin Morgan. During the 2008 presidential primary matchup between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, Morgan wrote a follow-up to her\u00a0famous 1970 essay \"Goodbye to All That.\"\nChallenging\u00a0women who didn\u2019t support Clinton, Morgan wrote, \"Let a statement by the magnificent Harriet Tubman stand as reply. When asked how she managed to save hundreds of enslaved African Americans via the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, she replied bitterly, \u2018I could have saved thousands\u2014if only I\u2019d been able to convince them they were slaves.\u2019\"\nThe Maxwell Perspective also found the quote to be inauthentic, and several scholars who studied Tubman were unable to locate a primary source for the statement.\nThis faux quote is Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-04-03 14:20:29 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Quotes Harriet Tubman as saying \"I freed a thousand slaves.
