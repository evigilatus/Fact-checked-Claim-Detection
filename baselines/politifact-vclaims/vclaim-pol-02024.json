Kay Ivey's grant funding to LGBTQ nonprofit", "text": "Scott Dawson, an evangelical minister running for governor in Alabama, accused the incumbent of funnelling taxpayer dollars to a controversial cause.\n\"It's been uncovered that Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers\u2019 money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism,\" Dawson\u2019s campaign wrote in a press release.\nThe organization in question is Free2Be, a non-profit that provides counseling services to LGBTQ victims of domestic violence and bullying in Alabama.\nThe nonprofit has been the subject of heavy scrutiny in Alabama, but for financial reasons, not political ones.\nAfter the group\u2019s founder, James Robinson, left the group in January, the board of directors determined that Free2Be did not have the financial stability to continue. The group shuttered its doors after a state agency found they had failed to pay payroll taxes to the IRS.\nDawson\u2019s campaign pointed us to a 2012 YouTube video as evidence Free2be is a \"liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism.\"\nThe video didn\u2019t suggest the organization aimed to change anyone\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. Neither do the group\u2019s public statements. Instead, Robinson railed against messages of hate from teachers, parents and churches towards LGBTQ teens.\nFederal grants\nSo what taxpayer funding did the group receive until they landed in hot water?\nDawson\u2019s campaign overshot the target by a few hundred thousand dollars with their $1 million figure.\nThe campaign calculated that Free2Be received $762,042.37 in federal grants since Ivey assumed office in April 2017, using data from Alabama\u2019s Finance Department.\nBut the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, which reviews grant applications and presents funding recommendations to the governor\u2019s office for approval, announces grants on an annual basis. Ivey\u2019s administration was responsible for approving $800,000 in grants for fiscal year 2018, which began in October 2017.\nOf that total, $727,410 came from the Victims of Crime Act, which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice, and $49,915 from the federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.\nThe grants refunded expenses incurred by the organization. Those payments stopped in late March, when Free2Be shut down, and added up to $422,680.37.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fiscal year 2018, the state awarded $23.5 million in Victims of Crime Act grants to 79 nonprofit or governmental agencies across Alabama, said Department of Economic and Community Affairs spokesman Josh Carples. Free2Be was one of those recipients.\nThe law requires that 10 percent of Victims of Crime Act grant funding go to underserved victims of violent crime each year. The agency started to look for LGBTQ grant recipients in 2013, after a program specialist noticed the agency was not funding any providers that serviced that community. Because it qualified as underserved, the specialist suggested the agency begin LGBTQ outreach.\nThe following year, Free2Be was the only Victims of Crime Act applicant serving the LGBTQ population, and the agency approved their grant request.\nTaxpayer dollars\nIvey\u2019s campaign argued that the grants were not funded by taxpayer dollars, but by federal criminal fees.\nThe Office for Victims of Crime\u2019s website uses a similar distinction as Ivey in describing these grants: \"The Fund is financed by fines and penalties paid by convicted federal offenders, not from tax dollars.\"\nBut Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said there is a distinction between tax dollars and taxpayer dollars.\n\"User fees are, technically, not \u2018tax dollars\u2019 in that they are not the product of our tax system,\" Gardner said. \"But the broader claim that these are not \u2018taxpayer dollars\u2019 doesn't seem right. When we pay the $20 entrance fee to visit a national park, we're not paying a tax. But most people would say that $20 is \u2018taxpayer dollars\u2019 in that the government collected it from people, and will spend it on some public services.\"\nGardner likened a $20 park fee to the fines and penalties paid by federal offenders.\nSusan Pace Hamill, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, agreed.\n\"Criminal fines and forfeitures are not typical taxes, but resemble typical taxes because they represent dollars collected involuntarily and are used for some public purpose,\" Hamill said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nDawson said, \"It's been uncovered that Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers\u2019 money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism.\"\nThe organization in question is Free2Be, a victims resources nonprofit that serviced the LGBTQ community. Dawson distorted the organization\u2019s purpose, which was to support LGBTQ victims of domestic violence and bullying in Alabama, not to change anyone\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation.\nThe Ivey administration approved almost $800,000 in grants to Free2Be in order to meet a federal grant quota for underserved communities. But the group did not receive the full amount before it closed in March; it received a little more than half of that funding.\nThe statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
