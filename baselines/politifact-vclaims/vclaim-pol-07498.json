Scott Walker drew criticism in conservative circles when his campaign TV ads portrayed Democratic rival Mary Burke as an outsourcing profiteer at Trek Bicycle Corp.\nWalker was asked if the strategy was hypocritical, given that he criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s relentless attacks on 2012 GOP presidential rival Mitt Romney as a greedy outsourcer in his private equity days at Bain Capital.\n\"Fundamentally different,\" Walker was quoted as saying in the July 24, 2014 Wisconsin State Journal.\nWalker argued that, \"Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him. If he had, then I think it would be fair game to say then you need to look at all of his experience.\"\nLet\u2019s hit the rewind button.\nIs Walker right that Romney \"did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him\"?\nPresidential politics, circa 2012\nTo back up the claim, Alleigh Marr\u00e9, a Walker campaign spokeswoman, sent us 11 video examples of Romney criticizing Obama and his record, as well as touting his own plans.\n\"The contrast Governor Walker was making between Burke and Romney in the statement you provided is that Romney was running a more robust and dynamic campaign that did not focus solely, or even primarily, on his business experience like Burke\u2019s does,\" Marr\u00e9 wrote in an email.\nBut Walker did not couch his remark that way; he said Romney didn\u2019t offer his business experience even as \"a\" reason to support him.\nThat\u2019s a rewrite of history.\nRomney may have downplayed his tenure as Massachusetts governor.\nBut from start to finish in the campaign, he hammered home his private-sector time, as did campaign surrogates including key Republican officials.\nA few examples:\nApril 2011: Just 45 seconds into his announcement video, Romney ran through his 25-years-long private-sector resum\u00e9 and emphasized how it could help him solve America\u2019s economic woes: \"I learned how America competes with companies in other countries, why jobs leave and how jobs are created at home.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 2011: \"I spent my life in the private sector, not in government,\" Romney said in Orlando during a GOP primary debate. \"I only spent four years as a governor. I didn\u2019t inhale. I\u2019m a business guy.\"\nAugust 23, 2012: Responding to Obama attacks, Romney defended and embraced the lessons of his private-sector years, writing in the Wall Street Journal:\n\"The lessons I learned over my 15 years at Bain Capital were valuable in helping me turn around the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. They also helped me as governor of Massachusetts to turn a budget deficit into a surplus and reduce our unemployment rate to 4.7%. The lessons from that time would help me as president to fix our economy, create jobs and get things done in Washington.\"\nAugust 30, 2012: At the Republican convention, Romney repeatedly used his acceptance speech to talk about the fundamental divide between he and Obama.\n\"He took office without the basic qualification that most Americans have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business,\" Romney said. \"Jobs to him are about government. I learned the real lessons about how America works from experience.\"\nOctober 2012: In the second presidential debate, Romney cited his real-world work experience to bolster his credibility on tackling complex problems: \"I want to make small businesses grow and thrive. I know how to make that happen. I spent my life in the private sector. I know why jobs come and why they go.\"\nAnd that list is just after a cursory review.\nFinally, we offer one more quote from the 2012 campaign trail:\n\"We know that Mitt Romney had an incredible career in the private sector, turning businesses around that otherwise would have failed, and thousands of people owe their jobs to that today.\"\nThat was from an introduction of Romney at a Nov. 2, 2012 campaign rally in West Allis.\nThe speaker: Scott Walker.\nOur rating\nWalker said that \"Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him.\"\nTo the contrary, Romney made frequent and high-profile use of his extensive private-sector credentials, making them the core of his deep and sustained criticism of Obama\u2019s record on handling the economy.\nNobody would know that better than Walker, who helped remind voters of nominee\u2019s business-world record.\nThe claim is inaccurate and ridiculous.\nPants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07498"}
