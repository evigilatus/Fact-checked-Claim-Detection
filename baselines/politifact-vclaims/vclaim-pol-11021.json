Rep. Joseph McNamara says 25 percent of Rhode Island\u2019s physicians graduated from for-profit medical schools", "text": "State Rep. Joseph M. McNamara has been out front supporting a virtually unheard of idea in America: a for-profit medical school.\n\nMcNamara, a Warwick Democrat \u00a0who chairs the House Health, Education and Welfare Committee, is pushing a bill that would place a \u00a0\"Rhode Island School of Osteopathic Medicine\" on the same local stage now dominated by Brown University\u2019s nonprofit Warren Alpert Medical School.\n\nIn advocating for the school, McNamara took to the House floor recently.\n\nResponding to insinuations from a Brown dean that for-profit schools produced less competent doctors, McNamara told fellow legislators \"in the state of Rhode Island 25 percent of our current physicians are graduates of for-profit medical schools.\" And, McNamara said, no one\u2019s suggesting they\u2019re any less qualified than doctors from nonprofit schools.\n\nWe\u2019re aware of the growing number of for-profit colleges and universities around the country, particularly on the web. But for-profit medical schools are much rarer. We wondered whether so many of Rhode Island\u2019s doctors could be graduates of such schools.\n\nSo we called McNamara and asked where he got his 25 percent figure. McNamara said it was cited in a letter he received from Steven C. Rodger, \u00a0the principal proponent of the for-profit medical school.\n\nRodger is president and CEO of R3 Education, a Massachusetts-based holding company that runs three for-profit medical schools in the Caribbean offering MD degrees. Rodger had earlier told McNamara\u2019s committee that the new Rhode Island school would help ease the state\u2019s shortage of primary care physicians, create up to 300 new jobs and generate more tax revenue, while charging significantly lower tuition than other medical schools.\n\nWhen McNamara faxed us Rodger\u2019s letter, we immediately saw a couple of problems with his statement. The most obvious: the letter doesn\u2019t say what McNamara said on the House floor, that 25 percent of Rhode Island\u2019s doctors graduated from for-profit schools.\n\nInstead, it says Rhode Island has \"over 25 percent of its active physicians workforce comprised of IMG\u2019s,\" an acronym for international medical graduates. In other words: more than a quarter of Rhode Island\u2019s doctors, according to the letter, graduated from international medical schools. That doesn\u2019t mean they are all for-profit schools.\n\nWe called Rodger to find out where his figure came from. He pointed us to the 2011 State Physician Workforce Data Book, \u00a0published by the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nThat report includes a table (actually prepared by the American Medical Association) showing that 908 of Rhode Island\u2019s 3,513 active physicians in 2010 graduated from international medical schools, or 25.8 percent.\n\nThat places Rhode Island 11th in the country in terms of the percentage of doctors who graduated from international medical schools.\n\nBut again that doesn\u2019t get to McNamara\u2019s statement that a quarter of the state\u2019s doctors graduated from for-profit medical schools.\n\nThe United States has only one for-profit medical school, according to several sources:Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine, in Parker, Colo., which opened in 2008.\n\nThere are more than 2,246 medical schools around the world (including 137 accredited U.S. schools), according to the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research. That\u2019s a nonprofit group associated with the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, a private Philadelphia organization that certifies the readiness of international medical students into U.S. graduate programs.\n\nRodger said he believes that most international medical schools, such as the three his company runs, are for-profit ventures, but he didn\u2019t have any hard facts. His letter to McNamara made the same general statement without any attribution.\n\nPolitiFact Rhode Island tried to verify if that was true by checking with the Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Medical Association, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine and finally the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates.\n\nNone could say how many international medical schools were for-profit.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcNamara concedes he misspoke on the House floor. He said \"25 percent of our current physicians are graduates of for-profit medical schools.\" He meant to say that a quarter of Rhode Island\u2019s doctors graduated from international medical schools.\n\nMcNamara says he was relying on information Rodger presented: \"We [legislators] assume that people give us information that is accurate.\" But Rodger did provide accurate information -- as far as it went -- McNamara just cited it inaccurately.\n\nWe rule his statement False.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.
