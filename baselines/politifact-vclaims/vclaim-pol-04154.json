The topic: the deaths of four Americans in a 2012 attack on a U.S. complex in Benghazi, Libya.\n\"Here's an interesting one: Sidney Blumenthal,\" Trump said to boos, referring to a longtime confidant of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Trump, speaking in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Oct. 10, continued (at about the 44-minute\u00a0mark.):\n\"Do you remember when Ambassador (Chris) Stevens in Benghazi was calling, and writing -- they were desperate for help. They say like 600 times, right? The only one she was speaking to is Sidney Blumenthal,\u00a0who's a sleaze. He's a sleaze. In fact, Obama wanted her restricted (so) that she couldn't speak (to him). That's probably one of the reasons she wanted to have her private server, you know? Because she promised Obama that she wouldn't be talking to sleazy Sidney.\n\"So, Blumenthal writes a quote -- this just came out a little while ago. I have to tell you this. (Trump reads from paper.) \u2018One important point has been universally acknowledged by the nine previous reports about Benghazi\u2019 -- this is Sidney Blumenthal, the only one she was talking to. ...\n\" \u2018The attack was almost certainly preventable\u2019 -- Benghazi. \u2018Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect the United States personnel and an American consulate in Libya\u2019 -- he meant Benghazi. \u2018If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate.\u2019\n\"In other words, he is now admitting that they could have done something about Benghazi. This just came out a little while ago.\"\nThere\u2019s a problem with what Trump said: Blumenthal didn\u2019t write those words.\nFollowing the rally in Wilkes-Barre, Kurt Eichenwald, a Newsweek reporter, wrote an article in which he noted that he had written those words himself.\n\"Those words sounded really, really familiar,\" Eichenwald wrote. \"Really familiar. Like, so familiar they struck me as something I wrote. Because they were something I wrote.\" Specifically, an article\u00a0he wrote from Oct. 21, 2015, titled, \"Benghazi Biopsy: A Comprehensive Guide to One of America's Worst Political Outrages.\"\nIn general, the article criticized Republicans for politicizing Benghazi. It concludes in part:\n\"In the end, one thing is clear: This rabid partisanship or unmitigated deception or utter incompetence conflicts with everything this country stands for. Four men died serving their country; it is beyond disgraceful that their memories are used for cartoons and political buttons and television shows all for the purpose of advancing outright falsehoods just to gain political points. In their refusal to read documents or accept facts over fantasies, Republican conspiracy theorists have damaged this country in ways that cannot yet be fully comprehended.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, elsewhere in the article, Eichenwald listed some areas of inquiry that he considered valid for investigation, and that were in line with investigations done after previous deadly attacks:\n\"One important point has been universally acknowledged by the nine previous reports about Benghazi: The attack was almost certainly preventable. Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect U.S. personnel at an American consulate in Libya. If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate.\"\nThe important thing to note here is that Eichenwald, a journalist, wrote those words, not Blumenthal. So how did Blumenthal get wrapped up in this?\nAs it turns out, one of the emails leaked by Wikileaks was sent by Blumenthal to Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. The email in question was sent on the same day the Newsweek article came out; it was addressed to \"undisclosed recipients.\"\nIn the email, Blumenthal forwarded Eichenwald\u2019s article, with the header, \"Key Section. Then whole article below.\" It includes both a link to the article and some text from it, including Eichenwald\u2019s byline. Here's a screenshot:\n\n\nHow Eichenwald\u2019s words and Blumenthal\u2019s became conflated is open to debate. Eichenwald pointed to Sputnik, a Russian website, which wrote an article that indicated that the words were Blumenthal\u2019s. (The original Sputnik article has since been pulled from the Web.) Other observers, including BuzzFeed News\u2019 Jon Passantino, have pointed to a viral tweet as the source instead.\nEither way, what is not in doubt is\u00a0the inaccuracy of Trump\u2019s comment. At most, one could say that Blumenthal had forwarded an article, without added commentary, to Podesta. But that doesn\u2019t make those words Blumenthal\u2019s, and it does not mean that this is a case of Blumenthal \"admitting that they could have done something about Benghazi,\" as Trump said. It\u2019s much more plausible that Blumenthal, a Clinton loyalist, was forwarding the article to Podesta because of its overall, forcefully worded argument that the Republicans had turned Benghazi into a political football, not because of a couple cautionary\u00a0sentences out of a 10,000-word article.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check..\nOur ruling\nTrump said that Blumenthal wrote that the Benghazi attack \"was almost certainly preventable. Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect U.S. personnel and an American consulate in Libya.\"\nBut Blumenthal didn\u2019t write those words; Eichenwald did.
