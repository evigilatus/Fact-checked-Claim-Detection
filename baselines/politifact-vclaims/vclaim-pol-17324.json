The video still shows a picture of Vanessa Bryant and says \"R.I.P. Vanessa Bryant 1982-2020.\" The BBC News logo is in the corner.\u00a0\nBut searching the BBC\u2019s website, we found no coverage of Vanessa Bryant\u2019s supposed suicide. Other news organizations likewise didn\u2019t report on her death.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Aaron\u2019s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y.

More astute news consumers, however, have followed credible news stories about Koby Bryant\u2019s death. And more than 10 million liked this photo that Vanessa Bryant posted of her family on Instagram last week when she thanked the \"millions of people who\u2019ve shown support and love during this horrific time.\"\u00a0\n\"I\u2019m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it\u2019s impossible to imagine life without them,\" she said. \"But we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way.\"\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17324"}
