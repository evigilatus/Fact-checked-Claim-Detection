The letter then invites people to read a message from the Self-Employment Defense Centre. \"By guarding the glowing lights in favour of compressed fluorescent lights, environmentalists have said that the country will reduce energy consumption by $18 billion a year, or will provide consumers from $80 to $180 on their electricity bills a year.\" \"Additional to the worlds? They said it would reduce global warming because one of the reasons for global warming is... you figured it out. The letter requests contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Law on the Better Use of Light Rods, sponsored by Sin. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to eliminate the standards of light bulb efficiency contained in the Energy Independence and Security Act 2007. \"Help put an end to government interference in our lives! Help put an end to Mr. Obama's interference with the free enterprise!\" The letter urges, with reference to President Barack Obama. We're investigating several allegations from these LEDs, and in this letter, we're going to address the central allegation that \"Democrats have already voted to ban traditional LEDs (used by you and me to date) For dangerous fluorescent lamps.\" First of all, it is not accurate to stick the law entirely to Democrats. It is true that more Democrats than Republicans voted in favour of the Energy Independence and Security Act 2007. But he's got some party support. The Council passed by 264-163 votes (with 36 Republicans voting in favour). In the Senate, the vote was 65-27 (with 20 votes in favour of the Republicans). It was signed by President George W. Bush of the Republic. We are also exploring whether fluorescent lamps release \"dangerous\" amounts of mercury into the environment in a separate factual verification process. But the biggest issue here is the claim that the bill prohibits glowing lamps. (sik) 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act 2007 provides for new standards, which essentially require that lamps be 25 per cent more efficient than they are now. In particular, a 100 watt light bulb will be replaced by an electric lamp that uses no more than 72 watts of electricity while still providing a comparable light output. The 75 watt, 60 and 40 watt lamps must be replaced by lamps with no more than 53, 43 and 29 watts, respectively. The Act gradually introduced new requirements: the first was the replacement of 100 watt lamps by 1 January 2012, followed by light bulbs below watts in subsequent years. The compressed fluorescent lamps and compressed light bulbs easily meet the new efficiency criteria. But we didn't find any language in the law specifically banning glowing lamps. So we asked Ron Arnold from the Self-Employment Defense Center to support the claim that the Law \"External Laws\" is a glowing lamp. Arnold said that the bill was full of vague and confusing language and that there was an actual ban because the criteria were so strict that no factory would be able to build the glowing lamps it met. \"We believe \"pan\" is an exact term because there's nothing like what they need,\" said Arnold. \"If it's available, where can I buy it?\" He asked. \"Why isn't the warehouse carrying them?\" In fact, they say, Randy Morehead, Vice-President of Government Affairs at Phillips Electronics, one of three major manufacturers of lightbulbs in the new EcoVantage lamp in the United States, Philips also offers an excellent lamp that costs more, but it lasts three times longer. Both lamps are more expensive than the current 100 watt glowing lamps, but more than they pay themselves for electricity to run them (more in another fact check). The other two major players in this industry, Osram Silvania and J.J., have developed new Helogenic Tohini lamps that meet new efficiency standards. But for these, you have to go to Louis. Morehead said that industry representatives were closely involved in the legislative process to develop new efficiency standards and would never support the ban on glowing lamps. Companies, as well as legislators who had drafted the bill, were well aware that new standards could be met through the development of halogen flare lamps. \"You don't have to buy fluorescent lamps,\" said Stephen Waddle, Executive Director of the American Council for Energy Efficiency. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for security, saying \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, Jane Stotsman, spokesman for the Department of Energy, said that allegations about banning glowing lamps were simply false. \"She doesn't ban a particular kind of lamp,\" she said. This is a clear call for us. It is true that the current versions of glowing lamps will be phased out. The compressed fluorescent lamps and LED lamps offer more efficient alternatives, but if the glowing light is your thing, It has developed and shipped hydrogen flares that meet new efficiency standards, so there is no basis for claiming that they are banned for fluorescent lamps. We're ruling this claim with pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13069"}
