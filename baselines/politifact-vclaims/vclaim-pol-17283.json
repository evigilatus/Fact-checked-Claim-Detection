When the ballots were added to the state total about 3:30 a.m. Nov. 4, Wisconsin swung from a lead for President Donald Trump to a lead for former Vice President Joe Biden. A later canvass and recount confirmed Biden won the state by about 21,000 votes.\nBut the swing and timing sparked an avalanche of misinformation, with Trump and an array of other Republicans claiming there was something nefarious about the late arrival of Milwaukee\u2019s votes. Of course that\u2019s ridiculous: We\u2019ve noted in multiple False and Pants on Fire ratings that the absentee votes from Milwaukee, a Democratic stronghold, were long expected to heavily favor Biden and to come in late.\nThe controversy stems from limitations in state law on when election workers can process absentee votes \u2014 limitations that were unchanged despite the massive increase in this kind of voting amid the pandemic.\nState Sen. Tim Carpenter, D-Milwaukee, raised this point in a letter to the state\u2019s Republican legislative leaders, seeking a bipartisan task force to improve Wisconsin\u2019s voting system.\n\"Wisconsin is one of the few states that doesn\u2019t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day,\" Carpenter said in the Dec. 11, 2020, news release.\n\"Allowing this simple change would stop the false accusation that tens of thousands of ballots are secretly being dumped after midnight changing the outcome of the election. We all know our current process and know that is not true. It is just a matter our laws requiring workers to wait until 7:00 AM on Election Day to begin tabulating.\"\nIs Carpenter right that Wisconsin law handcuffs election officials in a way most states don\u2019t?\nMost states begin process sooner\nThe short answer is yes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe longer answer depends a bit on how you define processing.\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures compiled details on how each state handled absentee ballots for the 2020 election.\nTheir research showed many states limit counting of absentee votes to Election Day \u2014 about 30 in all.\nBut few go as far as Wisconsin in not allowing any ballot processing until that day. Only Alabama, Indiana, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wyoming require that ballots not be processed until Election Day. (Michigan requires smaller cities to wait until Election Day, while those with 25,000 or more people can start a day early.)\nThe timelines vary among the other states, with some allowing ballots to be processed as soon as they are received, while others begin the process a set amount of time before Election Day.\nA New York Times breakdown of when states are allowed to begin \"pre-processing\" ballots \u2014 defined as verifying signatures, opening envelopes and flattening ballots to get them ready for tabulation \u2014 shortened that list further, showing only Alabama, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin limiting this to Election Day.\nWe saw dramatically different vote reporting dynamics in states that allow this earlier ballot processing. In North Carolina, for example, where absentee votes can be processed five weeks before the election and counted two weeks before, an early lead for Biden turned into a Trump win as in-person votes were added to the tallies later in the day.\nOur ruling\nCarpenter said Wisconsin is one of the few states that don\u2019t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day.\nHowever we define that processing, it\u2019s clear Wisconsin in the extreme minority. Just a handful of states ban election workers from beginning work on absentee ballots before Election Day.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17283"}
