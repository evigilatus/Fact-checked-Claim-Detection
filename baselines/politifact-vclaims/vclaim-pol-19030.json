Thom Tillis claims that his Democratic opponent is out of touch with most North Carolinians.\nAnd he saved one of his more memorable accusations against Cal Cunningham for his closing statement in the Sept. 14 debate on WRAL.\n\"Cal criticizes tax breaks for the wealthy, but when Cal was making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, he got a $40,000 tax incentive to update his butler\u2019s pantry,\" Tillis said in his closing statement. (Around the 58-minute mark of this video).\n\"I didn\u2019t know what a butler\u2019s pantry was because we didn\u2019t have them in the trailer parks I grew up in,\" he said. \"But really, he may have qualified for it but used that. Cal will say anything to get elected.\"\nRepublicans have used various forms of this claim to attack Cunningham, citing a story by Real Clear Politics.\u00a0\nTillis offered a similar line during the Sept. 22 debate on CBS 17, saying: \"When (Cunningham) was making almost $300,000 a year, he got a tax credit from the state of North Carolina, $40,000, to renovate his house including a butler\u2019s pantry,\" he said around the 26-minute mark of this video.\nThe Tillis campaign went a step further in a recent press release, accusing Cunningham of \"abusing\" the tax credit. Meanwhile, the National Republican Senatorial Committee\u2019s video ad claimed that Cunningham got a tax break for not only a butler\u2019s pantry, but also a wet bar.\n(If these attacks sound familiar, that may be because Tillis\u2019 fellow Republican North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr questioned his opponent\u2019s use of the same tax credits back in 2016.)\nSo what\u2019s the truth about Cunningham\u2019s use of the tax credit and his home renovation?\n\n\nCunningham did receive a $38,000 tax credit for renovations to his house, which is considered a historic property.\n\n\nA butler\u2019s pantry was one part of several renovations.\n\n\nThe \"butler\u2019s pantry\" and \"wet bar\" were two terms used by an inspector to describe the same area in Cunningham\u2019s kitchen. They are not two separate areas.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Cunningham has done anything illegal.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, Cunningham says he doesn\u2019t have a butler.\nTax credits for renovations\n\u00a0\nNorth Carolina offers tax credits to people who restore historic homes.\u00a0\nAccording to state law, the owner must spend at least $25,000 on renovations to qualify for a tax credit. The owner must also \"provide a copy of the certification obtained from the State Historic Preservation Officer verifying that the historic structure has been rehabilitated in accordance\" with state law.\nCunningham owns a historic home in Raleigh and he applied for the credits in 2014. We reached out to the state\u2019s Historic Preservation Office about Cunningham\u2019s renovations. Officials said they\u2019re not allowed to speak about individual taxpayers.\u00a0\nHowever, they directed us to state records showing who has received tax credits for historic home restorations. PolitiFact also obtained Cunningham\u2019s application.\nRecords from 2015 show Cunningham spent $129,536 on renovations to his home. Records show he then received $38,860 in tax credits, which were granted to him in installments of $7,772 over the course of five years (as required by law).\nCunningham\u2019s application includes notes from an inspector, revealing each part of the house under consideration for renovations. It shows he sought to:\n\n\nAdd a roof over the basement doorway\n\n\nAdd stained glass windows to bathrooms\n\n\nReplace hardwood floors,\n\n\nRemove walls on the first floor, as well as one in the upstairs bathroom.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelocate a sink,\n\n\nRepair a retaining wall outside,\n\n\nAnd renovate part of the kitchen.\n\n\nThe \"butler\u2019s pantry\" is one of several renovation ideas mentioned in the inspector's notes about the kitchen.\n\"The kitchen seems to be in two distinct pieces, much (of) which is in what was probably the original kitchen,\" the inspector wrote. \"The secondary cooking area and eating bar are in the space that was probably originally the breakfast room. Several of the appliances are non functional and need replacing.\"\nThe inspector said this about Cunningham\u2019s plans to update the kitchen:\n\"Modifications hope to consolidate the main kitchen elements back into the original space and render the cooking extension into more (of) a wet bar/butler\u2019s pantry area. The stove that does work will replace the cooktop and wall oven in the primary kitchen space. Dishwasher will be replaced with new venting to be determined.\"\nThat\u2019s all the application says about the \"butler\u2019s pantry\" area.\nWhat is a butler\u2019s pantry?\nSo what, exactly, is a butler\u2019s pantry?\n\"A butler\u2019s pantry is pretty common. Basically an extra kitchen prep space,\" Michele Walker, spokeswoman for the state\u2019s Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.\nRealtor.com, a website created by the National Association of Realtors, wrote in 2019 that a butler\u2019s pantry isn\u2019t as fancy as it sounds.\u00a0\nHistorically, the spaces were used \"to store (as well as to count and polish) the family silver, numerous sets of china, and large serving dishes like platters, tureens, and coffee urns.\"\n\"Today, butler's pantries are located just off the kitchen or dining room and are used as staging areas for serving meals, and as a storage space. In a butler's pantry, you'll commonly find a countertop and cabinets for keeping serving pieces, tableware, wine glasses, table linens, candles, and other items for the dining room.\"\nButler\u2019s pantries were fairly common in middle-class houses from the 1920s, according to Myrick Howard,\u00a0 president of Preservation North Carolina, a private nonprofit that aims to restore historic properties.\n\"You wouldn\u2019t call it a butler\u2019s pantry in 2020 because you don\u2019t have a pantry. It\u2019s the same thing you\u2019d probably call a wet bar.\"\nCunningham doesn\u2019t have a butler, nor has he ever, campaign spokesman Aaron Simpson said.\nTillis comments\nIt\u2019s debatable whether this tax credit program is for \"the wealthy.\" Of course, people who don\u2019t have enough money to own a house wouldn\u2019t qualify. At the same time, some who qualify might be middle-class. (We won\u2019t even attempt to draw those lines.)\nHowever, the Cunningham campaign pointed out that Tillis has praised historic tax credits in the past.\nAlthough Tillis didn\u2019t vote, he was speaker in 2011 when the state House voted to extend the tax credit for renovations to historic homes -- along with other tax provisions.\nWhen the tax credit was left out of a state budget proposal in 2014, Tillis was speaker of the state House. According to the Winston-Salem Journal, Tillis said the credits had shown a \"well-documented return on investment.\"\nNorth Carolina offers credits for both residential properties, as well as commercial or what the state calls \"income producing property.\" Since the first credits were enacted back in 1998, they\u2019ve promoted more than $3 billion in renovations to commercial and residential properties, Howard said.\nAnother article from 2014, this one in the Wilson Daily Times, quoted Tillis saying the historic tax credit had helped North Carolina. \"That particular program has been a very positive thing for towns. It is a return on investment,\" Tillis is quoted saying in the article. The Cunningham campaign provided a hard copy to PolitiFact.\nOur ruling\nTillis said Cunningham \"got a $40,000 tax incentive to update his butler\u2019s pantry.\"\nThat\u2019s not as far off-base as his campaign\u2019s press release or the NRSC ad, which exaggerate the facts. But they still need clarification.\nThe tax credit was for more than just the butler\u2019s pantry. In Cunningham\u2019s case, the term is used to reference a space in his kitchen -- not a closet used by an employee.\nTillis\u2019 statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
