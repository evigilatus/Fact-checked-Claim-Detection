0001	LESLEY STAHL	Do you still think that climate change is a hoax?
0002	TRUMP	I think something's happening.
0003	TRUMP	Something's changing and it'll change back again.
0004	TRUMP	I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference.
0005	TRUMP	But I don't know that it's manmade.
0006	TRUMP	I will say this.
0007	TRUMP	I don't wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars.
0008	TRUMP	I don't wanna lose millions and millions of jobs.
0009	TRUMP	I don't wanna be put at a disadvantage.
0010	LESLEY STAHL	I wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels.
0011	TRUMP	And you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man.
0012	TRUMP	You don't know.
0013	LESLEY STAHL	Well, your scientists, your scientists
0014	TRUMP	No, we have
0015	LESLEY STAHL	At NOAA and NASA
0016	TRUMP	We have scientists that disagree with that.
0017	LESLEY STAHL	You know, I was thinking what if he said, "No, I've seen the hurricane situations, I've changed my mind. There really is climate change."
0018	LESLEY STAHL	And I thought, "Wow, what an impact."
0019	TRUMP	Well I'm not denying.
0020	LESLEY STAHL	What an impact that would make.
0021	TRUMP	I'm not denying climate change.
0022	TRUMP	But it could very well go back.
0023	TRUMP	You know, we're talkin' about over a millions
0024	LESLEY STAHL	But that's denying it.
0025	TRUMP	of years.
0026	TRUMP	They say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael.
0027	LESLEY STAHL	Who says that?
0028	LESLEY STAHL	They say?
0029	TRUMP	People say.
0030	TRUMP	People say that in the
0031	LESLEY STAHL	Yeah, but what about the scientists who say it's worse than ever?
0032	TRUMP	You'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley.
0033	LESLEY STAHL	I can't bring them in.
0034	TRUMP	Look, scientists also have a political agenda.
0035	LESLEY STAHL	Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist
0036	TRUMP	Yes.
0037	TRUMP	Yes.
0038	LESLEY STAHL	the Saudi journalist, was he murdered by the Saudis?
0039	LESLEY STAHL	And did the prince give the order to kill him?
0040	TRUMP	Nobody knows yet, but we'll probably be able to find out.
0041	TRUMP	It's being investigated.
0042	TRUMP	It's being looked at very, very strongly.
0043	TRUMP	And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case.
0044	TRUMP	As of this moment, they deny it.
0045	TRUMP	And den deny it vehemently.
0046	TRUMP	Could it be them?
0047	TRUMP	Yes.
0048	LESLEY STAHL	Jared, your soninlaw.
0049	LESLEY STAHL	Got on the phone and asked the prince.
0050	LESLEY STAHL	Did he deny it?
0051	LESLEY STAHL	Did he
0052	TRUMP	They deny it.
0053	TRUMP	They deny it every way you can imagine.
0054	TRUMP	In the nottoodistant future, I think we'll know an answer.
0055	LESLEY STAHL	What are you options?
0056	LESLEY STAHL	Let's say they did.
0057	LESLEY STAHL	What are your options?
0058	LESLEY STAHL	Would you consider imposing sanctions, as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed?
0059	TRUMP	Well, it depends on what the sanction is.
0060	TRUMP	I'll give ya an example.
0061	TRUMP	They are ordering military equipment.
0062	TRUMP	Everybody in the world wanted that order.
0063	TRUMP	Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it.
0064	TRUMP	We got it.
0065	LESLEY STAHL	So would you cut that off
0066	TRUMP	I tell you what I don't wanna do.
0067	TRUMP	Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com I don't wanna hurt jobs.
0068	TRUMP	I don't wanna lose an order like that.
0069	TRUMP	There are other ways of punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word, but it's true.
0070	LESLEY STAHL	Tell everybody what's at stake here.
0071	LESLEY STAHL	You know
0072	TRUMP	Well, there's a lot at stake.
0073	TRUMP	There's a lot at stake.
0074	TRUMP	And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter.
0075	TRUMP	There's something you'll be surprised to hear me say that.
0076	TRUMP	There's something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case.
0077	TRUMP	So we're gonna have to see.
0078	TRUMP	We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment.
0079	LESLEY STAHL	You've had a string of wins lately.
0080	LESLEY STAHL	Let's see, the economy, the d the trade deal
0081	TRUMP	Right.
0082	LESLEY STAHL	With Canada and Mexico, Kavanaugh
0083	TRUMP	And South Korea.
0084	LESLEY STAHL	And South Korea.
0085	LESLEY STAHL	And Kavanaugh, the confirmation.
0086	TRUMP	There has been no administration in the history of our country, and I say this openly and proudly, that in its first two years
0087	LESLEY STAHL	Say, this is modesty.
0088	TRUMP	Well, it's not even that, it's a fact Tax cuts, regulation cuts, the biggest regulations cuts in history.
0089	LESLEY STAHL	What about North Korea?
0090	LESLEY STAHL	Talking about accom
0091	TRUMP	Well, I consider it a, so far, great achievement.
0092	TRUMP	Look, we
0093	LESLEY STAHL	You say "so far"?
0094	TRUMP	It's always so far, til everything's done.
0095	TRUMP	I I you know, deals are deals, okay?
0096	TRUMP	Whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal, it doesn't matter.
0097	TRUMP	But I will say this.
0098	TRUMP	The day before I came in, we were goin' to war with North Korea.
0099	TRUMP	I sat with President Obama
0100	LESLEY STAHL	We were goin' to war?
0101	TRUMP	and we were gonnaI think it was going to end up in war.
0102	TRUMP	And my impression is and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get.
0103	TRUMP	Doesn't get any tougher than that.
0104	TRUMP	Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough.
0105	TRUMP	We were going to war with North Korea.
0106	TRUMP	Now, you don't hear that.
0107	TRUMP	You don't hear any talk of it.
0108	TRUMP	And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it.
0109	TRUMP	And you see that, he's agreed to it.
0110	TRUMP	No missiles.
0111	LESLEY STAHL	Do you trust him?
0112	TRUMP	I do trust him, yeah, I trust him.
0113	TRUMP	That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong 
0114	LESLEY STAHL	Why would
0115	TRUMP	about it?
0116	LESLEY STAHL	you trust him?
0117	TRUMP	Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you.
0118	TRUMP	Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes
0119	LESLEY STAHL	Well, remember what Reagan said.
0120	LESLEY STAHL	Trust, but verify.
0121	TRUMP	Sure.
0122	TRUMP	I know.
0123	TRUMP	It's it's very true.
0124	TRUMP	But the fact is, I do trust him.
0125	TRUMP	But we'll see what happens.
0126	LESLEY STAHL	But is it true that they haven't gotten rid of a single weapon, and they may actually be building more missiles
0127	TRUMP	They want to
0128	LESLEY STAHL	With nuclear
0129	TRUMP	And I will tell you that they're closing up sites.
0130	LESLEY STAHL	But
0131	TRUMP	Setting it up.
0132	LESLEY STAHL	Is what I said true, that they haven't?
0133	LESLEY STAHL	Gotten
0134	TRUMP	Well, nobody really knows.
0135	TRUMP	I mean, people are saying that.
0136	TRUMP	I've actually said that.
0137	LESLEY STAHL	What?
0138	LESLEY STAHL	That they're still building missiles, more missiles?
0139	TRUMP	We don't really know, Lesley.
0140	TRUMP	We really don't know.
0141	TRUMP	But I assume
0142	LESLEY STAHL	Suspect that?
0143	TRUMP	Let's say the answer is yes, okay?
0144	TRUMP	In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile.
0145	TRUMP	They haven't tested a rocket.
0146	TRUMP	They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast.
0147	TRUMP	It sort of moves the earth.
0148	TRUMP	And we have a relationship now.
0149	LESLEY STAHL	One of the things that Kim has asked for is for you to ease the sanctions.
0150	TRUMP	We haven't done that.
0151	LESLEY STAHL	Are you prepared to do that?
0152	LESLEY STAHL	What what does he have to do
0153	TRUMP	No, no.
0154	TRUMP	I
0155	LESLEY STAHL	Before you're
0156	TRUMP	No I'm not doing it.
0157	TRUMP	This isn't the Obama administration.
0158	TRUMP	I haven't eased the sanctions.
0159	TRUMP	I haven't done anything.
0160	TRUMP	I haven't done anything.
0161	TRUMP	We're meeting.
0162	TRUMP	I believe he likes me.
0163	TRUMP	I like him.
0164	TRUMP	We have a good relationship.
0165	TRUMP	It's very important.
0166	LESLEY STAHL	I wanna read you his resume, okay?
0167	LESLEY STAHL	He presides over a cruel kingdom of repression, gulags, starvation reports that he had his halfbrother assassinated, slave labor, public executions.
0168	LESLEY STAHL	This is a guy you love?
0169	TRUMP	Sure.
0170	TRUMP	I know all these things.
0171	TRUMP	I mean I'm not a baby.
0172	TRUMP	I know these things.
0173	LESLEY STAHL	I know, but why do you love that guy?
0174	TRUMP	Look, look.
0175	TRUMP	I I I like I get along with him, okay?
0176	LESLEY STAHL	But you love him.
0177	TRUMP	Okay.
0178	TRUMP	That's just a figure of speech.
0179	LESLEY STAHL	No, it's like an embrace.
0180	TRUMP	It well, let it be an embrace.
0181	TRUMP	Let it be whatever it is to get the job done.
0182	LESLEY STAHL	He's a bad guy.
0183	TRUMP	Look.
0184	TRUMP	Let it be whatever it is.
0185	TRUMP	I get along with him really well.
0186	TRUMP	I have a good energy with him.
0187	TRUMP	I have a good chemistry with him.
0188	TRUMP	Look at the horrible threats that were made.
0189	TRUMP	No more threats.
0190	TRUMP	No more threats.
0191	LESLEY STAHL	China.
0192	TRUMP	I get along with him.
0193	TRUMP	It's very important.
0194	TRUMP	China, let's go.
0195	LESLEY STAHL	I'm skipping across the world here.
0196	LESLEY STAHL	You've slapped a lot of tariffs
0197	TRUMP	$250 billion.
0198	LESLEY STAHL	Gonna do more?
0199	TRUMP	Might.
0200	TRUMP	Might.
0201	LESLEY STAHL	Round three?
0202	TRUMP	They wanna negotiate, Lesley.
0203	TRUMP	They wanna negotiate.
0204	LESLEY STAHL	Are you ready?
0205	TRUMP	Look.
0206	LESLEY STAHL	Are you ready to
0207	TRUMP	I have a great chemistry also with President Xi of China.
0208	TRUMP	I don't know that that's necessarily going to continue.
0209	TRUMP	I told President Xi we cannot continue to have China take $500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things.
0210	LESLEY STAHL	And how how
0211	TRUMP	And I said we can't do that, and we're not gonna do that anymore.
0212	LESLEY STAHL	How much squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are gonna be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all this?
0213	TRUMP	Okay.
0214	TRUMP	Okay.
0215	TRUMP	So, so far, that hasn't turned out to be the case.
0216	LESLEY STAHL	Some
0217	TRUMP	if you think about it, so far, I put 25% tariffs on steel dumping, and aluminum dumping 10%.
0218	LESLEY STAHL	But they've
0219	TRUMP	again.
0220	LESLEY STAHL	retaliated.
0221	LESLEY STAHL	That's what I'm asking.
0222	TRUMP	They can retaliate, but they can't they don't have enough ammunition to retaliate.
0223	TRUMP	We do $100 billion with them.
0224	TRUMP	They do $531 billion with us.
0225	LESLEY STAHL	Are you trying to sort of push them into a depression?
0226	TRUMP	No no, although they're down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929.
0227	LESLEY STAHL	Well that's what I'm asking.
0228	TRUMP	I don't want that.
0229	TRUMP	No, I don't want that.
0230	TRUMP	I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us.
0231	TRUMP	I want them to open their markets like our our markets are open.
0232	LESLEY STAHL	But you're in a
0233	TRUMP	And it will be a fair deal
0234	LESLEY STAHL	trade war right now.
0235	LESLEY STAHL	Trade war.
0236	TRUMP	You call it war, I don't call
0237	LESLEY STAHL	You you
0238	TRUMP	it
0239	LESLEY STAHL	you did today.
0240	TRUMP	I called it a skirmish.
0241	LESLEY STAHL	I heard you, you called it a war.
0242	TRUMP	I called it, actually I called it a battle.
0243	TRUMP	But, actually, I'm gonna lower that.
0244	TRUMP	I consider it a skirmish.
0245	TRUMP	And we're gonna win.
0246	LESLEY STAHL	You have also slapped some tariffs on our allies.
0247	TRUMP	I mean, what's an ally?
0248	TRUMP	We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people.
0249	TRUMP	But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union.
0250	TRUMP	The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that's what they've done.
0251	LESLEY STAHL	But this is hostile.
0252	TRUMP	And yet, they it's not hostile.
0253	LESLEY STAHL	It sounds hostile.
0254	TRUMP	You know what's hostile?
0255	TRUMP	The way they treat us.
0256	TRUMP	We're not hostile.
0257	LESLEY STAHL	No, but can't you deal with
0258	TRUMP	We've been we've been
0259	LESLEY STAHL	them without
0260	TRUMP	the stupid country for so many years.
0261	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing to get rid of that Western alliance?
0262	TRUMP	Now, I like NATO, NATO's fine.
0263	TRUMP	But you know what?
0264	TRUMP	We shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe.
0265	TRUMP	And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade.
0266	TRUMP	They're not going to do it anymore.
0267	TRUMP	They understand that.
0268	LESLEY STAHL	Okay, but are, it does seem this, are you willing to disrupt the Western Alliance?
0269	LESLEY STAHL	It's been going for 70 years.
0270	LESLEY STAHL	It's kept the peace for 70 years.
0271	TRUMP	You don't know that.
0272	TRUMP	You don't know that.
0273	LESLEY STAHL	I don't know what?
0274	TRUMP	You don't know that.
0275	LESLEY STAHL	Is it true General Mattis said to you, "The reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War III?"
0276	TRUMP	No, it's not true.
0277	LESLEY STAHL	What's not true?
0278	TRUMP	Frankly, I like General Mattis.
0279	TRUMP	I think I know more about it than he does.
0280	TRUMP	And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you.
0281	LESLEY STAHL	I'm gonna try one more time.
0282	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.
0283	TRUMP	I know and, Lesley, you don't have to try again.
0284	TRUMP	I know exactly what you're saying
0285	LESLEY STAHL	Well, answer my question.
0286	TRUMP	The answer is this.
0287	TRUMP	I will always be there with NATO, but they have to pay their way.
0288	TRUMP	I'm fully in favor of NATO, but I don't wanna be taken advantage of.
0289	LESLEY STAHL	Putin.
0290	TRUMP	Yeah.
0291	LESLEY STAHL	Okay, people don't understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin.
0292	TRUMP	Okay, you ready?
0293	LESLEY STAHL	I don't understand it.
0294	TRUMP	I have been you don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference
0295	LESLEY STAHL	No, I mean publicly.
0296	LESLEY STAHL	You never say anything harsh about him
0297	TRUMP	Excuse me.
0298	LESLEY STAHL	publicly.
0299	TRUMP	I didn't?
0300	TRUMP	I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers.
0301	TRUMP	Obama didn't.
0302	TRUMP	You know what he sent?
0303	TRUMP	He sent pillows and blankets.
0304	TRUMP	I'm the one and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this
0305	LESLEY STAHL	Well, I mean him personally Vladimir Putin
0306	TRUMP	I think I'm very tough with him personally.
0307	TRUMP	I had a meeting with him.
0308	TRUMP	The two of us.
0309	TRUMP	It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting.
0310	LESLEY STAHL	Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations?
0311	LESLEY STAHL	In poisonings?
0312	TRUMP	Probably he is, yeah.
0313	TRUMP	Probably.
0314	TRUMP	I mean, I don't
0315	LESLEY STAHL	Probably?
0316	TRUMP	But I rely on them, it's not in our country.
0317	LESLEY STAHL	Why not they shouldn't do it.
0318	LESLEY STAHL	This is a terrible thing.
0319	TRUMP	Of course they shouldn't do it
0320	LESLEY STAHL	Instead do you believe
0321	TRUMP	That's your (Inaudible.)
0322	LESLEY STAHL	do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election?
0323	LESLEY STAHL	Our election
0324	TRUMP	They they meddled.
0325	TRUMP	But I think China meddled too.
0326	LESLEY STAHL	But why do you
0327	TRUMP	And I think other countries
0328	LESLEY STAHL	say China meddled too?
0329	TRUMP	And you wanna know something?
0330	LESLEY STAHL	Why do you say Chi why don't you just say
0331	TRUMP	Well, let me ask you
0332	LESLEY STAHL	the Russians meddled?
0333	TRUMP	Because I think China meddled also.
0334	TRUMP	And I think, frankly, China
0335	LESLEY STAHL	This is amazing.
0336	TRUMP	is a bigger problem.
0337	LESLEY STAHL	You are diverting the whole Russia thing.
0338	TRUMP	I'm not doing anything.
0339	LESLEY STAHL	You are, you are
0340	TRUMP	I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China.
0341	LESLEY STAHL	What about the attorney general, Jeff Sessions?
0342	TRUMP	Well, we'll see what happens come midterms.
0343	TRUMP	But
0344	LESLEY STAHL	But everybody thinks, given the things you've said
0345	TRUMP	I was disappointed that he recused himself and many people think I was right on that.
0346	TRUMP	I was very disappointed.
0347	TRUMP	Why should he have recused himself?
0348	TRUMP	So I was very
0349	LESLEY STAHL	So
0350	TRUMP	disappointed but
0351	LESLEY STAHL	So can I assume
0352	TRUMP	we'll see what happens.
0353	LESLEY STAHL	Can I assume he's gone?
0354	TRUMP	No.
0355	TRUMP	No.
0356	TRUMP	You can't assume that.
0357	LESLEY STAHL	Will you.
0358	LESLEY STAHL	Will you pledge pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation?
0359	TRUMP	Well, I I don't pledge anything.
0360	TRUMP	But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that.
0361	TRUMP	I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind.
0362	LESLEY STAHL	But you won't pledge
0363	TRUMP	There is no collusion.
0364	TRUMP	I don't wanna pledge.
0365	TRUMP	Why should I pledge to you?
0366	TRUMP	If I pledge, I'll pledge.
0367	TRUMP	I don't have to pledge to you.
0368	TRUMP	But I have
0369	LESLEY STAHL	Well
0370	TRUMP	I have no intention of doing that.
0371	TRUMP	Do you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election?
0372	TRUMP	Give me a break.
0373	TRUMP	They wouldn't be able to help me at all.
0374	TRUMP	Call Russia.
0375	TRUMP	It's so ridiculous.
0376	LESLEY STAHL	So you've been president for almost two years.
0377	LESLEY STAHL	Is there anything that you wish you hadn't said, anything you wish you hadn't done?
0378	LESLEY STAHL	Do you have any regrets?
0379	TRUMP	So when I won the presidency, I th I I the press treats me terribly.
0380	TRUMP	I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great.
0381	TRUMP	Lesley, they treat me worse.
0382	TRUMP	They got worse instead of better.
0383	TRUMP	Very dishonest.
0384	LESLEY STAHL	Okay, this you're but you regret?
0385	TRUMP	I regret that the press treats me so badly
0386	LESLEY STAHL	I'm I'm really asking (Inaudible.)
0387	TRUMP	And despite that, my poll numbers are very good, so.
0388	LESLEY STAHL	Have you made any mistakes?
0389	LESLEY STAHL	That's my question.
0390	TRUMP	Everybody makes mistakes.
0391	LESLEY STAHL	And what have been yours?
0392	TRUMP	I could have been earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal.
0393	TRUMP	The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders.
0394	TRUMP	I was getting to know countries.
0395	TRUMP	I didn't wanna do it right outta the box.
0396	TRUMP	So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier.
0397	LESLEY STAHL	What about the forced separation of children from their migrant children
0398	TRUMP	Yeah.
0399	TRUMP	Well, that was
0400	LESLEY STAHL	from the
0401	TRUMP	the same as the Obama law.
0402	TRUMP	You know, Obama had the same thing.
0403	LESLEY STAHL	It was on the books, but he didn't enforce it.
0404	LESLEY STAHL	Youenforced it.
0405	LESLEY STAHL	You launched that the zero tolerance policy to deter families with children coming
0406	TRUMP	No, but then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation.
0407	TRUMP	And frankly, when you don't do separa when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country.
0408	LESLEY STAHL	So are you gonna go back to that?
0409	TRUMP	Well, we're looking at a lot of things.
0410	TRUMP	Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were they were a laughing stock all over the world.
0411	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing though I think that you're saying you're it's under consideration.
0412	TRUMP	No, I want all the laws changed.
0413	LESLEY STAHL	But the children specifically
0414	TRUMP	there have to be consequences, Lesley, for coming into our country illegally.
0415	TRUMP	And part of the r I mean, part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States.
0416	LESLEY STAHL	Can I just ask this simple question, yes or no.
0417	TRUMP	Go ahead.
0418	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing to reinstitute that policy?
0419	LESLEY STAHL	You said, "We're looking at everything."
0420	TRUMP	I will
0421	LESLEY STAHL	Yes or no.
0422	TRUMP	I will only I can't you can't say yes or no.
0423	TRUMP	What I can say is this There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.
0424	LESLEY STAHL	I'm not gonna ask it again
0425	TRUMP	You don't have to.
0426	LESLEY STAHL	cause I know you won't it
0427	TRUMP	But it's the same as Obama.
0428	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.
0429	LESLEY STAHL	Changing subjects again you are the first president of the United States who never had a political post before, nor never served in the military.
0430	LESLEY STAHL	You come up here, you've been here for almost two years, what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president?
0431	TRUMP	Okay.
0432	TRUMP	So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah.
0433	TRUMP	Now I say they're babies.
0434	LESLEY STAHL	Who's the toughest?
0435	TRUMP	They're babies, the political people.
0436	TRUMP	This is the most deceptive, vicious world.
0437	TRUMP	It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception.
0438	TRUMP	You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table.
0439	LESLEY STAHL	Give me an example.
0440	TRUMP	Well, I don't wanna give you an example.
0441	TRUMP	I'm not lookin' to in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do.
0442	TRUMP	Remember that.
0443	TRUMP	When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at making deals with other countries.
0444	TRUMP	Nobody's been able to do anything like this.
0445	TRUMP	Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it.
0446	TRUMP	But it's a very deceptive world.
0447	TRUMP	The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was.
0448	TRUMP	I I and I really mean it.
0449	TRUMP	I'm not saying that as a sound bite.
0450	TRUMP	I never
0451	LESLEY STAHL	I'd like to
0452	TRUMP	Knew how dishonest
0453	LESLEY STAHL	I'm I'm gonna change the subject again.
0454	TRUMP	Well, no, even the way you asked me a question, like, about separation.
0455	TRUMP	When I say Obama did it, you don't wanna talk about it.
0456	LESLEY STAHL	No, I'm gonna run your
0457	TRUMP	When I say I did it, let's make a big deal of it.
0458	LESLEY STAHL	I'm gonna run your answer, but you did it four times, so.
0459	TRUMP	I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject.
0460	LESLEY STAHL	I disagree, but I don't wanna have that fight with you.
0461	TRUMP	Hey, it's okay
0462	LESLEY STAHL	All right, I'll get in another fight with you
0463	TRUMP	Lesley, it's okay.
0464	TRUMP	In the meantime, I'm presidentand you're not.
0465	LESLEY STAHL	This country is divided, polarized.
0466	LESLEY STAHL	Within families, there aren't even people who can talk to each other.
0467	LESLEY STAHL	What does this say about where we are as a country right now, all this division and strife and
0468	TRUMP	Yeah I think that
0469	LESLEY STAHL	anger?
0470	TRUMP	what's going to happen I think the economy's bringing people together.
0471	TRUMP	It was very polarized under President Obama, unbelievably polarized under President Obama.
0472	TRUMP	I can see the country uniting.
0473	TRUMP	I can see it.
0474	TRUMP	We have people, Democrats, who behaved horribly during the Judge Kavanaugh you know what I'm saying.
0475	LESLEY STAHL	But when you won that.
0476	TRUMP	during the hearings for the Supreme Court, we had senators that behaved horribly.
0477	LESLEY STAHL	But when you won, you won.
0478	LESLEY STAHL	No no one is gonna argue with that.
0479	TRUMP	I won
0480	LESLEY STAHL	You won.
0481	LESLEY STAHL	And then after you won, instead of saying, "Oh, let's all come together, this is wonderful.
0482	LESLEY STAHL	Let's heal all of this," you come out and bash the Democrats.
0483	TRUMP	Well, I bashed their attitude.
0484	TRUMP	I bashed their statements
0485	LESLEY STAHL	But why not try to
0486	TRUMP	Because they were
0487	LESLEY STAHL	bring us together?
0488	TRUMP	so unfair to Judge Kavanaugh.
0489	TRUMP	I've never
0490	LESLEY STAHL	But why not
0491	TRUMP	seen anything like it.
0492	LESLEY STAHL	why not try and we need to be healed.
0493	LESLEY STAHL	We need
0494	TRUMP	I don't think they want to heal yet, I'll be honest.
0495	LESLEY STAHL	Well, you don't wanna
0496	TRUMP	I think
0497	LESLEY STAHL	heal yet.
0498	TRUMP	I I I saw Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement.
0499	TRUMP	I don't think they wanna be healed.
0500	TRUMP	I do wanna heal.
0501	LESLEY STAHL	I'm n I'm not talking about Democrat I'm talking about the country.
0502	LESLEY STAHL	You go out and you go to Mississippi.
0503	TRUMP	The famous Mississippi speech?
0504	LESLEY STAHL	And you mimicked Professor Blasey Ford.
0505	LESLEY STAHL	You mimicked her.
0506	TRUMP	Had I not made that speech, we would not have won.
0507	TRUMP	I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything.
0508	LESLEY STAHL	No (Inaudible.)
0509	TRUMP	And you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary.
0510	LESLEY STAHL	Why did you have to make fun of her?
0511	TRUMP	I didn't really make fun of her.
0512	LESLEY STAHL	Well, they were laughing.
0513	TRUMP	What I said the person that we're talking about didn't know the year, the time, the place.
0514	LESLEY STAHL	Professor Blasey Ford got before the Senate and and was asked what's the worst moment.
0515	LESLEY STAHL	And she said, "When the two boys laughed at me, at my expense."
0516	TRUMP	Ok, fine.
0517	LESLEY STAHL	And then I watched you mimic her and thousands of people were laughing at her.
0518	TRUMP	They can do what they I I will tell you this.
0519	TRUMP	The way now Justice Kavanaugh was treated has become a big factor in the midterms.
0520	TRUMP	Have you seen what's gone on with the polls?
0521	LESLEY STAHL	But did you have to
0522	TRUMP	Well, I think she was treated with great respect, I'll I'll
0523	LESLEY STAHL	And but
0524	TRUMP	be honest with you.
0525	LESLEY STAHL	but do you thinkyou treated her with
0526	TRUMP	There are those that think she shouldn't have
0527	LESLEY STAHL	Do you think you treated her with respect?
0528	TRUMP	I think so, yeah.
0529	TRUMP	I did.
0530	LESLEY STAHL	But you seem to be saying that she lied.
0531	TRUMP	W you know what?
0532	TRUMP	I'm not gonna get into it because we won.
0533	TRUMP	It doesn't matter.
0534	TRUMP	We won.
0535	LESLEY STAHL	The anonymous column that ran in "The New York Times."
0536	LESLEY STAHL	The author, we don't know who it is.
0537	LESLEY STAHL	Whoever it is.
0538	TRUMP	Whoever it is.
0539	TRUMP	Maybe it was "The New York Times" too.
0540	LESLEY STAHL	Paints a picture.
0541	TRUMP	No, no, it's By the way, you don't know how dishonest "The New York Times" is.
0542	TRUMP	It could've been "The New York Times."
0543	TRUMP	I doubt it.
0544	TRUMP	But it could've been.
0545	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.
0546	LESLEY STAHL	I doubt it too.
0547	TRUMP	It also could've been any w well, don't count on it.
0548	TRUMP	It also could've been any one of 3,000 people.
0549	LESLEY STAHL	You have said that this administration is like a smoothrunning machine.
0550	LESLEY STAHL	And yet, we keep hearing that the White House is in chaos.
0551	TRUMP	It's wrong, it's so false.
0552	TRUMP	It's fake news.
0553	TRUMP	I'm changing things around.
0554	TRUMP	And I'm entitled to.
0555	TRUMP	I have people now on standby that will be phenomenal.
0556	TRUMP	They'll come into the administration, they'll be phenomenal.
0557	LESLEY STAHL	More people gonna go?
0558	TRUMP	Yeah, other people will go, sure.
0559	LESLEY STAHL	Cause so many people, you have kind of a record of on turnover.
0560	TRUMP	I think I have a great Cabinet.
0561	TRUMP	There're some people that I'm not happy with.
0562	LESLEY STAHL	Who are you not happy with?
0563	TRUMP	No, I don't wanna say that but
0564	LESLEY STAHL	Come on.
0565	TRUMP	Not I don't want to say that.
0566	LESLEY STAHL	What about General Mattis?
0567	LESLEY STAHL	Is he going to leave?
0568	TRUMP	Well, I don't know.
0569	TRUMP	He hasn't told me that.
0570	TRUMP	I have
0571	LESLEY STAHL	Do you want him to
0572	TRUMP	a very good relationship with him.
0573	TRUMP	It could be that he is.
0574	TRUMP	I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you wanna know the truth.
0575	TRUMP	But General Mattis is a good guy.
0576	TRUMP	We get along very well.
0577	TRUMP	He may leave.
0578	TRUMP	I mean, at some point, everybody leaves.
0579	TRUMP	Everybody.
0580	TRUMP	People leave.
0581	TRUMP	That's Washington.
0582	LESLEY STAHL	The first lady, Melania.
0583	LESLEY STAHL	She said that there are still people in the White House that she doesn't trust and that you shouldn't trust.
0584	TRUMP	I feel the same way.
0585	TRUMP	I don't trust everybody in the White House, I'll be honest with you.
0586	LESLEY STAHL	You go to a meeting, do you have to wonder, "Is he wearing a wire"
0587	TRUMP	I'm usually 
0588	LESLEY STAHL	or whatever?
0589	TRUMP	Not so much a wire.
0590	TRUMP	I'm usually guarded.
0591	TRUMP	And I think I'm guarded anyway.
0592	TRUMP	But I'm not saying I trust everybody in the White House.
0593	TRUMP	I'm not a baby.
0594	TRUMP	It's a tough business.
0595	TRUMP	This is a r this is a vicious place.
0596	TRUMP	Washington DC is a vicious, vicious place.
0597	TRUMP	The attacks, the the bad mouthing, the speaking behind your back.
0598	TRUMP	but you know, and in my way, I feel very comfortable here.
0599	LESLEY STAHL	It takes a president a while to find his sea legs.
0600	TRUMP	I think so.
0601	TRUMP	I mean, I felt comfortable at the beginning, other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United States, but I think that's true with everybody.
0602	LESLEY STAHL	POTUS.
0603	TRUMP	Now I very much feel like POTUS.
0604	TRUMP	I do.
0605	TRUMP	I feel like the president.
0606	TRUMP	You know, for a little while, it's like "Mr. President, sir."
0607	TRUMP	It's even my friends, they call me, they they don't call me Donald they call me Mr. President.
0608	TRUMP	And I say, "Will you please loosen up?"
0609	TRUMP	I've learned on the job.
0610	TRUMP	I have.
0611	LESLEY STAHL	And you feel comfortable?
0612	TRUMP	I feel very comfortable, yeah.
