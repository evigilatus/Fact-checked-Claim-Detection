After news of the scandal broke, lawmakers asked the inspector general to investigate the scale of the VA application backlog and the deaths that resulted.\nInvestigators found a data system in chaos. The problems included:\n\n\nIn 2014, the VA\u2019s database contained applications for people who died before 1998.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the course of moving millions of records around in 2013, the VA inadvertently created enrollment entries for people \"who never sought care or applied for enrollment.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

In any event, 84% of the total died before 2010, the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s second year.\nInvestigators described the VA\u2019s enrollment system as \"virtually unreliable.\"\nWe reached out to the Trump campaign.
