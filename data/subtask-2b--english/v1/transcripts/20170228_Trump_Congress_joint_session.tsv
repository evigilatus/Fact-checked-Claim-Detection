0003	Donald Trump	...and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done. Recent threats...
0004	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0005	Donald Trump	Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.
0006	Donald Trump	Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.
0007	Donald Trump	That torch is now in our hands.
0008	Donald Trump	And we will use it to light up the world.
0009	Donald Trump	I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter...

0012	Donald Trump	A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.
0013	Donald Trump	And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.
0014	Donald Trump	What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.
0015	Donald Trump	Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.
0016	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0017	Donald Trump	All the nations of the world  friend or foe  will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.
0018	Donald Trump	In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence.
0019	Donald Trump	It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.
0020	Donald Trump	But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year?
0021	Donald Trump	What kind of country will we leave for our children?
0022	Donald Trump	I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.
0023	Donald Trump	For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.
0024	Donald Trump	We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.
0025	Donald Trump	We've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross

0027	Donald Trump	, and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.
0028	Donald Trump	And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
0029	Donald Trump	Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet.
0030	Donald Trump	The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.
0031	Donald Trump	But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.
0032	Donald Trump	Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again.
0033	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0034	Donald Trump	Dying industries will come roaring back to life.
0035	Donald Trump	Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.

0037	Donald Trump	Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.
0038	Donald Trump	Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop.
0039	Donald Trump	And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.
0040	Donald Trump	Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.
0041	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0042	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0043	Donald Trump	It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.
0044	Donald Trump	Since my election, Ford, FiatChrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.
0045	SYSTEM	[Applause]

0049	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0050	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0051	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0052	Donald Trump	And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce jobcrushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency...
0053	SYSTEM	[Applause]

0064	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0065	Donald Trump	We have withdrawn the United States from the jobkilling TransPacific Partnership.
0066	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0067	Donald Trump	And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
0068	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0069	Donald Trump	To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime.
0070	Donald Trump	I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation.
0071	SYSTEM	[Fact check True, but they don't do much.]

0073	Donald Trump	We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.
0074	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0075	Donald Trump	At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.
0076	SYSTEM	[Applause]

0082	Donald Trump	We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.

0084	Donald Trump	For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.
0085	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0086	Donald Trump	As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.
0087	SYSTEM	[Fact check Not a big change.]
0088	Donald Trump	Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.
0089	Donald Trump	To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?
0090	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0091	Donald Trump	Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States.
0092	Donald Trump	We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.
0093	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0094	Donald Trump	According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorismrelated offenses since 911 came here from outside of our country.
0095	Donald Trump	We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center.
0096	Donald Trump	We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.
0097	Donald Trump	It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.
0098	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0099	Donald Trump	Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
0100	Donald Trump	We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
0101	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0102	Donald Trump	That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm.
0103	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0104	Donald Trump	As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs.
0105	Donald Trump	We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.
0106	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0107	Donald Trump	I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.

0111	Donald Trump	I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.

0114	Donald Trump	Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.
0115	Donald Trump	To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law.
0116	Donald Trump	He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.
0117	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0118	Donald Trump	Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.
0119	Donald Trump	Ninetyfour million Americans are out of the labor force.
0120	SYSTEM	[Fact check This is misleading.]
0121	Donald Trump	Over 43 million people are now living in poverty.
0122	SYSTEM	[Fact check True  but the number has also fallen.]
0123	Donald Trump	And over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.
0124	SYSTEM	[Fact check The number is correct.]
0125	Donald Trump	More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working.
0126	Donald Trump	We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.
0127	Donald Trump	In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.
0128	Donald Trump	We've lost more than onefourth of our manufacturing jobs since Nafta was approved
0129	SYSTEM	[Fact check Not because of Nafta. ]
0130	Donald Trump	, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
0131	Donald Trump	Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion.
0132	Donald Trump	And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.
0133	Donald Trump	Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.
0134	Donald Trump	It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.
0135	Donald Trump	But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.
0136	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0137	Donald Trump	Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.
0138	Donald Trump	My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
0139	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0140	Donald Trump	It will be a big, big cut.
0141	Donald Trump	At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.
0142	Donald Trump	We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers  have to do it.
0143	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0144	Donald Trump	Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.
0145	Donald Trump	I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, HarleyDavidson.
0146	Donald Trump	In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.
0147	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0148	Donald Trump	And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, "No, thank you."
0149	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0150	Donald Trump	At our meeting, I asked them, "How are you doing?
0151	Donald Trump	How is business?"
0152	Donald Trump	They said that it's good.
0153	Donald Trump	I asked them further, "How are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?"
0154	Donald Trump	They told me  without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it  that it's very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate.
0155	Donald Trump	They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.
0156	Donald Trump	They weren't even asking for a change.
0157	Donald Trump	But I am. I believe...
0158	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0159	Donald Trump	I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade.
0160	Donald Trump	It's been a long time since we had fair trade.
0161	Donald Trump	The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that "the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."
0162	Donald Trump	Lincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words.
0163	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0164	Donald Trump	I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken  advantage of us any longer.
0165	Donald Trump	They have taken advantage of our country no longer.
0166	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0167	Donald Trump	I am going to bring back millions of jobs.
0168	Donald Trump	Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.
0169	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0170	Donald Trump	The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.
0171	Donald Trump	Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a meritbased immigration system.
0172	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0173	Donald Trump	It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.
0174	Donald Trump	Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.
0175	Donald Trump	According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.
0176	SYSTEM	[Fact check This needs context.]
0177	Donald Trump	Switching away from this current system of lowerskilled immigration, and instead adopting a meritbased system, we will have so many more benefits.
0178	Donald Trump	It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class.
0179	Donald Trump	And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.
0180	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0181	Donald Trump	I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security and to restore respect for our laws.
0182	Donald Trump	If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
0183	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0184	Donald Trump	Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program the building of the interstate highway system.
0185	Donald Trump	The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.
0186	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0187	Donald Trump	America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.
0188	Donald Trump	With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.
0189	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0190	Donald Trump	To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.
0191	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0192	Donald Trump	This effort will be guided by two core principles Buy American and hire American.
0193	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0194	Donald Trump	Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare...
0195	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0196	Donald Trump	... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care.
0197	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0198	Donald Trump	Mandating every American to buy governmentapproved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.
0199	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0200	Donald Trump	The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do.
0201	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0202	Donald Trump	Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.
0203	SYSTEM	[Fact check True, but cherrypicked.]
0204	Donald Trump	As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.
0205	Donald Trump	Gov.
0206	Donald Trump	Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the state of Kentucky, and it's unsustainable and collapsing.
0207	Donald Trump	One third of the counties have only one insurer, and they're losing them fast, they are losing them so fast.
0208	Donald Trump	They're leaving.
0209	Donald Trump	And many Americans have no choice at all.
0210	Donald Trump	There's no choice left.
0211	Donald Trump	Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan?
0212	Donald Trump	We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.
0213	Donald Trump	Obamacare is collapsing
0214	SYSTEM	[Fact check This is an exaggeration. ]
0215	Donald Trump	, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.
0216	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0217	Donald Trump	Action is not a choice it is a necessity.
0218	Donald Trump	So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
0219	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0220	Donald Trump	Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.
0221	Donald Trump	First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.
0222	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0223	Donald Trump	Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.
0224	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0225	Donald Trump	Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.
0226	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0227	Donald Trump	Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.
0228	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0229	Donald Trump	And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines...
0230	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0231	Donald Trump	... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.
0232	Donald Trump	So important.
0233	Donald Trump	Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.
0234	Donald Trump	Every problem can be solved.
0235	Donald Trump	And every hurting family can find healing and hope.
0236	Donald Trump	Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?
0237	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0238	Donald Trump	On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.
0239	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0240	Donald Trump	My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave...

0243	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0244	Donald Trump	True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.
0245	Donald Trump	An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.
0246	Donald Trump	Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan...
0247	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0248	Donald Trump	Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.
0249	Donald Trump	She was not expected to live past 5.
0250	Donald Trump	On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.
0251	Donald Trump	He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life.
0252	Donald Trump	Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.
0253	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0254	Donald Trump	Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.
0255	Donald Trump	But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.
0256	Donald Trump	If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A.
0257	Donald Trump	but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.
0258	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0259	Donald Trump	In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.
0260	Donald Trump	But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind  and the souls  of every American child.

0262	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0263	Donald Trump	I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of AfricanAmerican and Latino children.

0270	Donald Trump	Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.
0271	Donald Trump	Later this year, she will get her master's degree in social work.
0272	Donald Trump	We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.
0273	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0274	Donald Trump	But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.
0275	Donald Trump	The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest singleyear increase in nearly half a century.
0276	SYSTEM	[Fact check True, but somewhat misleading.]
0277	Donald Trump	In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.

0286	Donald Trump	We have to unify.
0287	Donald Trump	Police and sheriffs are members of our community.
0288	Donald Trump	They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.
0289	Donald Trump	We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
0290	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0291	Donald Trump	And we must support the victims of crime.
0292	Donald Trump	I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.

0319	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0320	Donald Trump	I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...
0321	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0322	Donald Trump	... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
0323	Donald Trump	My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.
0324	Donald Trump	Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.
0325	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0326	Donald Trump	The challenges we face as a nation are great.
0327	Donald Trump	But our people are even greater.

0329	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0330	Donald Trump	We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William "Ryan" Owens.

0341	Donald Trump	And he's very happy, because I think he just broke a record.
0342	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0343	Donald Trump	For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.
0344	Donald Trump	Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom.
0345	Donald Trump	And we will never forget Ryan.
0346	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0347	Donald Trump	To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.
0348	Donald Trump	Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.
0349	Donald Trump	It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism...
0350	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0351	Donald Trump	... and a Cold War and defeated communism.
0352	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0353	Donald Trump	But our partners must meet their financial obligations.
0354	Donald Trump	And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.
0355	Donald Trump	In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in.
0356	Donald Trump	Very nice.
0357	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0358	Donald Trump	We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost  have to do that.
0359	Donald Trump	We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations.
0360	Donald Trump	And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.
0361	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0362	Donald Trump	Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.
0363	Donald Trump	My job is not to represent the world.
0364	Donald Trump	My job is to represent the United States of America.
0365	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0366	Donald Trump	But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.
0367	Donald Trump	We must learn from the mistakes of the past.
0368	Donald Trump	We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world.
0369	Donald Trump	All across the world.
0370	Donald Trump	The only longterm solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.
0371	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0372	Donald Trump	America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.
0373	Donald Trump	We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.
0374	Donald Trump	We want peace, wherever peace can be found.
0375	Donald Trump	America is friends today with former enemies.
0376	Donald Trump	Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.
0377	Donald Trump	This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.
0378	Donald Trump	Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.
0379	Donald Trump	On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial.
0380	Donald Trump	At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations.
0381	Donald Trump	Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.
0382	Donald Trump	Remington unveiled the first typewriter.
0383	Donald Trump	An early attempt was made at electric light.
0384	Donald Trump	Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.
0385	Donald Trump	Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.
0386	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0387	Donald Trump	Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.
0388	Donald Trump	Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.
0389	Donald Trump	American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.
0390	Donald Trump	Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.
0391	Donald Trump	And streets where mothers are safe from fear  schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow  are not too much to ask.
0392	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0393	Donald Trump	When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans.
0394	Donald Trump	This is our vision.
0395	Donald Trump	This is our mission.
0396	Donald Trump	But we can only get there together.
0397	Donald Trump	We are one people, with one destiny.
0398	Donald Trump	We all bleed the same blood.
0399	Donald Trump	We all salute the same great American flag.
0400	Donald Trump	And we are all made by the same God.
0401	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0402	Donald Trump	When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began.
0403	Donald Trump	The time for small thinking is over.
0404	Donald Trump	The time for trivial fights is behind us.
0405	Donald Trump	We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.
0406	Donald Trump	From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.
0407	Donald Trump	I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
0408	Donald Trump	I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.
0409	Donald Trump	I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.
0410	Donald Trump	Believe in yourselves.
0411	Donald Trump	Believe in your future.
0412	Donald Trump	And believe, once more, in America.
0413	Donald Trump	Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.
