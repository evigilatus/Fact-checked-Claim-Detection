As for fossils, his campaign insisted that there were no such purchases -- he said that she only bought books and maps from businesses that also happened to sell fossils. The critics made the wrong assumption. Coulperson's campaign initially told us. We're going to look at two parts of the claim, but we're going to give up a little bit of what we found here: he bought fossil replicas. If you were wondering why an environmental group was interested in fossils and Coulperson, the group noted that, late in the summer, Colperson said that his purchases were for research into things such as climate science, or climate study before effective records were widely available, to help him better understand climate change. The Environmental Defense Fund states that for all of this study, Colberson still refuses to accept scientific research on this issue. Colberson said that humans played a role in climate change but, as he told the Los Angeles Times in 2015, \"we just don't have enough data or accurate data to say with confidence what that effect was.\" Let's take the drills first. The Congressional critics based their claim on a report in the 2012 campaign funding report that the Colberson campaign carried out two purchases from the South Dakota Organization, Black Hills Geological Research Institute. The Institute sells fossils, copies, and other things, and Coulberson spent $309.66 right there. The purchase was part of a broader set of Colberson expenditures that Texas Democrats questioned -- a set of questions that we are not fully addressing here because we are looking specifically at campaign announcements and demands. But from a point of view, the Houston Chronicle wrote in August that Democrats in Texas have been challenging nearly $50,000 in the Colberson campaign since 2004. When Paulette Fuckett focused on the excavations, she asked about the Colperson campaign she had purchased from the Black Hills Institute. We were told that she bought books and maps, not fossils, the same explanation the campaign has given since August. \"Only in politics, no one is attacked for trying to be better at his job,\" said the spokesman for the Colberson Cathrin Kelly campaign. \"The correspondence from the Environmental Defense Fund is factually false. Congressman never bought fossils with campaign donations, and all other purchases are accepted under House and F.E.C. laws. Culperson is a nehemian reader, and he spent thousands of dollars on his campaign account for books and materials, including some on climatology, which says his campaign was linked to his work. In the 2011-12 campaign season only, the Colpserson campaign spent $9,848 on \"research\" or \"research materials,\" mostly from vendors such as Amazon.com and Barns & Nobel, the FEC records reviewed by Polyte Fact. The Subcommittee of Accreditations of the Chamber of Deputies, which oversees expenditure on science and agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is chaired by Colberson. The research material helps him to understand the changing levels of carbon dioxide in the climate, as his campaign says. When asked about records showing that he was buying books and maps, not fossils, from the Black Hills Institute, his campaign said that the 2012 records of such specific purchases no longer existed. However, we have received the receipts \"Polit Fact\" called the Black Hills Institute. They pulled the bills from Coulperson's separate orders and sent us copies. This is what the campaign paid for, with the exception of shipping charges: three large wall charts showing a large history of land and material, dating back to 4.5 billion years. The maps contain columns showing tectonic maps, land changes such as mountain formation, major volcanic eruptions, ice periods, excavations of asteroids and comets, extensive information on fossils, invertebrates and vertebrates, as well as their extinction. That's $19.95 per piece. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" It cost $84.05. Two large - 4.5 inches - two fossilized versions of age (Tyrannosaurus Rex). Each cost $40. The Federal Election Commission gave us a \"very broad offer\" to purchase books and other materials that the candidate or incumbent may use in his official capacity, Brendan Fisher, an expert in the Electoral Campaign Financing Act at the Electoral Campaign Legal Center, told us so. But what about the Triceratops model and the replicas of Tyrannosaurus Rex's dental digs? He said, \"I'd like to hear their explanation.\" \"It is difficult to see what this has to do with their official duties.\" The campaign told us what we found and asked for our evidence. So we sent the campaign the congressman's purchase bills. \"The bill confirms that Congressman never bought real fossils, and every purchase from the Black Hills Institute is acceptable under the rules of the house and the FEC.\" I asked why Congressman bought the copycat and model at all, Kelly said, \"while these purchases were more than six years ago and are now used as part of a coordinated party killing, Congressman believes that these private purchases were gifts, which is perfectly acceptable under the rules of the Federal Election Commission and the House of Representatives.\" The mailman from the Environmental Defense Fund also referred to the use of Culperson's campaign funds for the purchase of acquisitions and souvenirs in the civil war. This also resulted from the complaint of Democrats referred to in the Houston Chronicle. Culperson is the history of civil war, collectors, and sometime a souvenir salesman. But when it came to his campaign money, the purchases for items such as stamps and coins that Congressman got for surrender as gifts, she said his campaign. Members of Congress often use campaign money to buy gifts for voters and volunteers, and the Colberson campaign said that the Republicans in Texas do nothing different than the Democratic Leader of House Nancy Belusi when buying white orchids. Fischer said that the Federal Election Commission allowed candidates and office holders to purchase and give gifts of nominal value as long as they were not given to family members. The reports of the Federal Electoral Commission show only what the candidate or incumbent pays, not the value of each element. For example, in 2014, the Colberson campaign spent $631.3 on coins from an old coin seller. In 2009 and 2010, the campaign spent US$ 4,181 on artifacts and coins for gifts, including hat stars (soldier's hat logo) and Texas centenary and coins of the Republic of Texas, showing the records of the Federal Election Commission. According to the Culperson campaign, the value of each coin is about $25, and the value of stamps is about $10. From a broader point of view, we downloaded FEC data showing all federal candidates' purchases -- that's for everyone with a federal campaign account -- from items listed as \"gifts\" since January 2017. The total amount was $1.8 million, for each model aircraft to be a balcony to the gift baskets. Our ruling environmental defense fund said that John Colberson of the Republic of Texas was arrested using campaign funds on acquisitions, including civil war souvenirs and fossils. The science seemed strong at first, given the denial of the campaign. But with a phone call and an e-mail, it turns out that Colberson actually used campaign money -- not for fossils, but for copying and the desktop model. Our judgment comes to perspective. The circulation of mail seemed a little strong at first, especially knowing that the purchase of gifts, whether for the sake of civil war solutions or not, was allowed if it was considered of nominal value. But the campaign's insistence that Colberson didn't buy fossils -- and that he only bought books and maps -- is also a factor. Well, he didn't buy fossils. He bought replicas of fossils. We're mostly assessing the claim right. Sharing the facts of 2018-11-03 18:15:50 UTC PoliticsFact 5 1 7 PoliticFact Drafting: Most of them true.
