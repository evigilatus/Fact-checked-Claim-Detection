When ABC managers pressured the real estate sector to obtain details of how it was boosting the economy, Trump said that he wanted to reduce taxes for middle class and business. On February 6, 2016, Trump said: \"Now we are the world's highest tax country.\" The Trump campaign did not respond to us, but his claim could have been accurate if it was more specific. We have previously assessed a statement that the United States has the highest tax rate of companies mostly true, because the legal rate of corporate taxes is the highest in the world. However, it should be noted that discounts and exceptions usually reduce the actual rate, making the United States below similar levels for other countries. But Trump didn't exactly say the rate of corporate debate, so we wanted to know how high American taxes were up to the rest of the world. Tax experts have told us that there are usually two ways to compare different countries: tax revenues as a percentage of GDP, and tax revenues per capita. We have examined both through the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), a group of 34 industrialized countries that we can consider to be an economic counterpart. In the OECD data for 2014, the last year available, the United States was far from being the most tax-dependent among this group. Taxes accounted for 26 per cent of GDP, ranked 27 out of 30 countries in America (the OECD average was over 34 per cent). The top five countries as a percentage of GDP were Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France and Italy, all above 43 per cent. Chile, Mexico and Korea were the only countries of lower rank than the United States. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, with regard to per capita tax income, we rise slightly. America is the seventeenth country out of 29 countries under this measure listed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with a total tax of $14,994 per person. The first five countries were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, which ranged from a high of approximately $50,000 to over $23,000. Twelve countries were less than the United States. The per capita tax revenue was less than $3,000 for the lower two, Chile and Turkey. Industrialized economies are the best measure, but United States taxes as a percentage of GDP ranked twelfth against the base if compared to a list of more than 115 countries. :: World Bank data for 2012 -- the last year in which figures were updated -- showed that countries with lower percentages than the United States were members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (Japan and Spain), two oil-rich countries (Kuwait and Oman) and a few poor countries (e.g. Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). The point is, Trump is on the wrong side of the ledger with this claim. Our Governor Trump said, \"Now we are the highest tax country in the world.\" We used some of the different measures suggested by the experts to determine that, regardless of how they are divided, the United States is far from the world &apos; s most tax-prone country, whether it is an advanced industrial economy or not. We're assessing his statement wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0fe57c6b-7f30-4095-bea2-2b7e4a3d9b33", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05450"}
