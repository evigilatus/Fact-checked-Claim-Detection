They concluded that \"the virus remains in lung tissue for many days, even if in small quantities, possibly being the trigger of the mechanism that leads to and feeds lung damage.\"\nTheir findings were posted in a preliminary study April 19. That study has not been peer reviewed, meaning it has not yet been evaluated by experts for formal publication in a medical journal.\u00a0\nOne of the pathologists on the study, Dr. Aurelio Sonzogni of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, confirmed to PolitiFact that the study does not contradict the fact that COVID-19 is a virus that cannot be treated with antibiotics. Rather, his study found that lung damage caused by blood clots is one possible effect of COVID-19. The study has been accepted for publication in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, a London-based medical journal, he said.\nOur ruling\n\"Autopsies prove that COVID-19 is\" a blood clot, not pneumonia, \"and ought to be fought with antibiotics,\" a Facebook post claimed,\" and the whole world has been wrong in treating the \"so-called\" pandemic.\nThe novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 is a virus. Viruses do not respond to antibiotic treatment; antibiotics only work on bacterial infections.\n\nCOVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness that in some cases causes pneumonia. Another effect, according to the autopsies in Italy, is lung damage caused by blood clotting.\nThe post is false and ridiculous \u2014 Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18328"}
