Donald Trump calls it a \"segregated crime scene,\" which he's the only one who can fix. It does not matter to him that illegal migration and the crime rate are as low as they were decades ago, because it does not offer any real solutions to those issues. It only provides slogans, and it offers fear. He bet that if he scares enough people, he may get enough votes to win this election.\" Trump actually named the United States a \"segregated crime scene\" in a tweet. But for this fact-checking, we are going to focus on Obama's claim about illegal migration and crime. There is no reliable account for illegal migration. It is clear that people who come to the United States illegally are trying to avoid detection. The best available indicator is the number of persons arrested by the United States Border Patrol, which is an incomplete measure because some people can be counted twice if arrested twice, for example. These data show a very steady decline to 337,117 cases of fear in fiscal year 2015. In contrast, concerns peaked in 2000, when more than 1.6 million people were registered. To see a lower rate of fear across the country, you have to go back to 44 years, to 1971. (The vast majority of those arrests in 2015 were 98 percent along the south-west border.) Another important warning to note is that the rates do not necessarily equal enforcement, which has become more stringent in recent years. Also, the number of people trying to cross is linked to economic conditions, which are not always under the control of the President. On 29 January 2021, contrary to what Trump has repeatedly claimed, the crime rate in the United States has been declining for years. There were some preliminary data from early 2015 and partial comparisons late in early 2016 indicating an increase, but the overall trend up to 2014 of the annual data collected by the FBI - using reports from local law enforcement agencies - The trend towards property offences is similar. In addition, the annual statistics compiled by the Ministry of Justice for the National Crime Victim Survey show the same trends. Our Governor Obama said, \"Irregular migration and crime rates are as low as they were decades ago.\" The data generally support his claim, but the numbers aren't perfect. There is a hint of a recent rise in crime based on partial and principled data from 2015 and 2016, and estimates of illegal immigration must depend on arrests by border patrols because it is impossible to calculate the number of people who infiltrate directly into the United States. With these cautious words in mind, we often appreciate Obama's claim. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7b8d1f60-5715-4cd5-9bf2-999919183a31", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04582"}
