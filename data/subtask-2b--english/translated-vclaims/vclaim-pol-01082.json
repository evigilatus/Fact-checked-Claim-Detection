The budget of Ralph Northam's plan will raise taxes.", "text": "The minority leader Ellen Feller Corne, De Fairfax, recently accused a Republican legislator of publishing \"mistake information\" about Gove. The proposed State budget for Ralph Northham. She said: \"There is no tax increase in the Governor's plan,\" in a speech on the 15th floor of January, contesting the counter-claim from Del. Tim Hugo, R. Fairfax. \"And yet, the Commonwealth is responding to actions, once again, by the Trump administration, which, too, is clearly at the dawn of the deficit.\" Didn't Northam, Feller Corns' democratic colleague, propose to raise taxes? Let's take a look. The story begins in December 2017, when Congress passed under Republican leadership, and President Donald Trump signed comprehensive permanent business tax cuts and temporary household cuts. Among its provisions, the Act provides an incentive for many filers to obtain a new standard deduction from their federal income tax returns rather than classification. The standard discount almost doubled, from $12,700 to $24,000 for spouses and from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals. On the other hand, the law reduced the popular split discounts of interest on mortgages, and government and local taxes paid. Reductions in transport expenditures have been eliminated. This sets out federal income tax rules outside the laws of Virginia, which set the standard discount well below $3,000 for single applicants and $600 for married couples who apply jointly. Virginia also requires all filings who have classified their United States income tax data to follow suit with respect to United States revenues, and also requires those who take the federal standard discount to also take the Virginia standard discount. As a result, it is estimated that 26 per cent of Virginia's filers - or 600,000 filers - may lose some of the benefits of reducing federal taxes by not being able to classify them in Virginia and seeing their income tax bills rise. The average increase will amount to $392 in revenue this year, according to the Northham study commissioned last summer by Steinbridge Software, LLC in Fairfax County. The bridge chain estimates that federal tax changes will create an unexpected gain for the state government of $1.2 billion over the next two years of the budget, starting on July 1, 2019. How to use that money has become a major discussion. Northam and many democratic legislators would like to use $216 million to grant the State a tax income exemption for low-income households and to spend the rest on various initiatives, including raising teachers &apos; salaries and assisting local economic development. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 Warren Fiskeh, on 20 January 2021, states that the Northam proposal is not a starting point. Many say that this will unfairly transfer wealth from middle-class families to low-income families. Lawmakers press a plan that would allow Virginia to classify their income taxes even if they took the standard discount from their federal earnings. This would allow for a fair return of the unexpected profit of taxpayers, as they say. We have asked the office of Feller Corn to explain her claim that the Northam budget does not raise taxes. Adam Zuckerman, Senior Adviser, responded by e-mail. He wrote: \"The Delgate Fuller Corn statement on the floor of the House of Representatives that there is no tax increase in the Governor's proposed budget is correct. Any tax change currently affecting the citizens of Virgin Islands is the result of actions taken at the federal level last year. The current debate in the General Assembly is about how Virginia will respond to those federal procedures and use any excess revenue generated.\" \"There is no tax increase in the Governor's budget plan.\" Any increase in state income tax bills, her chief adviser says, the waves of federal tax reform passed in 2017, not the government. Northam's proposals. Because of these changes, the income tax laws of Virginia deviated from the laws of the U.S. government. The Northam plan would keep the inequality the same and, as a result, 26 per cent of the filings in Virginia would see an increase in government income tax bills - an average of $392. This would create $1.2 billion in windfall gains for the State over two years, and Northam proposes to spend most of that. The Feller Corn explanation indicates that the Governor's hands are tied. But Northham had options. He could have recommended bringing Virginia &apos; s laws closer to the Federal Tax Code, thereby ending the opportunity for any Virginia to pay a higher income tax. The Governor chose otherwise. As we have noted, it will not be a large-scale tax raise; it will affect one of four filings from Virginia. That helps Feller Corn a little bit. We assess her statement mostly wrong.
