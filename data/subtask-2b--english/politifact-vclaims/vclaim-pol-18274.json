Pritzker has come to pull it out.\"\nThe National Governors Association sent a bipartisan letter to Congress in April that made clear the financial pressure caused by COVID-19 is being felt by states nationwide, not just in blue states as Trump has said.\nBut what about Pelosi\u2019s assessment of how Illinois got itself into a financial bind?\nHer comment suggests Illinois\u2019 hardships are a matter of recent history, dating back just a few years to the time of Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s Republican predecessor. State finance experts say that\u2019s misleading.\nRauner\u2019s role\nUnderstanding what Pelosi was referencing requires a brief detour into recent state history.\nIn November 2014, Illinoisans elected Republican Bruce Rauner as governor. Rauner, a private equity investor and political newcomer, reached an impasse with Democrats who control the legislature over how to run the state. This left Illinois without a spending plan for two years.\nWith government spending left operating largely on autopilot, social services suffered, public universities laid off thousands of employees and the state\u2019s pile of unpaid bills tripled, causing credit rating agencies to reduce Illinois\u2019 rating to near-junk status.\nAs the state\u2019s chief executive, Rauner played a starring role in the showdown that caused the budget crisis. But he had plenty of co-stars among the state\u2019s leading Democrats, including longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan, who has exerted influence over every state budget for the past four decades.\nDemocratic leadership also allowed a temporary state income tax increase to expire days before Rauner was sworn into office in 2015, leaving the state with even less cash to make ends meet during the crisis. Rauner had urged the legislature to let it lapse before taking office, and Madigan along with then Senate President John Cullerton obliged despite warnings from then Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, who lost to Rauner in 2014.\nA legacy of fiscal mismanagement\nFoisting all the blame for the state\u2019s unprecedented budget crisis on Rauner isn\u2019t the only problem with Pelosi\u2019s narrative. That\u2019s because the tale of how Illinois dug itself into a fiscal hole dates back much further than his single term in office.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we raised this with Pelosi\u2019s office, a spokesman responded with an email saying she was \"clearly referencing the fact that Illinois\u2019 situation greatly worsened\" under Rauner \u2014 not that he alone was responsible for the state\u2019s fiscal woes.\nBut experts interpreted her statement differently.\n\"To claim that this is a problem created by Gov. Rauner is clearly misleading,\" said David Merriman, an economist who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois\u2019 Institute of Government & Public Affairs. \"It's a problem that's developed over decades.\"\nIllinois governors and lawmakers from both parties have long managed to increase government spending without raising the revenue needed to support it.\n\"For many, many years we\u2019ve provided more goods and services \u2026 than our revenues would support,\" said Charles N. Wheeler III, who has studied decades of state budgets as both a journalist and professor at the University of Illinois Springfield. \"It\u2019s always easier for lawmakers to fund programs than it is to raise the revenues to cover it.\"\nIndeed, the alarm bells began sounding long before Rauner took office. A 2011 report from the state comptroller\u2019s office warned of a looming financial crisis created by many years of rampant spending. The report cautioned that the recession at the time had exacerbated the state\u2019s ongoing failures to reduce its debt, build up its emergency reserves, or contribute enough to state employee pension funds.\nAnd when it comes to pensions, Illinois\u2019 problems date back even further. In 1917, a report commissioned by the General Assembly was already warning the funds were \"moving toward crisis\" due to inadequate payments from the state.\n\"We\u2019ve been shortchanging the pensions for more than a hundred years,\" Wheeler said.\nOur ruling\nPelosi said Illinois \"got into fiscal problems because of a Republican governor who was governor there\" before Pritzker.\nIllinois\u2019 financial situation did worsen during Rauner's term while the state operated without a spending plan for an unprecedented two years, but he wasn\u2019t solely to blame. What\u2019s more, the state was already teetering on the brink when he took office because of decisions made by leaders from both parties dating back decades.\nWe rate Pelosi\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18274"}
