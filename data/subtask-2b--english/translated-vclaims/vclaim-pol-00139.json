In a speech delivered on 4 September at the National Press Club in Washington, the Federation President, Cecil E. Roberts, replaced the number of coal-fired power plants being built internationally. Roberts said: \"We need to develop technology to remove carbon from coal burning, or you will not -- write this word -- never solve climate change. Never. Why? There are 1600 -- 1600 -- new coal-fired power plants being built as I speak around the world.\" That's a lot. Is that right? We've had a good look. (The union did not respond to requests for suspension.) We found the New York Times article published on July 1, 2017, which says, \"In general, 1,600 coal stations are planned or under construction in 62 countries.\" At the very least, the figure of 1,600 may be old, as it is over two years old. So we took a closer look at the sources. The article attributed this data to the Global Coal Plant Tracking System, a portal published by GEM. Founded in 2007, this group includes board members from environmental groups such as Action for Clean Energy, Green Peace and Rainforest Action Network. (The Panel has not responded to a query on this article.) As has been shown, the number on the site today is lower. The tracking device lists coal-fired units as one of the following categories: declared, cancelled, under construction, occupied, operational, permitted, pre-licensed, retired and encrypted. We looked at the figures using a few of these groups. According to the tracking device, 458 units - well below 1,600 Roberts units - are currently under construction. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. \u2022 29 January 2021, screen capture shows 458 coal units with site preparation and other ongoing activities. If added at the authorized or pre-licensing stage, the number will increase to 903. This figure includes factories seeking environmental approvals and other development steps, according to the global environmental management website. The pick-up of the screen shows that 903 coal-fired units with licences and pre-licence are still under construction. Even if you add in those that are \"publicized\" -- which are not really \"under construction\" -- it only raises the number to 1,160. This is more than a quarter below the number that Roberts mentioned. (There are none in the United States.) Kelly Simms Gallagher, Director of the Climate Policy Laboratory at the University of Tufts, Polyte Fact, reported that other data sources indicated a low interest in coal-fired power plants. The International Energy Agency (IEA), an international organization based in Paris, found that the final decisions to invest in new coal power plants had declined steadily between 2015 and 2018. Gallagher said this separate source of \"Frances\" data questions about Roberts' basic argument -- that the coal power plant sector is healthy. Finally, a technical point: Tracking uses the term \"units,\" while Roberts refers to \"plants.\" A worldwide survey of coal-fired power plants shows that these plants often include several units. Our referee Roberts said, \"There are 1,600 new coal power plants being built as I speak around the world.\" An article in The New York Times more than two years ago mentioned 1,600, but even then described the units that were being \"planed or under construction\" - and were not being strictly constructed. In addition, these figures appear to have shrunk in the following two years. Using the same site used by the Times, there are 458 coal units built around the world today, and 903 if they are included in the pre-emission or permit phase - much less than Roberts indicated. We're mostly assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00139"}
