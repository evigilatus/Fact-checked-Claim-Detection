0001	TRUMP	Today I'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.
0002	TRUMP	People have asked me why I am running for President.
0003	TRUMP	I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work sidebyside with my children every day.
0004	TRUMP	We come to work together and turn visions into reality.
0005	TRUMP	We think big, and then we make it happen.
0006	TRUMP	I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.
0007	TRUMP	So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.
0008	TRUMP	When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton  only by me.
0009	TRUMP	The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before Jobs, jobs, jobs!
0010	TRUMP	Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be.
0011	TRUMP	But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.
0012	TRUMP	We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.
0013	TRUMP	The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.
0014	TRUMP	That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans.
0015	TRUMP	Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.
0016	TRUMP	Because it's not just the political system that's rigged.
0017	TRUMP	It's the whole economy.
0018	TRUMP	It's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.
0019	TRUMP	It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.
0020	TRUMP	It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.
0021	TRUMP	It's rigged against you, the American people.
0022	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar  just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total selfserving lie.
0023	TRUMP	Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.
0024	TRUMP	Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses.
0025	TRUMP	But here is the bottom line I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars.
0026	TRUMP	I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs.
0027	TRUMP	That is a talent our country desperately needs.
0028	TRUMP	I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.
0029	TRUMP	We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.
0030	TRUMP	This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.
0031	TRUMP	Here is my promise to the American voter   If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.
0032	TRUMP	The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests  and taking money from special interests.
0033	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.
0034	TRUMP	She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund  doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.
0035	TRUMP	Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests  in less than 2 years  secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.
0036	TRUMP	Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.
0037	TRUMP	They totally own her, and that will never change.
0038	TRUMP	The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.
0039	TRUMP	Those are the stakes.
0040	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton wants to be President.
0041	TRUMP	But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.
0042	TRUMP	She believes she is entitled to the office.
0043	TRUMP	Her campaign slogan is "I'm with her."
0044	TRUMP	You know what my response to that is?
0045	TRUMP	I'm with you the American people.
0046	TRUMP	She thinks it's all about her.
0047	TRUMP	I know it's all about you  I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.
0048	TRUMP	Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.
0049	TRUMP	We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism  focusing on what's good for America's middle class  to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.
0050	TRUMP	We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.
0051	TRUMP	This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.
0052	TRUMP	This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.
0053	TRUMP	We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.
0054	TRUMP	That's what we mean by America First.
0055	TRUMP	Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.
0056	TRUMP	Our Founders understood this. One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for "the encouragement and protection of manufactur
0057	SYSTEM	[ing]
0058	TRUMP	in America.
0059	TRUMP	Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying   The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."
0060	TRUMP	I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
0061	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.
0062	TRUMP	We've lost nearly onethird of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillarybacked agreements were signed.
0063	TRUMP	Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State  a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.
0064	TRUMP	Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property  a crime which is continuing to this day.
0065	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.
0066	TRUMP	In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!
0067	TRUMP	The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.
0068	TRUMP	She gets rich making you poor.
0069	TRUMP	Here is a quote from the book "At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clintonat this critical time for USchina relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters."
0070	TRUMP	These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.
0071	TRUMP	She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.
0072	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the TransPacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas  and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.
0073	TRUMP	Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.
0074	TRUMP	She has even deleted this record of total support from her book  deletion is something she is very good at  (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)
0075	TRUMP	But this latest Clinton coverup doesn't change anything if she is elected president, she will adopt the TransPacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good.
0076	TRUMP	She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career  and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.
0077	TRUMP	I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.
0078	TRUMP	We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.
0079	TRUMP	It's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.
0080	TRUMP	The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars  and unleashed ISIS across the world.
0081	TRUMP	No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.
0082	TRUMP	Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.
0083	TRUMP	Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens.
0084	TRUMP	He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed  that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.
0085	TRUMP	Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.
0086	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.
0087	TRUMP	She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.
0088	TRUMP	To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.
0089	TRUMP	Here is what one of the victim's mothers had to say   "I want the whole world to know it she lied to my face, and you don't want this person to be president."
0090	TRUMP	In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.
0091	TRUMP	Libya was cooperating.
0092	TRUMP	Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.
0093	TRUMP	Syria was under control.
0094	TRUMP	Iran was being choked by sanctions.
0095	TRUMP	Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.
0096	TRUMP	ISIS wasn't even on the map.
0097	TRUMP	Fast forward to 2013 In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed   to almost singlehandedly destabilize the entire Middle East.
0098	TRUMP	Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.
0099	TRUMP	Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.
0100	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen  while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.
0101	TRUMP	She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood.
0102	TRUMP	The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam.
0103	TRUMP	Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.
0104	TRUMP	ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.
0105	TRUMP	ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality  and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.
0106	TRUMP	In short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.
0107	TRUMP	It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.
0108	TRUMP	Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.
0109	TRUMP	But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya.
0110	TRUMP	She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.
0111	TRUMP	In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office   "She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the officefrom the bottom of my soul, I know this to be trueHer leadership style  volcanic, impulsivedisdainful of the rules set for everyone else  hasn't changed a bit."
0112	TRUMP	Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.
0113	TRUMP	In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.
0114	TRUMP	Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth  with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.
0115	TRUMP	Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.
0116	TRUMP	The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive antigay and antiwomen regimes on Earth.
0117	TRUMP	I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.
0118	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.
0119	TRUMP	Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.
0120	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.
0121	TRUMP	Here is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash   A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes.
0122	TRUMP	So what did this company do?
0123	TRUMP	For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech.
0124	TRUMP	The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.
0125	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.
0126	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access  even though he had no national security credentials.
0127	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State  plus millions more for her foundation.
0128	TRUMP	The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.
0129	TRUMP	The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's TransPacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance.
0130	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.
0131	TRUMP	Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.
0132	TRUMP	To coverup her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.
0133	TRUMP	Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments  perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China  putting all of America in danger.
0134	TRUMP	Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.
0135	TRUMP	While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.
0136	TRUMP	So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.
0137	TRUMP	This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.
0138	TRUMP	We can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.
0139	TRUMP	National security is also immigration security  and Hillary wants neither.
0140	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.
0141	TRUMP	She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.
0142	TRUMP	The first victims of her radical policies will be poor AfricanAmerican and Hispanic workers who need jobs.
0143	TRUMP	They are the ones she will hurt the most.
0144	TRUMP	Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.
0145	TRUMP	She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.
0146	TRUMP	Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.
0147	TRUMP	Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter   "Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms' way  an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country.
0148	TRUMP	Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her.
0149	TRUMP	She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country."
0150	TRUMP	Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.
0151	TRUMP	For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.
0152	TRUMP	Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work.
0153	TRUMP	She can't claim to care about AfricanAmerican and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new lowwage workers to compete against them.
0154	TRUMP	Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days   Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution.
0155	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.
0156	TRUMP	Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill goodpaying jobs   Stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many   Cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas   Lift restrictions on energy production   Repeal and replace jobkilling Obamacare  it is a disaster.
0157	TRUMP	Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.
0158	TRUMP	Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.
0159	TRUMP	There is one common theme in all of these reforms.
0160	TRUMP	It's going to be America First.
0161	TRUMP	This is why the stakes in November are so great.
0162	TRUMP	On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.
0163	TRUMP	The voters are the jury.
0164	TRUMP	Their ballots are the verdict.
0165	TRUMP	We don't need or want another Clinton or Obama.
0166	TRUMP	Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.
0167	TRUMP	They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.
0168	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton's message is old and tired.
0169	TRUMP	Her message is that can't change.
0170	TRUMP	My message is that things have to change  and this is our one chance do it.
0171	TRUMP	This is our last chance to do it.
0172	TRUMP	Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.
0173	TRUMP	Then we started thinking small.
0174	TRUMP	We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.
0175	TRUMP	We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.
0176	TRUMP	But that's not who we are.
0177	TRUMP	Come this November, we can bring America back  bigger and better, and stronger than ever.
0178	TRUMP	We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth  the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.
0179	TRUMP	Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment  we will bring it back all the way.
0180	TRUMP	Massive new factories will come roaring into our country  breathing life and hope into our communities.
0181	TRUMP	Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.
0182	TRUMP	Construction is what I know  nobody knows it better.
0183	TRUMP	The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years  but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs.
0184	TRUMP	Hillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.
0185	TRUMP	We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement  we can never forget the great job they do.
0186	TRUMP	I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.
0187	TRUMP	Our country is going to start working again.
0188	TRUMP	People are going to start working again.
0189	TRUMP	Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again  including parents in our inner cities.
0190	TRUMP	Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.
0191	TRUMP	We are going to make America rich again.
0192	TRUMP	We are going to make America safe again.
0193	TRUMP	We are going to make America Great Again  and Great Again For EVERYONE.
