Mitch McConnell\u2019s proteges for years. Now, social media users are claiming that Cameron\u2019s July 31 marriage made the two family.\n\"Ummm sisters I'm hearing Daniel Cameron married his mentor Mitch McConnell's granddaughter,\" reads the text on a viral Facebook image. Underneath the text, there are engagement photos of Cameron and his fiancee.\u00a0 We have also seen posts saying the woman is McConnell's neice.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nCameron married his second wife on July 31 in a small outdoor ceremony, according to a Louisville Courier Journal report. A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also confirmed for the Courier Journal that McConnell attended the wedding.\nCameron\u2019s office has been tight-lipped when it comes to releasing details of the marriage. Although they confirmed the wedding occurred, they declined to provide any more details about what they described as a \"private event,\" to the Louisville Courier Journal.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Cameron\u2019s new wife is also McConnell\u2019s granddaughter or related at all. A spokesperson for McConnell confirmed that Cameron\u2019s wife was not the senator\u2019s granddaughter, nor was she related to McConnell in any way. The spokesperson also pointed to a tweet from a reporter who has covered McConnell for some time.\nPhillip M. Bailey, a Kentucky-based political reporter, debunked the post\u2019s claim in a tweet at the end of July before the couple was married but after they were engaged.\n\"I'll say this once and only once because this is so not the issue at hand, but is becoming somewhat of an actual distraction for some folks on the left who either keep asking or telling me. @DanielCameronAG is NOT engaged to @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell's granddaughter,\" he tweeted.\nMcConnell attended Cameron\u2019s wedding, but there is no evidence he was related to the bride as the post suggests.\nWe rate this claim False.\nUpdate (Sept. 25, 2020): This post has been updated to also refute claims that Cameron married McConnell's niece. The rating is unchanged.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19014"}
