And while today\u2019s chatter may be more about cyber attacks than nukes, we should be safe from airborne weapons\u2014at least according to something a Facebook post claims U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\"We\u2019ll never have to worry about China attacking us!,\" reads the text over a photo of the New York congresswoman that was published on Facebook on March 7. \"They are 12 hours ahead, so we\u2019ll have plenty of time to shoot down their missiles!\"\nOne commenter wondered how \"anyone can really be this dumb?\"\n\"Who is supporting her?\" another commenter said. \"Everytime she opens her mouth, she relieves all doubt.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

First we searched for the quote on Google; there were only a few results. One user shared the quote attributed to Ocasio-Cortez on a Mississippi Gun Owners forum, though without a source, and someone else posted it on Godlike Productions, another internet forum. It also appeared on websites with a Ukrainian web address.\nWe searched Nexis for old news stories with Ocasio-Cortez making the statement and came up empty. We also couldn\u2019t find reports of anyone saying it. \u00a0\nNext, we looked for social media posts and news reports about the congresswoman and Chinese missiles, in case she said something similar to the quote, but we couldn\u2019t find instances of Ocasio-Cortez discussing them.\nIn September, a spokesman for her congressional campaign told FactCheck.org that \"the entire quote was fabricated.\"\n\"She\u2019s never even discussed Chinese missiles. Period,\" spokesman Corbin Trent said. \"Her foreign policy topics have been about peace not war.\"\nWe rate this post as Pants on Fire!\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2019-03-13 16:16:52 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, \"We\u2019ll never have to worry about China attacking us!
