She and her staff simply refused to meet with them.\"\n\n\nThat claim was picked up in an\n\ne-mail\n\nthat circulated in 2001 and has gotten new life since Clinton became a presidential candidate. The e-mail says that \"None other than the Queen herself, Hillary Rotten Clinton ... refused repeated requests to meet with the Gold Star Mothers.\"\n\n\nShirley Jones, the legislative chairman for the group in 2001 and one of the women who stopped by Clinton's office, says the e-mail is wrong. She said she sent Clinton a letter requesting a meeting and has since met with her four times. Clinton even sponsored a bill on behalf of the Gold Star Mothers.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 21, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDemocrats forced our GREAT troops to sleep on the ground of a PARKING garage after dragging them to DC for photo ops!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a mother she was very understanding,\" Jones says. \"I felt she was very supportive \u2014 and I'm a Republican.\"\n\n\nThe Gold Star Mothers Web site says the allegation in the e-mail is incorrect. \"This story passed through several people before being reported by NewsMax on May 26, 2001 and the details were lost ...
