Get any job that teaches you to stay all day, even if you\u2019re having a fight with your girlfriend. I mean, the whole process of making work worthwhile is central,\" the former House speaker said.\n\nGingrich has taken considerable heat over his comments, and in an interview with Fox News on Dec. 6, his Republican rival Mitt Romney highlighted the issue as one on which he and Gingrich differ.\n\n\"Speaker Gingrich has said that we ought to get rid of our child labor laws. That, I think, is a mistake,\" Romney told Fox\u2019s Carl Cameron.\n\nDitching the nation\u2019s child labor laws would be a radical move. We wanted to know if that\u2019s what Gingrich is really proposing.\n\nWhat he said\n\nAt Harvard, a female freshman stood and asked Gingrich what he proposes to do about growing income inequality and declining social mobility in America.\n\nGingrich cited three main factors that have caused the inequality -- the collapse of the housing market, which took much of middle-class America\u2019s wealth with it; a decline in manufacturing jobs, which he blames on government policies; and an education system that fails poor kids while cutting off other pathways out of poverty.\n\n\"Core policies of protecting unionization and bureaucratization against children in the poorest neighborhoods crippling them by putting them in schools that fail has done more to create income inequality in the United States than any other single policy\" he said. \"It is tragic what we do in the poorest neighborhoods entrapping children in, first of all, in child laws which are truly stupid. Okay, you say to somebody, \u2018you shouldn\u2019t go to work before you\u2019re what, 14, 16 years of age. Fine. You\u2019re totally poor. You\u2019re in a school that is failing with a teacher that is failing.\u2019\n\n\"I tried for years to have a very simple model. Most of these schools ought to get rid of the unionized janitors, have one master janitor, and pay local students to take care of the school. The kids would actually do work, they would have cash, they\u2019d have pride in the schools, they\u2019d begin the process of rising.\n\n\"You go out and talk to, as I do regularly, talk to people who are really successful in one generation. They all started their first job between 9 and 14 years of age. They all were either selling newspapers, going door to door, they were doing something. They were washing cars. They all learned how to make money at a very early age. What do we say to poor kids in poor neighborhoods? Don\u2019t do it. Remember all the stuff about don\u2019t get a hamburger-flipping job -- the worst possible advice to give to poor children.\n\n\"Get any job that teaches you to show up on Monday. Get any job that teaches you to stay all day, even if you\u2019re having a fight with your girlfriend. I mean, the whole process of making work worthwhile is central.\"\n\nHis remarks generated a lot of buzz, and Gingrich addressed the issue again at a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa on Dec. 1.\n\n\"You have a very poor neighborhood. You have kids who are required under law to go to school. They have no money. They have no habit of work. What if you paid them part time in the afternoon to sit in the clerical office and greet people as they came in? What if you paid them to work as the assistant librarian? And I'd pay them as early as is reasonable and practical.\"\n\n\"Then we get down to the janitor thing,\" Gingrich continued, in reference to his previous comments. \"(I received) letters written that said janitorial work is really hard and really dangerous and this and that. OK, fine. So what if they became assistant janitors and their job was to mop the floor and clean the bathroom. And you paid them.\"\n\nOn Dec. 6, in a radio interview with host Curtis Sliwa on WNYM-AM 970, Gingrich further clarified what jobs he thinks young kids should and shouldn\u2019t have. \"They could be the person who greets you when you walk in the door,\" Gingrich said, according to POLITICO. \"They could help in the school library. They can help in the kitchen. They can help clean up after lunch.\"\n\n\"Kids shouldn't work in coal mines, kids shouldn't work in heavy industry,\" he said.\n\nWhat the law says\n\nChild labor laws are contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. According to the Department of Labor, the laws \"were enacted to ensure that when young people work, the work is safe and does not jeopardize their health, well-being or educational opportunities. These provisions also provide limited exemptions.\"\n\nThe law establishes that minors be paid minimum wage, sets hours that 14- and 15-year-olds can work (i.e., not after 7 p.m. except in the summer) and prohibits youths from working in places like mines, factories or boiler and engine rooms. They are permitted to do office work, kitchen cleaning, cashiering, bagging and customer carry-out. (Our favorite exemption: \"the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens.\")\n\nBased on Gingrich's remarks, he doesn't appear to have any desire to do away with the law's provisions banning youngsters from dangerous workplaces. His argument, instead, seems to be with restrictions on younger children working.\n\nGingrich\u2019s side\n\nR.C. Hammond, Gingrich\u2019s campaign spokesman, said the point of Gingrich\u2019s idea is \"to instill a work ethic in every youngster.\"\n\n\"To help you start off on the right foot and be successful in life, it\u2019s helpful to start work early,\" Hammond said. \"The point that Newt was making is that public schools should make opportunities to go to work. It could be anything, and it\u2019s pretty much on par with whatever your first summer job was.\"\n\n(Hammond\u2019s first job: camp counselor. Gingrich's, in Stuttgart, Germany, where his father was serving in the Army, was at a bowling alley that didn\u2019t have an automatic pin replacer. \"They hired Newt to go and replace the pins that had been knocked down,\" Hammond told us.)\n\nSo was Romney correct that Gingrich wants to do away with the existing law?\n\n\"Any characterization that doesn\u2019t encompass what we just discussed is inaccurate,\" Hammond said.\n\nOther perspectives\n\nJeffrey Miron, a Harvard University economics lecturer and senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said he thought saying Gingrich wants to get rid of the law \"seems a little broad brushed and overly strong. It would be a weakening of child labor laws.\" But that might not be all bad, he said.\n\n\"For some families it would be nice if another $10 or $20 a week came in, and I think that parents are better at making those decisions than a blanket rule,\" he said. \"Why should it be the government\u2019s business?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe talked to other experts on child labor who said that the changes to the law Gingrich has talked about probably would do more harm than good.\n\nEric Edmonds, a Dartmouth College economics professor and author of the book Child Labor and the Transition Between School and Work, recently wrote about Gingrich\u2019s take on child labor.\n\n\"The issue is that workers that start unskilled stay unskilled. Especially if their education is suffering as a result. Working children do not learn skills that are going to help them to succeed in today\u2019s technologically advanced global economy. How is learning to be an unskilled laborer at an early age going to help families in the long-run?\" Edmonds wrote. \"It is not ... We\u2019ve seen what happens when successive generations of families need their children to work. They are unable to escape poverty.\"\n\nHugh Hindman, a professor of Labor & Human Resources at Appalachian State University, said Gingrich is not the first leader to recommend child labor as an anti-poverty program, but that it doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\"It has never worked to alleviate poverty, except in the very short-term, and it exacerbates poverty in the longer term. There is a phenomenon known as the \u2018child labor trap\u2019 \u2026 very poor parents send their children to work as household survival strategy. Consequently the children forfeit schooling and fail to acquire the human capital that would qualify them for anything other than low-wage work as adults. These become the very poor parents of the next generation who send their children to work as household survival strategy. And on again into the next generation,\" Hindman said.\n\nHe added that jobs such as babysitting that Gingrich mentioned are beneficial for young people, but the opportunity to do them are \"skewed in favor of middle and upper-middle class children.\"\n\n\"If Mr. Gingrich could find a way to provide more poor children with these sorts of opportunities, he might well do some good,\" Hindman said.\n\n\"There\u2019s not a golf course (in their neighborhoods),\" said Harvard's Miron, \"but there\u2019s a grocery store down the street that needs boxes stacked or the sidewalk swept.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney said, \"Speaker Gingrich has said that we ought to get rid of our child labor laws.\"\n\nWe found that Gingrich has proposed some unconventional changes to child labor legislation, which he called \"truly stupid.\" Specifically, he said that kids younger than 14 growing up in poverty should be allowed to work as a means of elevating themselves. But he also clarified that children shouldn\u2019t hold mining or industrial jobs.\n\nWhile Gingrich appears to be in favor of easing age restrictions on working, he has given no indication that he wants to \"get rid of\" many other provisions, such as those that prohibit kids from working in certain dangerous occupations.
