But sometimes users play loose with the facts to land their punchline.\nThat\u2019s what happened in an image posted on Facebook in April 2019, which features a long-winded set-up for a joke that casts several prominent Democratic politicians as the descendants of aliens and livestock.\nThe image in the post recalls the tale of a purported UFO crash and alien landing during the summer of 1947 \"on a sheep and mule ranch\" near Roswell, New Mexico, and refers to longstanding theories that the U.S. Air Force and other federal agencies tried to bury the incident.\nThen it pivots to this contention:\u00a0\n\"However, what you may NOT know is that in the month of April 1948, nine months after that historic day, the following people were born:\n\nAlbert A. Gore, Jr.\u00a0\nHillary Rodham\nJohn F. Kerry\nWilliam J. Clinton\nHoward Dean\nNancy Pelosi\nDianne Feinstein\u00a0\nCharles E. Schumer\nBarbara Boxer\n\n\"See what happens when aliens breed with sheep and jackasses?\" the post reads.\nThe post earned some LOLs from the commenters.\u00a0\nBut at PolitiFact, we check verifiable facts, not jokes and insults, so we couldn\u2019t resist taking a closer look at the birthdays and the enduring claims about an alien landing.\nAliens or no aliens, it would be a curious occurrence indeed if nine prominent Democratic leaders, including four presidential nominees, had all been born within 30 days of each other. But they weren\u2019t. Most of the people on this list weren\u2019t born in 1948. And none of them were born in April.\nPolitiFact used two sources to check each person\u2019s birthday. Here's what we found:\u00a0\n\nAlbert A. Gore, Jr.: March 31, 1948\nHillary Rodham: Oct. 26, 1947\nJohn F. Kerry: Dec. 11, 1943\nWilliam J. Clinton: Aug. 19, 1946\nHoward Dean: Nov. 17, 1948\nNancy Pelosi: March 26, 1940\nDianne Feinstein: June 22, 1933\nCharles E. Schumer: Nov. 23, 1950\nBarbara Boxer: Nov. 11, 1940\n\nGore, the former vice president and 2000 Democratic presidential nominee, would have fit the bill if he had been born a day later.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarthest off the mark is Feinstein, California\u2019s senior senator, who was born in 1933 and will turn 87 this summer.\nThe 1947 Roswell incident\u00a0\nThe setup of the joke refers to witnesses who claim a UFO \"with five aliens aboard\" crashed just outside Roswell. It points to longstanding suspicions that the U.S. government engaged in a massive cover-up of an alien landing that occurred there.\nIt turns out there was a government cover-up that lasted nearly half a century, but it had nothing to do with aliens.\u00a0\nOn an unknown date between mid-June and early July, a rancher named Mac Brazel drove out on his lands \u2014 about 80 miles outside of Roswell \u2014 and found unfamiliar debris, including tinfoil, rubber strips, sticks and heavy paper. Brazel brought his findings to local officials at the nearby Roswell Army Air Field.\nMilitary officials initially described the debris field as the remains of a \"flying disk.\"\u00a0\nWhen news outlets began to pick up the story, U.S. Army officials quickly explained that the debris was not from a flying saucer, but from a weather balloon. Photos of the remaining wreckage were provided as proof.\u00a0\nBut then, in 1994, the U.S. Air Force changed its story again, releasing a report that admitted the \"weather balloon\" story had been fake. The report said the debris found near Roswell was consistent with a balloon device from a once top-secret operation known as Project Mogul that sought to determine via sound waves whether the Soviet Union was testing nuclear weapons.\nIn a subsequent report titled \"The Roswell Report, Case Closed,\" released in 1997, the Air Force asserted there was no evidence that a life form of any kind was found in the Roswell area that could be connected to the UFO sightings reported.\nEven so, to this day, the Roswell UFO conspiracies remain popular \u2014 and so do jokes about aliens landing there.\nOur ruling\nAn image posted on Facebook refers to theories about a UFO crash and alien landing near Roswell to skewer various prominent Democrats born \"nine months later\" in April 1948.\nNone of the Democrats listed in the post were born in April 1948. In fact, most were born at least a year\u00a0before the Roswell incident occurred.\nThe reported Roswell UFO sightings in 1947 have been explained as a case of the military using a false explanation for the debris found, in order to protect a top-secret U.S. operation to spy on the Soviets.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18262"}
