The question is particularly important in this case, since Cruz, born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father, was questioned by the first contestant Donald Trump. We have decided whether Cruz has changed his political position on whether migrant children should be American citizens if they are born in the United States. We found Cruz changed his talk about birthright, but it's not the way Rubio described it on national television. When we asked about Rubio's campaign on the indictment, they sent us a list of the attacks that Cruz was said to have changed his positions on a range of issues. However, this allegation is summarized in a radio interview in 2011 in the Duke Machado programme during the Senate campaign in Cruz. The host of the Cruise programme asked whether the issue of nationality of the right to birth should be changed in the 14th Amendment. The amendment states that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, subject to its jurisdiction, are citizens of the United States and the State in which they reside.\" Now Cruz has not given explicit support to citizenship of the right to give birth. Cruz, a former prosecutor, said that it would be difficult to reconsider this provision. \"The 14th Amendment provides for the right of citizenship at birth. I have considered the legal arguments against him, and I will tell you, as a prosecutor of the Supreme Court, that these arguments are not very good.\" \"To the extent that a person may hate a nationality policy the right to give birth is in the Constitution of the United States. And I don't like federal judges putting aside the Constitution because their political preferences are different. \"So I think it's wrong for the conservatives to focus on trying to fight what the Constitution says about true citizenship by birth. I think we're better off focusing on securing borders, because a true citizenship at birth wouldn't be a problem if we didn't have people entering illegally. The full interview is not available, so we cannot say what Cruz also said on this subject during the 2011 broadcast. Cruise pressed to clarify his opinion during the current presidential campaign and conducted a series of interviews in August 2015 to show that he was opposed to this practice. \"We must end the granting of automatic citizenship to the right to give birth to children who are here illegally,\" Cruz said in a radio interview on 19 August on \"Michael Medved Show.\" She asked Medved whether Cruz would change the Constitution if he could: \"I think that's possible, but it's difficult to achieve any constitutional amendment by nature. See, I'd like to mention, this was my position from my first day running for Senate.\" On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying that \"we are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, Cruz reiterated his position against the nation, saying that, while he was opposed to granting children of undocumented immigrants, the real problem was to prevent illegal immigration while improving border security. \"I believe the right to citizenship as a matter of meaningless politics,\" said Cruz. \"We now have more than 12 million people living here illegally. It does not make sense that our law automatically confers citizenship on their children because what it does is stimulate further illegal immigration.\" Two days later, Megyn News Fox Kelly told that true citizenship is an incentive for undocumented immigrants to come to America and that \"we must change that policy,\" but \"there is a legal dispute about the best means to do so.\" He said, \"There are serious scientists arguing that Congress can do this through a law that defines what it means to be subject to jurisdiction, the language of the 14th Amendment.\" \"There are other serious constitutional scholars arguing that the only way to change it is through a constitutional amendment. It is my view that we should strive to achieve either or both, whichever is effective; what matters is that we change policy so that we do not reward, stimulate and encourage further illegal migration.\" Is it a prank? Some conservative media outlets, and Rubio, they said it was a \"fog\" for Cruz. But it's not like that. At the latest, Cruz said in 2011 that he did not believe that changing the 14th Amendment was possible from a legal point of view, and it would be better to maintain a focus on border security. We have not been able to find any statements from Cruz that have shown anything like support for the nationality of the right to birth, and we do not read his resistance to fighting a constitutional amendment to support the concept in the way that critics do. However, there has been a shift in one thing: Cruz now says he supports the quest for change, either by amendment or by legislation. The Cruz campaign did not respond to the request for suspension by the deadline. The governor Rubio said Cruz was \"in favour of true citizenship by birth,\" but now he's against him. He referred to a radio interview in 2011 in which Cruz said that the 14th Amendment guaranteed citizenship at birth, and it would be better for the governors to focus on border security rather than trying to change the Constitution. He has since insisted on opposing the nationality of the right to birth and is now opposing it. We can't find evidence to contradict it. Cruz seems to have changed his mind about at least one thing: he said that he now supported Congress in its quest to change politics. While this raises questions about some details of Cruz's position, it is different from what Rubio claimed. We appreciate that Rubio's statement is mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05546"}
