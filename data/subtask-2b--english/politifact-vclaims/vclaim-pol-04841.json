Brian Sandoval\u2019s office says the issue is essentially settled through the state\u2019s broadly focused anti-discrimination laws.\nLawmakers in 2011 expanded the state\u2019s anti-discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression. Because these \"public accommodation\" laws cover \"place(s) of education,\" presumably school districts can\u2019t segregate transgender students from using the gendered bathroom they identify with without violating state law.\n\"No change in policy is necessary and the Obama administration has no need to have concerns about Nevada schools,\" Sandoval spokeswoman Mari St. Martin said in an earlier statement.\nSo how does the anti-bullying bill \u2014 SB504 \u2014 fit into the debate?\nNestled in the bill are several new definitions of bullying, including \"blocking access to any property or facility of a school.\"\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom brief uses that definition, along with the addition of gender identity or expression into classes protected by the legislation, to argue that it creates a \"new right\" for transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Brownback\n\n\nstated on September 5, 2007 in a debate in Durham, N.H.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn countries that allow gay marriage, the rates of heterosexual marriage \"have plummeted to where you have counties now in northern Europe where 80 percent of the first-born children are born out of wedlock.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Angie Drobnic Holan \u2022 September 6, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanson, one of the \"insurgent Republicans\" running against Anderson, referred to the ADF brief in several blog posts on his website, which also included letters from Assembly members Hansen and Shelly Shelton.\n\"President Obama recently federally mandated all locker-rooms and bathrooms be designated \u2018gender-neutral\u2019, but it was already Nevada law because of Anderson\u2019s leadership,\" Hansen said in a letter.\nAnderson called the brief \"irrelevant\" in an interview with PolitiFact. He said the legislation itself was designed to create general anti-bullying guidelines and that the bill\u2019s language was left intentionally vague.\n\"The goal was to create a vague definition so that school districts could apply their own policies,\" he said.\n\"To spin it in any other way is frankly disingenuous,\" he added.\nMcGinley says defining the law as creating a \"new right\" is probably too broad, but it\u2019s possible the new anti-bullying legislation creates additional legal standing in the event a school district is challenged in court over their policies around transgender students.\nThat\u2019s similar to how the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union plans to tackle the issue, according to the group\u2019s policy director Holly Welborn. She said the ACLU has received several complaints related to transgender student bathroom access, but any lawsuit brought by the civil liberties group would likely stand on the already-existing public accommodation laws.\n\"It (SB504) certainly isn\u2019t creating a new right, it\u2019s a right that already exists,\" Welborn said.\nDifferent statewide standards\nTransgender student access to bathrooms and other school facilities is largely dependent on individual policies of school districts.\nThe Obama administration used transgender student policy of the Washoe County School District in Reno as an example of best practices for other school districts to follow.\nThe district approved regulations last year allowing students to \"use facilities that correspond to their gender identity as expressed by the student and asserted at school\" including access to locker rooms.\nIt\u2019s a different case in the rural Elko County, where in 2015 one transgender student\u2019s request to use male-designated school facilities was rejected by the local school board (requiring the student to use unisex bathrooms instead).\nElko school district officials told a local newspaper that they interpreted the Obama administration\u2019s letter as a \"political statement\" and would continue to make decisions on transgender student access on a case-by-case basis.\nBut the vast majority of Nevada\u2019s students are in the Clark County School District (in Las Vegas), which has yet to approve district-wide regulations for transgender students.\nThe district circulated an internal draft in 2014 that would have set a more defined policy for transgender student equal access, but it was never made public. Despite a board member\u2019s 2015 request for clarity, the district has yet to approve any policy changes for transgender student access, instead making decisions on a case-by-case basis.\nDistrict spokeswoman Michelle Booth said efforts to adopt a policy are ongoing.\n\"The Clark County School District has received the \u2018Letter to Colleagues\u2019 from the U.S. Department of Education and is currently studying the details closely to determine what if any changes we will have to make to remain in compliance with federal guidelines,\" she said in an emailed statement.\nMcGinley said the uncertainty on federal and state levels means there\u2019s no clear evidence of a mandate on allowing transgender students the right to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with.\n\"Each county and school district are making these determinations based on how much risk they\u2019re willing to take,\" she said.\nOur ruling\nSeveral Republican Assembly candidates are claiming that legislators are forcing \"boys to shower with girls.\"\nPutting aside questions about the nature of gender, these ads just aren\u2019t accurate. They refer to a piece of legislation that mostly deals with creating new anti-bullying policies. There is no clearly defined mandate in Nevada state law regarding transgender student access to bathrooms and locker rooms, and school districts around the state have very different standards county-to-county. Given the likelihood of future litigation on both a federal and state level, it\u2019s misleading to connect a vaguely worded anti-bullying bill to the much more complicated area of transgender student rights.\nWe rate these ads False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b783899-a799-4b5e-be8a-eae37ab688f1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04841"}
