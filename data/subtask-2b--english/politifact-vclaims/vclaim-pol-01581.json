The blog post was cited in a news release from the conservative legal group Liberty Counsel as a \"disturbing fact\" that \"undermine(s) her story.\"\n\"Ford has a brother, Ralph Blasey, who worked for BakerHostetler, a law firm that retained Fusion GPS, the infamous DC company that produced the unverified Steele dossier on President Donald Trump and Russia, sparking the Russia investigation,\" the release states, linking to YourNewsWire.com.\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Fusion GPS has said the two cases were unrelated.\nIn a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Ford\u2019s lawyers said she had \"been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats.\" They said as a result of those threats, her family relocated out of their home. The letter also said Ford\u2019s email had been hacked and she had been impersonated online.\nOur ruling\nFord\u2019s brother, Ralph Blasey, worked for a law firm that worked with Fusion GPS nine years after he left the company. Fusion GPS\u2019s work on the Russian dossier began more than a decade after\u00a0Blasey left BakerHostetler.\nWhile it\u2019s accurate to say Blasey worked for BakerHostetler \u2014 he says that clearly on his LinkedIn \u2014\u00a0it is ridiculously wrong to somehow link her brother\u2019s past employment to Fusion GPS\u2019s work in investigating Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2018-09-21 14:09:46 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Kavanaugh accuser\u2019s brother\u2019s firm linked to Fusion GPS.\"    Bloggers Bloggers    in a blog post Monday, September 17, 2018 2018-09-17    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01581"}
