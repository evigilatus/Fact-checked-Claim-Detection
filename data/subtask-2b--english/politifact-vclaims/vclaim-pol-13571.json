Scott Walker ginned up a phony budget crisis to justify his bold bid to strip state employees of most bargaining rights and cut their benefits.\n\nA volley of e-mails, blog posts and inquiries to reporters followed a \u00a0Madison Capital Times editorial on Feb. 16, 2011, that said no state budget deficit exists for 2010-\u201911 -- or if it does, it\u2019s the fault of Walker and the Republicans in the Legislature.\n\nLiberal MSNBC talk show host Rachel Maddow joined in Feb. 17, accusing Walker of manipulating the situation for political gain.\n\n\"Despite what you may have heard about Wisconsin\u2019s finances, Wisconsin is on track to have a budget surplus this year,\" she said. \"I am not kidding.\"\n\nShe added a kicker that is also making the rounds: Walker and fellow Republicans in the Legislature this year gave away $140 million in business tax breaks -- so if there is a deficit projected of $137 million, they created it.\n\nMaddow and others making the claim all cite the same source for their information -- \u00a0a Jan. 31, 2011 memo prepared by Robert Lang, the director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\n\nIt includes this line: \"Our analysis indicates a general fund gross balance of $121.4 million and a net balance of $56.4 million.\"\n\nWe were curious about claims of a surplus based on the fiscal bureau memo.\n\nIn writing it when it was released, reporters from the Journal Sentinel and Associated Press had put the shortfall at between $78 million and \u00a0$340 million. That\u2019s the projection for the end of the fiscal year, June 30, 2011.\n\nWalker himself has settled on $137 million as the deficit figure, a number reporters have adopted as shorthand.\n\nWe re-read the fiscal bureau memo, talked to Lang, consulted reporter Jason Stein of the Journal Sentinel\u2019s Madison Bureau, read various news accounts and examined the issue in detail.\n\nOur conclusion: Maddow and the others are wrong.\n\nThere is, indeed, a projected deficit that required attention, and Walker and GOP lawmakers did not create it.\n\nMore on that second point in a bit.\n\nThe confusion, it appears, stems from a section in Lang\u2019s memo that -- read on its own -- does project a $121 million surplus in the state\u2019s general fund as of June 30, 2011.\n\nBut the remainder of the routine memo -- consider it the fine print -- outlines $258 million in unpaid bills or expected shortfalls in programs such as Medicaid services for the needy ($174 million alone), the public defender\u2019s office and corrections. Additionally, the state owes Minnesota $58.7 million under a discontinued tax reciprocity deal.\n\nThe result, by our math and Lang\u2019s, is the $137 million shortfall.\n\nIt would be closer to the $340 million figure if the figure included the $200 million owed to the state\u2019s patient compensation fund, a debt courts have declared resulted from an illegal raid on the fund under former Gov. Jim Doyle.\n\nA court ruling is pending in that matter, so the money might not have to be transferred until next budget year.\n\nTo be sure, the projected shortfall is a modest one by the standards of the last decade, which saw a $600 million repair bill one year as the economy and national tax collections slumped.\n\nBut ignoring it would have meant turning away eligible Medicaid clients, which was not an option, Lang said.\n\nThis same situation has happened in the past, including during the tenure of Doyle, a Democrat. In January 2005, a fiscal bureau memo showed a similar surplus, but lawmakers approved a major fix of a Medicaid shortfall that would have eaten up that projected surplus.\n\nReporters who cover the Capitol are used to doing the math to come up with the bottom-line surplus or deficit, but average readers are not. (The Journal Sentinel\u2019s Stein addressed these and other budget questions in a follow-up story.)\n\nSo why does Lang write his biennial memo in a way that invites confusion?\n\nLang, a veteran and respected civil servant working in a nonpartisan job, told us he does not want to presume what legislative or other action will be taken to address the potential shortfalls he lists.\n\nAdmittedly, the approach this time created the opportunity for a snappy -- and powerful -- political attack.\n\nBut it is an inaccurate one.\n\nMeanwhile, what about Maddow\u2019s claim -- also repeated across the liberal blogosphere -- that Walker\u2019s tax-cut bills approved in January are responsible for the $137 million deficit?\n\nLang\u2019s fiscal bureau report and news accounts addressed that issue as well.\n\nThe tax cuts will cost the state a projected $140 million in tax revenue -- but not until the next two-year budget, from July 2011 to June 2013. The cuts are not even in effect yet, so they cannot be part of the current problem.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line:\n\nThere is fierce debate over the approach Walker took to address the short-term budget deficit. But there should be no debate on whether or not there is a shortfall. While not historically large, the shortfall in the current budget needed to be addressed in some fashion. Walker\u2019s tax cuts will boost the size of the projected deficit in the next budget, but they\u2019re not part of this problem and did not create it.\n\nWe rate Maddow\u2019s take False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13571"}
