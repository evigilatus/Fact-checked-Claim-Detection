It said:\u00a0\n\"The owner of Taco Bell said them animals need to be shot (black ppl)! So stp spending money there.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nDetails of this incident are unclear, but there\u2019s nothing to support the contention that \"the owner\" of Taco Bell, or even an owner of a Taco Bell franchise, is involved.\nTaco Bell is actually owned by Louisville-based Yum! Brands, a global publicly traded fast-food company. Individuals can be franchisees, owning one or more restaurants.\nThe post we\u2019re checking does not indicate where the alleged threatening remark was made. But a follow-up post by the user gave a man\u2019s name and referred to him as the Taco Bell owner.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Facebook users weighed in. One linked to a June 2 article on Hip-HopVibe.com that said Facebook posters had identified the same man as the owner of a Taco Bell in Louisiana and as the one who made the statement.\nWe found a screenshot being shared on Facebook that shows what the post said: \"I want those animals shot in the street for destroying peoples lives and businesses! All demoncrat cities. Go figure!\"\nIt does not mention black people specifically.\nTaco Bell seemed to confirm that some threatening statement of this type had been made, but by a former employee of one of its franchised restaurants, not an owner.\n\"We confirmed with the franchisee that this individual no longer works for them and hasn\u2019t in some time,\" Taco Bell said in a statement to PolitiFact. \"Taco Bell believes in all people and does not tolerate any kind of discrimination.\"\u00a0\nThe company did not reply to our request for more details.\u00a0\nThe post misrepresents the original comment and the speaker\u2019s connection to Taco Bell. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17931"}
