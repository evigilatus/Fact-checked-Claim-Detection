Under the leadership of President Barack Obama, Trump noted that direct meetings had never taken place. Trump said, \"No one was going to meet.\" \"President Obama wanted to meet, and President Kim will not meet him. The Obama administration was begging for a meeting. They were constantly begging for meetings. President Kim will not meet him.\" The authorization that Obama and his administration \"were begging for a meeting\" is not supported by the record. We contacted the press office at the White House and the staff had no comment. The preconditions for the talks of the Special Representative of Obama for North Korea &apos; s policy, Glen Davis, set the position of the Administration for the senators at a hearing in 2013. \"The United States will not engage in talks for talks,\" said Davis March 7, 2013. The United States will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. We will not reward the Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea for the absence of bad behaviour. We will not compensate the Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea for just returning to dialogue. We have also made it clear that relations between the United States and the Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea cannot improve fundamentally without the sustainable improvement of inter-Korean relations and human rights. We will not allow North Korea to provoke its neighbours. These attitudes will not change.\" This policy followed discussions with North Korean negotiators in 2011 with a view to resuming stronger talks that have been suspended since 2008. At the outset, Pyongyang indicated that it was ready for the return of international inspectors, a moratorium on nuclear testing, long-range missile launches and all nuclear activities, including uranium enrichment. In 2012, the operation was disrupted when North Korea announced plans to launch a satellite, a movement called \"Breaking the Deal\" by Americans. The North Korean expert, Frank Janozzi, President of the Mansfield Foundation, said that Obama was \"reserved to involving the Commander-in-Chief without having the pieces in place.\" He said: \"Obama has never, as far as I know, asked much less for a meeting with Kim Jong On.\" \"In fact, he has followed the confrontational approach, which has become known as strategic patience.\" On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the US Navy commander, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for security purposes, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, Obama, in his state of union address in 2013, spoke of the preconditions for talks. Obama said: \"The North Korean regime must know that only by fulfilling its international obligations will they achieve security and prosperity.\" Joseph Dethomas at the Pennsylvania School of International Affairs said he was not aware that Obama had tried to meet Kim at all. Dethomas said: \"Definitely in Chapter II, the United States has adapted all talks in very strict terms.\" The nearest Obama came, said Kelsey Davenport with the Arms Control Association, to hold talks as a reward for the strong promises of change from North Korea. \"The Obama administration has remained open to talks with North Korea, but has established onerous preconditions that require Pyongyang to take steps towards nuclear disarmament before negotiations begin,\" said Davenport. David Albright and the Institute of Science and International Security echoed all of the above. \"I've never heard that before,\" said Albright. In addition, the Obama Administration has imposed severe economic sanctions on North Korea, including on Kim himself. Our verdict, Trump, said that Obama's administration was begging for a meeting with Kim. The public record shows that the Obama administration rejected the idea of holding meetings of any kind until North Korea promised to retreat from its nuclear programme and accept international inspections. Although North Korea &apos; s hope to meet those preconditions during Obama &apos; s first term was borne by the administration, the second phase took a more difficult line. There is no evidence that Obama begged for a meeting. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00470"}
