While we waited for a response, we looked on our own.\nFor historical minimum wage data, we went to the U.S. Department of Labor. During the time period Reed was talking about, the minimum rose six times, starting at 40 cents per hour and eventually reaching $1.60.\nHow much did it take to lift someone out of poverty during that era? That's a much harder question to answer, and it depends on the size of the family, something Reed wasn't specific about.\nThe federal poverty level, the adequacy of which is still the subject of debate, wasn't developed until the early 1960s, so it wasn't even in existence during the start of the time period Reed was talking about.\nThe first \"poverty threshold,\" in 1963, was about $3,100 for a family of four.\nSomeone earning the minimum wage that year would have earned $2,460, enough for a family of three but not a family of four, according to the \"Social Welfare and the Economy\" page on the Social Security Administration's Office of Retirement and Disability Policy website.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose data only go back to 1959. We used a cost of living calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to get a rough idea of living costs from 1950 through 1958.\nAccording to our calculations, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the minimum wage was high enough to keep an individual above the poverty level\nThe first time it was enough to push a two-person family above the poverty level was in 1956, when it jumped to $1 an hour.\nBut throughout the 1950s and 1960s, in most years, the minimum wage couldn\u2019t lift a family of three out of poverty and was never enough for a family of four.\nWhen we shared our information with Reed's office, they provided information that confirmed our findings.\nReed spokesman Chip Unruh said the senator\u2019s statement about the minimum wage and poverty levels in the \u201850s and \u201860s is accurate.\n\"I think it is very clear that Reed is talking about his perception that hard work used to get you a livable wage,\" he said. \"The federal poverty rate as measured today didn't always exist as a unit of measurement, but that doesn't mean poverty itself didn't exist . . . Reed referenced families earlier in his speech, but he also was referencing individuals.\"\nOur ruling\nSen. Jack Reed, lobbying for an increase in the minimum wage, said that in the 1950s and 1960s, \"the minimum wage was such that it would lift you out of poverty.\"\nWe found that during that period, the minimum wage always generated enough income to keep an individual out of poverty.\nBut when it comes to making enough money to support a family -- and Reed made several references to families -- that wasn't always true during those two decades.\nBased on federal data, the minimum wage didn't become high enough to support a two-person family until about 1956 and it wasn't consistently high enough to lift a family of three until 1967. It never covered a family of four, regarded as a typical family size in that era.\nOne might assume that Reed was talking about families, but the statement we're checking isn't specific. Because that statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it\u00a0Mostly True.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07740"}
