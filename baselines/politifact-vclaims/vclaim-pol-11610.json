I have grandchildren and I always watched it with all four of my children. Tough times make for tough choices.\"\n\nCIANCI: \"But 'Sesame Street'? My God.\"\n\nLICHT: \"Hopefully, Channel 36 will be aggressive, go out and find some good charitable sponsors to help support this.\"\n\nCIANCI (facetiously): \"Especially in this economy, they're going to just fork over $800,000.\"\n\nLICHT: \"We aren't the only state cutting back on public television. It's not anything that we're happy about and, again, that's something that might be reversed [if better higher revenue estimates come in], but the facts are, tough times, tough choices.\"\n\nWe were interested in whether Licht was correct that other states are cutting back on public television and, if so, how many.\n\nWe called the governor's office to ask for Licht's source.\n\nMeanwhile, we talked to David Piccerelli, president of Rhode Island PBS.\n\n\"The proposal is to fund us through December 31 of 2012 and then shut off funding altogether,\" he said. In the current fiscal year, the state contributes $922,000 to RIPBS's total budget of $2.9 million. That's 31 percent.\n\nAnother 27 percent comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund stations throughout the United States. (The CPB itself has been repeatedly threatened with the cutoff of federal funds by conservatives.)\n\nThe remaining 42 percent comes from fundraising. Piccerelli said about 85 cents out of every dollar raised is from individual donors. Corporate support accounts for no more than 15 cents, down from close to 30 cents on the dollar around 2004-2005, before the Rhode Island economy took a faceplant.\n\nPiccerelli said some states HAVE been cutting back their support; Chafee's office sent us information confirming that.\n\nLast June, New Hampshire Public Television eliminated 20 full-time workers and cut staff salaries by as much as 10 percent after it lost $2.7 million in state funding, or about 30 percent of its budget.\n\nAt the same time, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, backed by the state legislature, eliminated funding for New Jersey public television, which resulted in the 40-year-old New Jersey Network being taken over by WNET in New York and NJN's nine radio licenses being sold to stations in New York and Philadelphia.\n\nStacey Karp, director of communications for the Association of Public Television Stations, said four other states -- Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania and South Carolina -- have also eliminated funding. For details, she sent us to Skip Hinton, president of the National Educational Telecommunications Association, a professional association that represents stations in every state.\n\nHe told us that 38 states were providing direct support to public broadcasting in 2007. It's now down to 32.\n\nOf the 32, \"most have seen pretty significant reductions in state funding over the last four years,\" he said.\n\nAt least one state -- Illinois -- increased its contribution to public television, boosting funding by 16 percent last year, following cuts in previous years. \n\nOur ruling\n\nRichard Licht, Chafee's director of administration, said, \"We aren't the only state cutting back on public television.\"\n\nTurns out, he\u2019s right. Five states have eliminated funding and others have cut their contributions. \n\nWe rate his statement True.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.
