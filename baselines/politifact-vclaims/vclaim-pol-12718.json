Divvying up the cash is no cakewalk, either.\n\nArea leaders have asked for billions of dollars in transportation projects they think the region needs, but the proposed 1-cent sales tax can\u2019t pay for all of them.\n\nIn fact, it won\u2019t even cover most of them, Johns Creek Mayor Mike Bodker said.\n\n\"Let's keep in mind that less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs are covered in this referendum,\" Bodker told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a recent news story.\n\nLess than one-tenth? But won\u2019t the tax rake in billions of dollars?\n\nBefore we address Bodker\u2019s claim, let\u2019s take a quick detour into the complex realm of transportation planning.\n\nSince the effects of a single project can cross city and county boundaries, much of the region\u2019s transportation planning is handled by the Atlanta Regional Commission. The planning body helps area governments with issues that need regional coordination, such as clean air, water and aging.\n\nAs part of its duties, the ARC drafted Plan 2040, which maps out transportation, land use, environmental, economic, housing and human service strategies covering the 18-county area for the next 30 years.\n\nPlan 2040 estimates what the region needs, what it will cost and how much it can afford. It found that the region needs about $126 billion in transportation projects. It can probably pay for about $60.9 billion, according to a Plan 2040 report.\n\nAs the ARC formed transportation plans for metro Atlanta, state legislators worked to find ways to fund needs across Georgia. Their efforts resulted in the 2010 passage of the Transportation Investment Act.\n\nThis legislation created special regional transportation tax districts across the state, including one in metro Atlanta. This district includes 10 counties: Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale.\n\nA roundtable made up of Atlanta-area elected officials must come up with a list of projects for the taxing district that can be completed with money from a 1-cent sales tax. If voters back the tax in a 2012 referendum, it gets levied and construction begins.\n\nAtlanta-area jurisdictions have submitted $22.9 billion in eligible projects they would like to see funded by the referendum. The roundtable is trying to cut the list down to an affordable level.\n\nThis brings us back to Bodker. As mayor of Johns Creek, he thinks the referendum has a better chance at success if leaders promise to use the money to build road projects.\n\nWe asked Bodker how he determined that the upcoming referendum would cover \"less than one-tenth\" of the region\u2019s transportation needs.\n\nBodker was talking about money, he told us. To get the \"one-tenth\" figure, he compared the amount of revenue the tax is expected to raise with the estimated cost of building the projects metro Atlanta needs.\n\nThrough Plan 2040, regional planners calculated all the projects the area needs would cost some $120 billion, but the referendum is estimated to bring in only $7.2 billion, Bodker said. That\u2019s less than 10 percent.\n\nThe federal government will likely match some of the money metro Atlanta raises from its tax, boosting the amount of transportation projects the region can afford. Still, most of the region\u2019s needs will remain unmet.\n\nWe checked Bodker\u2019s figures with those from the ARC, and they are very close. But there\u2019s one small hitch.\n\nA state economist determined that, depending on economic conditions, the 1-cent sales tax could raise between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion in 2011 dollars, according to ARC documents. Since the current Plan 2040 draft says the region needs $126 billion in projects, the potential tax revenue does amount to \"less than one-tenth\" of the need, as Bodker said. \u00a0\n\nFurthermore, projects that make the roundtable list will receive only an estimated $6.1 billion of the tax revenue, an ARC spokeswoman said. The remainder will go to localities. The $6.1 billion figure is also less than 10 percent of the regional need. \u00a0\n\nThe hitch is that Plan 2040\u2019s cost estimate defines the Atlanta region as an 18-county area. The state Legislature designed the planned referendum to cover a smaller, 10-county region. Determining how much of the $120 billion would address needs for the smaller 10-county region is problematic because major projects can affect traffic in multiple counties. \u00a0\n\nThat said, this quirk does not render Bodker\u2019s statement inaccurate. It may have been more precise for him to say that the 10-county referendum funds less than 10 percent of the 18-county region\u2019s needs, but we think it\u2019s safe to say your average voter doesn\u2019t parse regional definitions this closely.\n\nWe therefore rule Bodker\u2019s statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVernon Jones\n\n\nstated on June 3, 2010 in a candidate forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Four years as a congressman, he [U.S. Rep.
