(We know Walker didn\u2019t personally pen it because it\u2019s signed \"TW,\" for Team Walker).\nThe tweet highlighted a chart showing Americans collectively paid $4.8 trillion in taxes in 2014, more than the total of the three life essentials.\nIt\u2019s a claim PolitiFact National checked in 2014 and 2011 after identical statements by the Tax Foundation and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, respectively.\nBoth those were rated Half True. Let\u2019s see what the latest figures show.\nDigging into the numbers\nWalker\u2019s campaign told us he relied on the Tax Foundation\u2019s annual \"tax freedom\" day report. Among other things, that report examines taxing and spending figures based on U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data.\nBoth the Tax Foundation and Walker make clear they are using collective taxing and spending figures -- by using a chart, in Walker\u2019s case, and words and charts in the Tax Foundation\u2019s case.\nOne cautionary note: Full data is not yet available for 2015, since we are not even at the midpoint of the year. The Tax Foundation based its claim about 2015 on 2014 figures that it adjusts for economic growth predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the group.\nWe checked the BEA\u2019s data for 2014, the latest available, and found a significant edge for total taxes paid over the aggregate amount spend on food, housing and clothing.\nTotal spending on groceries, restaurant meals, clothing, footwear, housing and utilities came to $4.2 trillion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, taxes -- local, state and federal -- rang up to $4.9 trillion.\nFor perspective, total personal consumer expenditures, which includes additional things like vehicles, recreation and health care, were $11.9 trillion in 2014.\nIn recent years, the federal figures show, taxes have consistently topped food, shelter and clothing.\nAnother perspective\nBut PolitiFact National\u2019s earlier work points out there is another way to look at the comparison: by examining what individual Americans pay.\nThat\u2019s a complex task, but one way to do it is to examine what people at different income levels spend and pay in taxes as a share of their total income.\nThrough that lens, many poorer Americans likely pay a higher share of their income on food, shelter and clothing, in part because they pay little in taxes.\nConversely, richer Americans may well pay a higher fraction of their income in taxes and a smaller share for those essentials.\nSo by this other method, for many people, Walker\u2019s claim does not hold up. The 2014 item concluded that a majority of Americans probably pay more for the three essentials than for taxes.\nOur rating\nWalker claimed, based on what happened in 2014, that Americans in 2015 collectively will spend more on taxes than they do on food, housing and clothing combined.\nThe statement is partially accurate -- on target based on past experience by the method Walker uses, but inaccurate by another method that examines the claim in a fuller context.\nThat\u2019s a Half True on our meter.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06488"}
