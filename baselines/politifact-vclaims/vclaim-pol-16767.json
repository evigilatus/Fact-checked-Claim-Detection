Bush who was in office in 2001 and was famously reading a children\u2019s book called \"The Pet Goat\" to a class of first graders when the attacks happened.\u00a0\nObama was serving in the Illinois State Senate in 2001. The image of him that appears in the Facebook post is real, but it\u2019s just been doctored to look like he\u2019s watching a basketball game. There\u2019s no TV in the original photo, image No. 8 in this slideshow, taken by then-White House photographer Pete Souza. Rather, Obama is meeting with his national security adviser, Tom Danilon, Chief of Staff Jack Lew, and Denis McDonough, deputy national-security adviser, on Nov. 14, 2012.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has been edited into this photo taken by Reuters photographer Shannon Stapleton. It shows rescue workers removing Father Mychal Judge from the World Trade Center tower on Sept. 11.\nTrump was near the Ground Zero site two days after the attacks when he gave a TV interview a few blocks away. As we\u2019ve noted in a previous fact-check, that interview marked the first of several times when he would say, without evidence, that he had sent a lot of men to help in the area.\u00a0\nRichard Alles, a New York Department battalion chief on Sept. 11, told us that he had no knowledge of Trump being at the site or sending workers there to help.\u00a0\n\"I was in a supervisory role with the fire department at the time,\" said Alles, who said he was on the scene about 20 minutes after the second building collapsed. \"I was there for several months \u2014\u00a0I have no knowledge of his being down there.\"\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16767"}
