Other G-7 members gave the idea a cool reception.\u00a0\nDuring a post-summit question-and-answer session with journalists, Trump was asked about it.\nYamiche Alcindor of PBS asked Trump, \"Why do you think it\u2019s appropriate to invite Russia to the G-7, given that they\u2019ve meddled in the 2016 election? And are you worried that if Russia does come to the G-7, that it might hurt you politically, because it\u2019s only going to be a couple months before the 2020 election?\nTrump said it was better to have Russia inside the room than outside, but he then turned his focus to his predecessor, President Barack Obama. \"A lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama,\" Trump said.\u00a0\nTrump cited Crimea, a peninsula located on the Black Sea. Following the ousting of Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces invaded Crimea in 2014 and officially absorbed it into Russia. (Until 1954, Crimea had previously been part of Russia.).\n\"It was sort of taken away from President Obama,\" Trump said. \"Not taken away from President Trump; taken away from President Obama. President Obama was not happy that this happened because it was embarrassing to him. Right? It was very embarrassing to him. And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the \u2018G-8.\u2019 And that was his determination. He was outsmarted by Putin. He was outsmarted. President Putin outsmarted President Obama.\"\nExperts contacted by PolitiFact said Trump\u2019s statement is filled with misleading assertions.\nFor starters, Russia did invade and, eventually, annex Crimea during Obama\u2019s presidency -- in February and March 2014. But Russia didn\u2019t take Crimea away from either Obama or the United States \u2013 it took the region away from Ukraine, of which it which it was an internationally recognized part.\nTrump\u2019s statement is \"a very odd way of thinking about Crimea and the United States\u2019 role in Ukraine,\" said Susanne Wengle, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame. \"It is highly misleading and factually incorrect. The U.S. exercised a certain influence among certain Kiev and Ukrainian politicians \u2013 how much and whom is disputed \u2013 but the U.S. never \u2018had\u2019 Crimea.\"\nIn addition, Trump\u2019s phrasing \u2013 \"sort of taken away\" \u2013 soft-pedals Russia\u2019s coercive actions in seizing Crimea, said Anders \u00c5slund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \"This is not what you call a military occupation,\" \u00c5slund said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that, despite Trump\u2019s focus on his predecessor, Obama wasn\u2019t alone in opposing Russia\u2019s annexation. Virtually the entire global community refused to recognize the annexation, which was the first such takeover in Europe since the end of the Cold War.\n\"Europe, the United Nations and other U.S. allies opposed the invasion and annexation,\" said Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. \"It wasn\u2019t just Obama who opposed it.\"\nTrump\u2019s statement is problematic for other reasons.\nWhile the Obama administration did support Russia\u2019s expulsion from the G-8 over the annexation of Crimea, it did not do so unilaterally, and in fact could not have acted unilaterally.\n\"The G-7 was united behind the decision to kick out Russia from G-8, so it was a common consensus decision,\" \u00c5slund said.\nIn a communique dated March 24, 2014, the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Council and the European Commission jointly wrote that they \"strongly condemn\" Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea.\nThe signatories agreed that they would not participate in a scheduled G-8 meeting in Sochi, Russia, and that they would \"suspend our participation in the G-8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G-8 is able to have a meaningful discussion.\"\nTo date, the G-8 has not invited Russia back into the fold.\nAll in all, Trump \"seems to find it hard to believe that there could be any reason other than embarrassment to oppose aggression and territorial dismemberment of a major European state,\" said Steve Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that Crimea \"was sort of taken away from President Obama. \u2026 And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination.\"\nObama did oppose Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and back its expulsion from the G-8, but Trump\u2019s view leaves out much of the story.\nTrump\u2019s remark ignores both widespread opposition to Russian\u2019s actions within Europe and among U.S. allies, as well as the strongly worded decision by the remaining G-7 nations to expel Russia from the group. It also ignores that Crimea was \"taken away\" from Ukraine, not Obama.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00222"}
