It found 1 people per 1,000. In other words, Black people in Virginia were 3.5 times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana.\nThat\u2019s very similar to findings in a study issued by the American Civil Liberties Union on April 20, 2020. The study said Black peoples were 3.4 times more likely than white people to be arrested in Virginia for marijuana crimes in 2018. Virginia ranked 27th among 49 states that provided data to the ACLU, which wants marijuana to be legalized (Florida did not cooperate).\nNationally, Black people were 3.6 times more likely than white people to be run in for marijuana between 2010 and 2018, according to the ACLU. .\nJLARC found that, from 2015 through 2019, Black people were more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana in each of 88 Virginia localities from which there was enough data to draw a conclusion. The largest discrepancy was in Carroll County, where Black people were 40.4 times more likely than white people to be run in for pot.\nIn\u00a0Hanover County, Black people\u00a0were 14.8 times more likely than\u00a0white people to be arrested for marijuana.\u00a0The racial disparity was 6.4 times higher for Black people in Richmond, 5.2 times higher in Henrico County, and four times higher in Chesterfield County.\nAccording to JLARC, Virginia averaged 22,000 marijuana arrests a year during the last decade. \"The vast majority...have been for possession of small amounts of marijuana,\" the agency wrote. \"There were about 10 times as many arrests for marijuana possession as for distribution or other marijuana offenses.\"\u00a0\nMarijuana convictions\nJLARC found that Black people in Virginia were four times more likely than white people to be convicted on marijuana charges from 2010 to 2019. Four Black people per thousand were found guilty, compared to one white person per thousand.\u00a0\nAccording to JLARC, 58% of all state marijuana arrests in 2018 resulted in convictions, the vast majority of them winding up with \"fines, court fees and driver license suspensions.\" Forty percent of the cases were dismissed by prosecutors or judges, and 2% resulted in not-guilty verdicts.\nJLARC found Black people were more likely to be prosecuted on pot charges in each of 83 localities where there was enough data to draw a conclusion.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nIn his bid to legalize pot in Virginia, Northam said, \"People of color and those of not, they use marijuana at the same rate. People of color are three times more likely to get arrested and convicted.\"\nSurveys show Black people and white people do use pot at just about the same rate in Virginia. But Black people are 3.5 times more likely than white people to get arrested in Virginia for marijuana offenses, and four times more likely to get convicted.\nIf anything, Northam has slightly understated his case, but we don\u2019t usually penalize for that.
