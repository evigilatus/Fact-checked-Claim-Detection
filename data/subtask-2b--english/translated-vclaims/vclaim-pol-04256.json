In the first presidential debate, she suggested that one reason he hesitated was that Trump did not pay federal taxes. \"Maybe the American people don't want, each one of you watching tonight, to know that he didn't pay anything in federal taxes, because the only years anyone ever saw were a few years when he had to hand them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and he was trying to get a casino license. Trump's response is that not paying taxes makes me smart. In fact, neither Clinton nor Trump have the right talking points. We looked at a similar allegation from Clinton earlier and found it often wrong. The fact is, none of the tax returns you're talking about have been released, and they ignore the other returns that New Jersey casinos have tested. The evidence is available in the 1981 report, which analysed Trump's money as part of his efforts to obtain a casino license for a proposed casino hotel complex. The report details, on page 33, Trump &apos; s income and federal tax payments for the period 1975-1979. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2021 the report states that Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years in the amount of $71,932 on the reported income of $219,334. (In current United States dollars, this amount would amount to $296,121 paid in taxes on reported income of $910,319. In the last two years, federal income taxes have not been paid because, according to tax rules, money is lost each year - more than $3.8 million at the time, or about $12.8 million today. New Jersey's gambling enforcement department is checking his income, losses and discount. The department said Trump's losses came from the operation of his various properties. However, the report does not provide any details. We asked both Clinton and Trump campaigns if they had any additional information since our original investigation. We didn't hear a reply. Our rule, Clinton, said, \"The only years anyone has seen\" from Trump's tax revenues, \"he showed that he didn't pay any federal income tax.\" According to these records, covering five years of revenue, Trump paid federal income taxes in three of the five years. In two years he didn't do it. The tax returns themselves remain confidential. The Clinton Statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6adfa4d3-c309-41e1-940d-d064448c5548", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04256"}
