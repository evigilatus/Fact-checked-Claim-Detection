(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe reached out to CNN about the post and Liza Pluto, a spokesperson for Baldwin\u2019s show, told us it\u2019s not accurate.\u00a0\n\"This is not true and Brooke did not say that,\" she said.\u00a0\nSearching Nexis for news coverage of that quote, we found no results.\u00a0\nWe did find stories from 2015 about an apology from Baldwin over comments she made about veterans \u2014\u00a0just not what appears in this Facebook post.\u00a0\nOn April 28, 2015, Baldwin interviewed the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., on camera amid protests and violence in Baltimore in the wake of Freddie Gray\u2019s death in police custody. Speaking about police training, she said: \"I was talking to a city councilman here last week who was saying, \u2018Brooke, these people have to live in the communities. There\u2019s no emotional, or there\u2019s a lack of emotional investment,\u2019 and a lot of these young people \u2026 and I love our nation\u2019s veterans, but some of them are coming back from war, they don\u2019t know the communities and they\u2019re ready to do battle.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was quickly criticized, garnering headlines like this one from Breitbart: \"CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin blames military veterans for Baltimore riots.\"\nAs the Washington Post\u2019s media critic documented, she tweeted that same day: \"Folks. Please don\u2019t misunderstand me. Dear friends/family of mine are veterans. I was repeating a concern vocalized to me lately. That\u2019s it.\"\u00a0\nThe next morning, though, she went on air to apologize.\u00a0\n\"I made a mistake yesterday,\" she said. I was recounting a story, a conversation I had had recently just referring to police. And I absolutely misspoke, I inartfully chose my words 100% and I just wish speaking to all of you this morning: I wholeheartedly retract what I said.\"\nLater on air she said she \"gave credence to the idea that veterans returning from war who were police officers were furthering the problems in communities like these here in Baltimore and nationwide. And I just have to take a moment again today and say I was wrong. I was so wrong.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post claims Baldwin said: \"Don\u2019t hire veterans! They\u2019re too damaged to be trusted with authority.\"\nWe didn\u2019t find any credible evidence that she said that. The statement appears to be an\u00a0interpretation of comments she made involving veterans during an interview, but it goes too far by presenting incendiary words as if Baldwin herself said them.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00023"}
