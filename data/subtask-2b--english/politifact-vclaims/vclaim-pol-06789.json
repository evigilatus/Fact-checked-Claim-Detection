Scott Walker has spent more time speaking on foreign policy.\nOne of his talking points: Leadership trumps experience when it comes to managing affairs overseas. Look at Ronald Reagan. \u00a0\nThat was Walker\u2019s response Jan. 21, 2015 when he was asked on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" about the importance of foreign policy experience. First, the governor criticized the secretary of state record of Hillary Clinton, the leading potential Democratic candidate for 2016.\nThen he turned to Reagan, one of his political heroes, and one of the Republican president\u2019s early acts in office -- the mass firing of most of the nation\u2019s air traffic controllers.\nIn August 1981, after contract talks between the federal government and the union for the controllers stalled, nearly 13,000 controllers walked off the job. Just seven months into his first term, Reagan called the strike illegal and demanded they return to work. When more than 11,000 didn't, Reagan fired them in what was an unprecedented action.\nIn his MSNBC interview, Walker asserted that the move was one of the most important foreign policy decisions \"made in our lifetime,\" showing allies and adversaries around the world \"that we were serious.\"\nThen he added this:\n\"Years later, documents released from the Soviet Union showed that that exactly was the case. The Soviet Union started treating (Reagan) more seriously once he did something like that. Ideas have to have consequences. And I think (President Barack Obama) has failed mainly because he's made threats and hasn't followed through on them.\"\nSo, Walker goes beyond stating an opinion about the foreign policy implications of Reagan\u2019s move. He states as fact that there are Soviet documents showing the Soviets treated the Reagan more seriously because he fired American air traffic controllers.\nThat\u2019s a bold claim.\nWalker's evidence\nWhen we asked for evidence to back the claim, both the governor's office and Walker's campaign cited statements from a variety of people. Each essentially said the firings showed Reagan meant what he said, and that he was to be taken seriously.\nSome examples:\nReagan special assistant Peggy Noonan wrote in her White House memoir that George Shultz, who became Reagan's secretary state a year after the firings, had called the firings the most important foreign policy decision Reagan ever made. Joseph McCartin, the author of a book on the strike, wrote that when House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill, a Democrat, visited Moscow not long after the strike, \"he learned that the Soviet leaders had been deeply impressed by Reagan\u2019s actions.\" And Reagan biographer Edmund Morris wrote: \"Former Soviet apparatchiks will tell you that it was not his famous 'evil empire' speech in 1983 that convinced them he meant strategic business, so much as photographs of the leader of the air traffic controllers union being taken to jail in 1981.\"\nThose are perceptions of Americans, however. Walker's claim was the Soviets treated Reagan more seriously after he fired the controllers, and that Soviet documents prove it. \u00a0\nBut he did not provide us anything referencing Soviet documents.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd apparently there are no such documents that have been made public.\nExperts\nFive experts told us they had never heard of such documents. Several were incredulous at the notion.\nMcCartin, a Georgetown University labor history expert who wrote the book about the strike that Walker cited, said: \"I am not aware of any such documents. \u00a0If they did exist, I would love to see them.\"\nSvetlana Savranskaya, director of Russia programs at the National Security Archive at George Washington University, told us she \"had to listen to the Walker interview twice, so ridiculous is the statement about the air traffic controllers. There is absolutely no evidence of this. I would love to see the released Soviet documents on this subject that he has apparently seen.\"\nJames Graham Wilson, a historian at the U.S. State Department, also told us he was not aware of any Soviet documents showing Moscow\u2019s internal response to the controller firings. He speculated that there could be such records, given how some Soviet experts characterized the firings.\nWilson and other authors have noted the perspective of Richard Pipes, professor emeritus of Russian studies at Harvard University. Pipes said the firings showed the Soviets that Reagan was \"a man who, when aroused, will go to the limit to back up his principles.\"\nBut even as the firings gained the attention of the Soviets, there were other U.S.-Soviet matters during 1981 that were also important.\u00a0With his first budget, Reagan added $26 billion in defense spending, accelerating the placement of new tanks and warplanes, and he embarked on a modernization of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons. Reagan also wrote to Soviet leaders imploring them to alleviate Cold War tensions and negotiate arms reductions. \u00a0\u00a0\nIn any case, the lack of Soviet records described by Walker is clear.\nReagan's own ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, told us: \"It's utter nonsense. There is no evidence of that whatever.\"\nMatlock questioned whether Soviet leaders even paid much attention to the firings, saying: \"At that point, their big question was whether (Reagan) was going to attack them.\"\nOur rating\nTouching on foreign policy issues, Walker said: \"Documents released from the Soviet Union\" show \"the Soviet Union started treating\" Ronald Reagan more seriously after Reagan fired the air traffic controllers.\nThere is a view, echoed by Walker, that the firings caught the Soviets\u2019 attention. But Walker cited no Soviet documents showing that the firings made the Soviets treat Reagan more seriously. And experts, several of whom felt Walker\u2019s claim is outrageous, told us they are not aware that any such documents exist.\nFor a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire.\n------\nMore on Scott Walker\nFor profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06789"}
