Not in any way we can find. Let us review the record of what Trump said about Iraq's war. The war began in March 2003. :: We searched the Nexis database of the press and news reports from 2002 to 2008. From what we found, if Trump saw regional instability on the horizon, he kept it secret. In an interview in September 2002, Jock Howard Stern Trump asked whether he supported Iraq's invasion. Trump answered: \"Yeah, I think so.\" This is not a ringing support for war, but Trump did not denounce the march towards military action in the way thousands of demonstrators had been doing for months in 2002. In January 28, 2003, just three months before the invasion, Neil Cafoto of Fox News Trump asked whether President George W. Bush should focus more on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said: \"Well, either he does something or he doesn't do anything, maybe, because maybe we shouldn't do it yet, and maybe we should wait for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a pretty good job. But, of course, if you look at polls, a lot of people get a little tired. I believe that the Iraqi situation is a problem. I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.\" Trump seemed to doubt the task here in Iraq, and the economy should be a higher priority. However, he did not say anything similar to his claim that Bush should not continue because war would \" destabilize the Middle East.\" About a week after the war began, Trump gave a mix of views. At the Academy Awards after the party, Trump said that \"war is a mess,\" according to the Washington Post. But he also told Fox News that because of the war, \"the market will rise like a rocket.\" On September 11, 2003, Tramp told MSNBC, \"It wasn't wrong to fight terrorism and fight it harshly, and I think maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, by 2004, Trump began to take a stronger stand against the war. .......................................................................................................................... On April 16, 2004, Trump returned with Stern. \"I think Iraq is a terrible mistake,\" said Trump. \"I think that when we leave, this is a nice democratic state. I mean, give me a chance. There is usually a reason for the State to run in a particular way.\" Trump expanded on this in an article in August 2004 in Esquire: \"Look at the war in Iraq and the chaos we are in. I wouldn't have handled it that way. Does anyone really think that Iraq would be a great democracy where people would run into the voting box and gently put in their vote and the winner would happily advance to lead the country? Come on. Two minutes after we leave, there will be a revolution, the smartest, most violent man who will take over. He will have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam did not have. \"What's the purpose of all this thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people were killed. And what about the people who come back without arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All these Iraqi children that were blown to pieces. It turned out that all the causes of the war were blatantly wrong. It's all for nothing!\" In November 2004, Larry King told LCNN, \"I don't think we made the right decision to go to Iraq, but, you know, we hope to get out.\" It is clear that Trump opposed Iraq's war in its early years. However, there is no evidence that he was pre-emptive in favour of war, or that he was particularly explicit about the destabilization of the Middle East. We've reached out to the Trump campaign, and we haven't heard anything. The Governor Trump said: \"I was totally against the war in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East.\" The record at best shows some early reservations about the war, which evolved into opposition about a year after the war began. However, we find no evidence to warn Trump of regional instability before or after the war. We assess this statement wrongly. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/01b4081f-4ac9-4ced-a88f-2f6a73cea571", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05039"}
