Some are not even from a fire event.\nWe fact-checked several of the photos in the post, including this viral photo of a tiger on fire that was taken in 2012 in Jakarta, Indonesia. It depicted a bonfire of taxidermy animals.\nThe multi-photo post that included that image has been shared over 84,000 times since Jan. 4 and displays 29 photos showing animals surrounded by smoke or fire, with the caption, \"Huge wildfire in Australia has resulted in deaths of more than 480 milion animals. Hundred of rare koalas are also reported dead among them. Lets pray for Australia Source: University of sydney report #wildfire.\"\u00a0\nThe University of Sydney estimated on Jan. 3 that 480 million animals have been killed in the New South Wales bushfires since September 2019.\nThe post containing this photo gallery was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

(Note to readers that many of these images are disturbing.)\nAn image of a horse being pulled through a smoky field was taken by photographer \u00c9tienne Laurent on Oct. 30, 2019, in Simi Valley, California. Horses were being pulled by ranchers to evacuate a burning ranch as the Easy Fire spread.\u00a0\nA photo of a deer standing near a burned residence shows the aftermath of the Camp Fire that tore through Paradise, California. The photo was taken on Nov. 10, 2018, by photographer Josh Edelson. (Another image of a deer in the post wasn\u2019t taken during a fire event and was found on Adobe Stock Images, titled \"Red Deer in morning Sun.\")\nAn image of a burned cat was also taken in Paradise, California, showing destruction from the Camp Fire. Photojournalist Jane Tyska took the photograph on Nov. 11, 2018.\u00a0\nA photo of a group of burned sheep lying dead in a field was taken in Australia, but it was taken in January 2013 in a New South Wales field after bushfires swept through the area.\nWe found that a few of the other photos were taken in Australia more recently, in September 2019, but several more date back multiple years.\u00a0\nThough this viral post contains a smattering of images that are legitimately connected to the current wildfires devastating Australia, it appears an overwhelming number of those depicted here are not.
