Now, a group of Republican legislators say they want to change the dynamics by divorcing the rest of the state from its largest cities. In February, Brad Halbrook of Shelbyville, South Decatur, introduced the decision of the House of Representatives, which, if adopted, \"urges the United States Congress to take action to declare Chicago City 51 of the United States of America and separate it from the rest of Illinois.\" In an attempt to raise his case, the Halbrook decision reiterates an appalling claim that the city receives more than its fair share of State support. \"Chicago City is often rescued by taxpayers in the rest of the country, like $221 million saved by a pension system signed into law,\" she says. Previously on Goff... Bruce Ronner filed a similar claim in 2017 when he and the legislators were fighting against a plan to reform the way the State funded public schools. Although he eventually approved the plan, Ronner said that while it contained \"cancellation\" of public schools in Chicago, in part because it included $221 million to help the institution cover the employer's share of the costs of teachers' pensions. We assessed Ronner &apos; s claim as false, noting that the State has long supported the costs of teachers &apos; pensions in each other &apos; s Illinois schools with the exception of Chicago. Halbrook's decision goes even further by opposing the state is \"most likely\" to bill out of Chicago for financial restrictions at the expense of taxpayers in Down State. That's too long, and the facts aren't even close to retreating. We have contacted Halbrook, but he has not referred to any other cases he has seen of outside retirement assistance, as well as other aspects of the State School Funding Act that he believes give the largest school district in Illinois \"excess money.\" We have therefore contacted eminent experts in the political and economic history of the State to see what they have made of his claim. \"It is clearly not true in any fact-checking [sense],\" said John Jackson, an honorary professor at the University of South Illinois in Carbondale. \"It's a very popular demand in the lower Illinois, and the more you go south, the more determined you are.\" Jackson, also a visiting professor at the Paul Simon Institute of Public Policy, co-authored last year &apos; s report, which lies such allegations. It was found that Cook County, which is home to both Chicago and 40 percent of the state population, receives 90 cents again for every dollar you send to Springfield. On the other hand, the middle of Illinois receives $1.87 per dollar generated. The southern region of the state gets $2.81 for that amount. However, the majority of the people in Down State believe that they are getting a short end of the stick in a state controlled by politicians from Chicago, as reported. Historically, these complaints have sometimes focused on transport financing, which was not included in the economic analysis carried out by Jackson. * Decades ago, the residents of Western Illinois called their area \"Forgotonia,\" and one law clerk from that area wandering around in the famous State Halls. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 On 26 January 2021, a sponsor of Halbrook raised the claim that Chicago received a disproportionate share of road repair and construction funds. However, no concrete evidence has been provided to support this assertion, and nothing has been found to indicate that transport financing may reverse the distribution balance shown in the Institute &apos; s report. Furthermore, other experts with whom we spoke described Halbrook's claim as \"total nonsense\" and \"disputably justified in any kind of fact.\" Someone even called it a legend. \"I think it's very unfortunate that these politicians continue to preach to mythology,\" said Mike Lawrence, former director of the Paul Simon Institute, who served as press secretary and senior political adviser to the government. Jim Edgar, a Republican from Down State who led Illinois for most of the 1990s. \"They talk about urban legends, and there may be something like rural legends as well.\" Lawrence added: \"This does not mean that every penny goes to Chicago is justified.\" \"This also doesn't mean that every penny goes to Downstate is justified. In general, however, the power of the State to provide education and other services to the people of the state depends on all sectors of the State.\" Even one of Halbrook's sponsors would not go so far as to defend the idea that Chicago regularly receives State bailouts. \"This was more than symbolic of co-sponsorship for me,\" said the state republic C.D. Davidsmeyer from Jacksonville, Assistant President of the Republican House of Representatives. \"I didn't write it. If I had written it, I would have written it a little differently because I believe that facts and reality matter.\" Davidsmeyer, however, said that he thinks the legislator needs to have a serious conversation about \"policies on Chicago style that keep moving down on the rest of the state.\" In fact, the resolution highlights the very different positions taken by many voters in Chicago and Downstate on issues of hot buttons such as abortion, immigration and firearms regulation, none of which has anything to do with the economy or rescue. The ruling Halbrook decision claims that \"the city of Chicago is often rescued by taxpayers in the rest of the state,\" referring to funding received by the institution in 2017 to help cover its pension costs. We have previously evaluated a similar claim for error because the measure provided only financial support to the public service which the State has long offered to all other provinces in the state except Chicago. Halbrook also raised the bet by arguing money for CBS was not an isolated incident, as it was a case of \"often\" throwing a lifeline at taxpayers in Chicago at the expense of those living in Downstate. However, no evidence was provided, and academic research found the opposite to be true. The experts we talked to summarized the claim of sheep, \"It's clearly not true\" and \"Too nonsense.\" We have a classification of the allegations that fit this description: pants on fire!
