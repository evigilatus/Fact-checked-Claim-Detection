Paul Ryan\u2019s \"Path to Prosperity\" budget in 2012. That claim was named the 2011 \"Lie of the Year\" by Politifact National.\n\nOn Oct. 17, 2012, we rated an \"end Medicare\" claim by Ryan congressional opponent Rob Zerban as Pants on Fire.\n\nMedicare would still exist under various versions of Ryan\u2019s entitlement plans, though it would move toward a voucher-style system giving beneficiaries a choice of receiving a fixed government subsidy toward a private insurance plan, or for a plan similar to traditional Medicare.\n\nBut what about the claim that Thompson supports \"privatizing Social Security\"?\n\nA footnote in the ad pointed us to a March 21, 2012 Fox6 TV online story. The story quoted Thompson during the GOP Senate primary, reacting to Ryan\u2019s budget proposal by saying the \"next U.S. senator will have to take tough votes to reform programs.\"\n\nThompson mentioned Medicare and its looming insolvency, but not Social Security.\n\nSo that certainly does not support the claim by the group.\n\nWhen we asked for further backup, Workers\u2019 Voice spokesman Eddie Vale said the evidence is that Thompson backs the Ryan budget plan. And he said that Ryan\u2019s 2012 budget proposal included privatizing Social Security.\n\nActually, it didn\u2019t.\n\nWe re-read Ryan\u2019s \"Path to Prosperity\" budget documents. The plan listed there calls for action on keeping Social Security solvent, but it doesn\u2019t endorse any particular approach, including \"privatization.\"\n\nWe went back to Vale, who this time said that he meant Ryan\u2019s separate, earlier proposal, \"A Roadmap for America\u2019s Future.\"\n\nThat was issued in 2010, well before Thompson launched his Senate bid and later endorsed Ryan\u2019s Path to Prosperity budget proposal. That proposal did include provisions critics have termed \"privatization,\" as did Ryan proposals in 2004, 2005 and 2007.\n\nThis is the 2010 \"Roadmap\" proposal to make Social Security sustainable for the long term:\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffers workers under 55 the option of investing over one-third of their current Social Security taxes into personal retirement accounts, similar to the Thrift Savings Plan available to federal employees. Includes a property right so they can pass on these assets to their heirs, and a guarantee that individuals will not lose a dollar they contribute to their accounts, even after inflation.\n\nMakes the program permanently solvent \u2013 according to the Congressional Budget Office \u2013 by combining a more realistic measure of growth in Social Security\u2019s initial benefits, with an eventual modernization of the retirement age.\n\nPreserves the existing Social Security program for those 55 or older.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nVale said those \"personal retirement accounts\" noted in Ryan\u2019s 2010 plan are behind the campaign flier\u2019s accusation of Thompson supporting \"privatizing Social Security.\"\n\nBut he offered no evidence that Thompson endorsed the Ryan plan from 2010 or his earlier versions with privatization concepts in them.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any either.\n\nThe Ryan \"Path to Prosperity\" budget dropped all mentions of potential privatization, because as PolitiFact noted, he wanted to minimize the chance that Democrats would attack his plan and scotch a chance for a bipartisan deal reforming Social Security.\n\nRyan, the GOP vice presidential nominee, still favors giving younger Americans a choice of investing on their own within Social Security, as he pointed out in the October 2012 debate with Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBut the claim we\u2019re evaluating is about Thompson.\n\nLet\u2019s dig deeper.\n\nThompson has long said Social Security will need reforms to save it, though in the 2012 campaign as emphasized it will not start to \"go broke\" until 2038, long after Medicare is scheduled to run into trouble.\n\nHis campaign website praises Ryan\u2019s 2012 budget plan, which Thompson\u2019s site says \"makes Social Security solvent\" -- though, as we noted, it does not explain how.\n\nThe only Social Security-related proposal we could find by Thompson in the campaign was his repeal of federal taxation on Social Security benefits. Thompson\u2019s website says, \"he will make the repeal budget-neutral by adjusting benefit costs for high-income individuals \u2026 The result will be that most Social Security beneficiaries will see reduced income taxes on the money that was theirs in the first place.\"\n\nThompson served under President George W. Bush as secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001 through 2004, a time when Bush was developing a proposal to carve out optional private accounts from Social Security.\n\nOur search of media accounts found that Thompson was occasionally mentioned in news accounts as involved in helping Bush promote the idea -- something that did not win approval.\n\nNationally, Democrats cite an Oct. 30, 2004, Thompson speech on behalf of Bush\u2019s re-election covered by the Dubuque Telegraph Herald as evidence Thompson backed such accounts.\n\nHere\u2019s the newspaper\u2019s account:\n\nAs America's population gets older, there will have to be changes in Medicare and Social Security to keep the programs solvent, he said. In addition to living healthier lives, people should be setting up private retirement accounts and investing in long-term care policies.\n\n\"Americans have to start taking responsibility for ourselves,\" Thompson said.\n\nSo, Thompson used the term \"private retirement accounts.\"\n\nBut taken with \"investing in long-term care policies\" and \"taking responsibility for ourselves,\" it\u2019s far from clear he meant people should be allowed to divert their Social Security taxes into private accounts. Based on the wording alone, he may have meant people should set up IRAs and similar accounts with their own savings -- beyond any Social Security payments.\n\n We asked Thompson to discuss his views on Social Security private accounts, past and present. We did not hear back. (His opponent in the Senate race, Democrat Tammy Baldwin, opposes private accounts and says Social Security should be \"off the table\" in deficit-reduction talks.)\n\nOne last point: the AFL-CIO flier flatly describes private accounts as \"privatization,\" but it is partial privatization at the most. PolitiFact National gave President Barack Obama a Mostly False in 2010 when he said Republicans were pushing \"privatizing Social Security,\" saying it was a scare tactic by Democrats.\n\nOur rating\n\nThe AFL-CIO\u2019s political arm, Workers\u2019 Voice, distributed literature saying that Thompson supports a plan that includes \"privatizing Social Security.\" The union cited two plans. But the 2012 plan included no mention of privatizing Social Security. And we could find no evidence Thompson backed the 2010 plan or the earlier ones.\n\nThompson promoted Bush\u2019s ideas on privatization as a member of his cabinet until 2004.\n\nBut that circumstantial evidence, no matter how suggestive, doesn\u2019t help prove this very specific claim that Thompson endorsed a Ryan plan that touted private accounts.\n\nBased on what we know now, we rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10090"}
