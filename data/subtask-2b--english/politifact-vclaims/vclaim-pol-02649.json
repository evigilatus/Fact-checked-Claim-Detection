Jones would be a disaster!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2017\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet is chock-full of potential claims. Given Republican lawmakers\u2019 urgent push to pass a tax bill, we decided to focus on his claim that Jones wants to raise taxes.\nJones supports tax cuts for corporations, middle class\nNo, Jones has not campaigned on a platform of raising taxes.\nWe did not find examples of Jones calling for tax hikes, and the White House did not respond to our request for supporting evidence.\nJones has embraced some elements of the Republican tax plan while appearing to oppose it overall.\nJones told Alabama voters that unlike some Democrats, he favors lowering corporate taxes and believes it would make American business more competitive, according to the Washington Post\u2019s coverage of a Nov. 21 candidate forum in Huntsville.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I generally try to support cutting corporate taxes to try to get reinvestment back into this country,\" Jones told reporters Nov. 16, the day the House passed its version of the tax plan. (We\u2019ve previously reported that around $2.8 trillion in untaxed corporate earnings is parked overseas.)\nDespite his support for a corporate tax cut, Jones has criticized the GOP tax plan as fiscally irresponsible, and skewing too heavily in favor of the rich while either ignoring or hurting the middle class.\n\"What I have said all along is that I am troubled by tax breaks for the wealthy, which seem to be, in this bill, overloaded,\" Jones told reporters Nov. 16. \"I'm troubled by what appears to be, ultimately, tax increases or no tax cuts for the middle class.\"\nNeedless to say, Jones\u2019 support for cutting the corporate tax rate, and his concern for giving tax breaks to the middle class \u2014 or at least not raising their taxes \u2014 is at odds with Trump\u2019s claim.\nWould Jones support a tax hike on wealthy Americans?\nAt the same time, Jones\u2019 campaign literature, which bemoans tax breaks and loopholes for wealthy Americans, raises the question of whether Jones wants to end these benefits, effectively hiking taxes on the rich.\n\"All Americans should have a place in this economy,\" reads Jones\u2019 campaign website, \"and tax breaks or loopholes for the wealthiest among us hurt our ability to invest in education and other needs for lower to moderate income families.\"\nJones' website also calls for government spending on education and job training, and defends the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, which was financed through tax hikes.\nJones\u2019 campaign declined to answer our questions about whether Jones would support raising taxes and how he would pay for the programs he champions.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Jones wants to \"raise taxes.\"\nWhile Jones has criticized tax breaks for the rich, we found no examples of him calling to raise taxes. On the contrary, we found several instances of Jones supporting tax cuts for corporations and the middle class.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-11-28 16:44:31 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Says Alabama Senate candidate Doug Jones \"wants to raise taxes.\"    Donald Trump President https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/934781939088629761   Twitter Sunday, November 26, 2017 2017-11-26    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02649"}
