(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nFirst of all, China already has a COVID-19 vaccine.\u00a0\nIn late November, the chair of a Chinese pharmaceutical company said in an interview with a Chinese newspaper that nearly 1 million people in the country had used its COVID-19 vaccines.\nBut experts have also credited the country for curbing the spread of the coronavirus by taking other measures. In a nutshell: China moved quickly compared to other countries. Wuhan, where the first case was reported in December 2019, was put on a strict lockdown for more than two months and 9 million people were tested for COVID-19 there within weeks. Public transportation was suspended and across the country 14,000 health checkpoints were established. Residents were severely restricted from moving outside their homes. And China effectively enacted a nationwide contact tracing system.\nBy September, the executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s health emergencies program was congratulating the Chinese for working \"together tirelessly to bring the disease to this very low level.\"\u00a0\nIn October, The Lancet medical journal reported that China had managed to control the pandemic rapidly and effectively. The journal credited that feat to a few factors. The country already has a centralized epidemic response system. Few elderly Chinese residents live in nursing facilities, which were a major source of infection in some western countries. And because of the severity of the SARS outbreak in 2002, most adults there were cognizant of what could happen during the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nChinese residents also broadly complied with mask rules unlike in the United States, where many Americans have refused to wear masks even as cases surge. In China, people were publicly shamed for not wearing masks.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Drones equipped with echoing loudspeakers rebuked Chinese citizens who were not following the rules,\" according to the Lancet. \"\u2018Yes Auntie, this drone is talking to you,\u2019 one device proclaimed to a surprised woman in Inner Mongolia. \u2018You shouldn\u2019t walk around without wearing a mask. You\u2019d better go home and wash your hands.\u2019\"\nWhile restrictions in China are now similar to those in place throughout Europe and the United States, NBC News reported, widespread compliance in China appears to be making a difference.\nAs of Dec. 3, China had 93,203 cases and 4,744 COVID-19 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. That\u2019s far fewer cases and deaths than in the United States, which has recorded more than 14 million cases and more than 275,250 deaths.\u00a0\nAli Mokdad, a professor of global health at the University of Washington, told NBC that China\u2019s success is possible only through restrictions on individual freedoms that wouldn\u2019t be tolerated here. Its approach has been criticized for being draconian.\u00a0\nBut the country is still grappling with COVID-19. After multiple locally-transmitted cases were identified in three cities in November, Chinese officials tested millions of people for the disease and initiated new lockdowns and shuttered schools.\n\"Recent flareups have shown that there is still a risk of the virus returning, despite being largely controlled in China,\" the Associated Press reported.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe National Health Commission in China recently announced that \"strict containment measures should be taken\" in the winter and spring to prevent cases of COVID-19.\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post says that China has recovered from the coronavirus without a vaccine.\u00a0\nThrough a number of severe restrictions, widespread testing, and high compliance among residents there, the country has largely succeeded in bringing the virus to heel but it has not returned to normal operations. In schools, for example, millions of children wear masks and have their temperature checked multiple times a day. And new cases of COVID-19 are still being identified in China.\u00a0\nThe country also has a vaccine, and Chinese officials say nearly 1 million people have been vaccinated.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17241"}
