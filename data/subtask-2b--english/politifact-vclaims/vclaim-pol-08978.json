Ron Kind says increases in health care spending are at record lows", "text": "On Aug. 2, 2013, when House Republicans staged their 40th vote to do away with all or part of Obamacare, Rep. Ron Kind rose to defend President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark legislation.\n\"Mr. Speaker, what turned out to be a silly exercise has suddenly turned into an insane exercise. We find ourselves, for the 40th time in the House of Representatives, debating repeal of the Affordable Care Act,\" the Wisconsin Democrat said on the House floor.\n\"We understand they don't like it. But I beseech my colleagues on the other side to start working with us to improve a system that's in desperate need of reform, and make changes and adjustments along the way as we learn what's working and what isn't. That's the only way this can work.\"\nThen Kind, who took the microphone after Rep. James Bridenstine, R-Okla., made this claim:\n\"But let me just inject a few facts in this debate, especially for the benefit of the previous speaker. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, U.S. health care spending grew at 3.9 percent for the last three years, the lowest growth rate in over 50 years.\"\nLet\u2019s see whether Kind is right on the numbers -- and to what extent Obamacare is responsible.\nThe numbers\nThe most recent federal figures, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, show total public and private health care spending grew by the same rate -- 3.9 percent -- for three straight years: 2009, 2010 and 2011.\nKind's spokesman, Peter Knudsen, confirmed to us that those were the years Kind was referring to when he spoke of \"the last three years.\"\nThe 3.9 percent is the smallest annual increase since 1960, the first year total health care spending statistics were kept. The total spending has never declined from one year to the next.\nThat means Kind is mostly on target with the statistical part of his statement.\nWhere he\u2019s off is that the 3.9 percent increase in 2009 occurred before the Affordable Care Act became law in March 2010.\nNow let\u2019s turn to the other part of the statement: Kind's linking Obamacare with the record-low increases in health care spending.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe credit\nKind didn\u2019t explicitly state that Obamacare alone is responsible for keeping a lid on spending on doctors, hospitals and other health care.\nHis spokesman told us that Kind meant that Obamacare was merely one of many factors.\nBut the implication was pretty strong. In defending Obamacare from a repeal attempt, Kind said that since the passage of the law, health care spending had been much lower. And he didn't cite any other reasons.\nWe found widespread agreement among experts that many factors helped hold down the spending growth. And there is no consensus that Obamacare, which is still being implemented, was a leading factor.\nThe experts who have weighed in on reasons for the smaller increases in spending include the American Medical Association, the Health Affairs journal and the federal government itself.\nSome experts have said Obamacare has helped rein in spending through steps such as reducing some Medicare Advantage payments; providing incentives that have led to fewer hospital-acquired infections and readmissions; and adding \"accountable care organizations,\" which give physicians incentives to improve quality and lower costs.\nBut many economists and others experts say the slowdown in health care spending simply reflects the overall economic slowdown.\nOther factors include expert cite for the slowdown in health care spending increases include a decline in private insurance coverage, changes in the design of insurance benefits, and a slower introduction of new drugs and technology.\nAnd when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the total health care spending figures for 2011, the agency concluded that Obamacare had \"no discernible impact\" on the slowdown in spending that year.\nOur rating\nDefending Obamacare, Kind said: \"Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, U.S. health care spending grew at 3.9 percent for the last three years, the lowest growth rate in over 50 years.\"\nThe statistical part of the claim is mostly accurate. But despite Kind\u2019s implication that Obamacare was key in reducing the growth of health care spending, the evidence suggests its role was modest.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Kind a Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08978"}
