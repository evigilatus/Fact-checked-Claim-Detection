Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, in a Nov. 15, 2020 appearance on WISN-TV\u2019s \"UpFront\" program.\u00a0\n\"We heard from the Department of Homeland Security this week that this was probably the most secure election that\u2019s ever been run in the United States,\" Baldwin said.\u00a0\nIs it true that some of the nation\u2019s own top cybersecurity experts disagree with Trump?\nYes. Let\u2019s take a look.\u00a0\nDepartment\u2019s elections council released statement\u00a0\nOn Nov. 12, 2020, officials from two Department of Homeland Security committees \u2014 the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council and the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council overseeing cybersecurity \u2014 released a joint statement debunking their own boss\u2019s rampant misinformation campaign.\n\"The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history,\" the statement says.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s normal for states with close contests to launch ballot recounts to allow for correction of mistakes, the statement also says, but adds there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised.\u00a0\n\"While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too,\" the statement concludes.\nTrump has pointedly refused to concede to Biden, and his administration has blocked typical transition measures aimed at a smooth transfer of power.\nAnd on Nov. 17, Trump fired Christopher Krebs, the senior cybersecurity official responsible for securing the presidential election. Krebs, a Trump appointee,\u00a0has\u00a0been among the loudest\u00a0voices rebutting false claims of election fraud. In a tweet firing Krebs, Trump said Krebs' statements have been \"highly inaccurate,\" reiterating allegations of voter fraud.\nHis unsubstantiated claims of fraud have prompted several prominent Republicans to call for investigations into election proceedings, including in Wisconsin, where the GOP-controlled Legislature will launch a probe into the election, which went to Biden by about 20,000 votes.\nTrump has pledged to seek a recount in Wisconsin, though the top Republican in the Assembly has acknowledged it\u2019s unlikely to change the outcome. The deadline to seek a recount \u2014 which election officials say could cost Trump\u2019s campaign nearly $8 million \u2014 is Wednesday, Nov. 18.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nBaldwin claimed federal security officials called the Nov. 3, 2020 election the most secure in the country\u2019s history.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s correct. The groups did so in direct conflict with what the president has been falsely claiming for weeks.\u00a0\nWe rate Baldwin\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18534"}
