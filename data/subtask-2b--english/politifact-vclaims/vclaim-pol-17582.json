His re-election campaign has made similar claims, which experts debunked.\nTrump\u2019s recent claim that he \"saved\" that guarantee of coverage adds a new twist, though. We contacted the White House to find out the basis for this statement.\nJudd Deere, a White House spokesman, told us, \"President Trump has repeatedly stated his commitment to protect individuals with preexisting conditions and his track record shows that he has consistently done what is necessary to improve care for the vulnerable.\" Deere also pointed us to a range of other policy initiatives \u2013 such as efforts on kidney health, approving generic drugs and loosening restrictions on short-term health plans.\nBut none of those addressed the basis of Trump\u2019s tweet.\nThe health policy experts we consulted, however, were unambiguous: The president\u2019s claim has no factual basis and flies in the face of his ongoing policy efforts.\n\"I feel like we\u2019re being gas-lit,\" said Linda Blumberg, a health economist at the Urban Institute. \"You can\u2019t tell me you\u2019re the savior of people with preexisting conditions when every single thing you\u2019ve said or done is the opposite of that.\" (Gaslighting means manipulating the telling of events in such a way it leads people to question their recollections.)\nThis skepticism persisted across the political spectrum.\n\"That\u2019s a rather extended version of aspirational rhetoric short of any evidence,\" said Tom Miller, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\nThe preexisting condition protection\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, health insurance plans cannot charge people higher prices because they have a medical condition. This protection has been intact since the law took effect, under then-President Barack Obama.\nAs a 2016 candidate, Trump promised to repeal and replace the health law. That came to a head in 2017, when the law came within one vote in the Senate of being undone.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"That tweet is part fantasy, part delusion, part politics, and all lie,\" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. \"The president is lying about preexisting conditions. He supported, and continues to support, efforts to repeal the ACA that would take those consumer protections away.\"\nAfter that effort, Blumberg said, the president boasted that he had dismantled Obamacare \u2013 which is not only untrue, but, she added, confused many consumers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, the president has maintained his desire to undo the ACA and replace it with something new.\nNeither his administration nor congressional Republicans have yet offered a replacement plan. None of the bills they have endorsed would maintain the guarantees of coverage for people with medical problems.\n\"By supporting repeal of the ACA, they\u2019re supporting repeal of protecting preexisting condition prohibitions,\" Robert Berenson, another analyst at the Urban Institute, previously told us.\nTexas v. Azar\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration\u2019s work elsewhere could undo the\u00a0 protection.\nA group of Republican-led states are suing to have the entire ACA dismantled. Their argument stems from a law Trump signed: the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nThat law gutted the individual mandate \u2013 the ACA\u2019s requirement that everyone have coverage or pay a penalty \u2013 by reducing the penalty to $0.\nIn this case, known as Texas vs. Azar, the Republican states are arguing that the individual mandate was central to the ACA, and that without it, the entire law must be taken down. That would include the protections for people with preexisting conditions.\nThe administration has declined to defend the law in court, a move legal analysts have called almost unprecedented. The case is widely expected to\u00a0 go to the Supreme Court. Since the White House has unveiled no replacement, striking the law would leave a policy vacuum, allowing health plans to revert to discriminating against people with medical issues.\nMiller argued that the still-pending court case and previous repeal efforts don\u2019t necessarily mean there\u2019s any imminent threat of the president gutting the ACA\u2019s preexisting condition protections.\n\"For pure public opinion purposes, you want to say you\u2019re protecting against preexisting condition protections,\" Miller said. \"Does he know how to do it? No. Is he doing anything trying to change it? Not really.\"\nBut others noted that the administration\u2019s stance is firmly against maintaining the ACA\u2019s prohibitions.\n\"The Democrats have correctly said the Trump administration has in fact opposed protections for preexisting conditions by endorsing the lawsuit,\" Berenson said.\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted that he \"was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your healthcare.\"\nThe president had nothing to do with the ban on health insurance plans discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. This consumer protection is a core part of the health care law that became law during the Obama presidency. Trump has expressly supported the repeal of this law without offering a replacement that would keep the protection intact.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd to this day, his administration is arguing in court that the law \u2013 including this provision \u2013 should be undone.\nThe president\u2019s tweet is not only untrue, but it misrepresents his administration\u2019s efforts to repeal the health care law without offering any replacement that might maintain its core protections.
