When she was on the campaign trail, though, she did make comments that drew the attention of her opponent, now Gov. Brian Kemp. On Oct. 16, Abrams told a crowd that she wanted to \"create lots of different jobs,\" according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"Because people shouldn\u2019t have to go into agriculture or hospitality in Georgia to make a living. Why not create renewable energy jobs?\"\nAn attack ad later featured a clip of Abrams making the remarks, and Kemp\u2019s camp called them \"brash and condescending.\" In response to the criticism, Abrams tweeted: \"To be clear, my point is that we must continue to diversify our economy and raise wages across the board. Agriculture and hospitality are vital sectors of our economy in Georgia - but we can do more and lead in new sectors as well.\"\nShe did not ever appear to clarify a statement on \"who needs agriculture when you can just get food at the store\" because, as best we can tell, she never said it.\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-02-07 18:15:51 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Stacey Abrams said \"Who needs agriculture when you can just get food at the store?\"    Viral image On the internet     Saturday, January 5, 2019 2019-01-05    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01051"}
