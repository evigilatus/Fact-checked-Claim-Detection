He quit first.", "text": "Former President Richard Nixon returns this time as congressional Democrats prosecuting President Donald Trump. Only this week, the Judicial Committee of the House of Representatives heard testimony on the final report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller of former White House lawyer Nixon, John Dean, a key witness in the Watergate scandal. What is often forgotten about Nixon is that while he is the only American President who has resigned from his post, he has never been isolated. The last public figure to buzz in this fact was Jimmy Kimmel, an EBC host late at night, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\" Kimmel's comment came during the June 6 episode of his show, as part of a long joke breaking Trump's recent runner with Pete Medler. The comedian listed several distant links between Trump and Nixon and the 1993 Midler film \"Hox Pokus\" as evidence of why Trump ejected them on Twitter. He said, \"Richard Nixon was the last president to be isolated by \"the chase of magic,\" at some point. We found a funny kimmel joke, but it also deserves to check the facts. Our conclusion: Kimmel was wrong in a few ways, and history deserves to be reviewed. For starters, Nixon wasn't the last president to face the prospect of isolation. That was Bill Clinton. He was removed by the House of Representatives in 1998, but eventually acquitted by the Senate. On January 13, 2021, in statements broadcast by CNN, the second presidential accusation against Donald Trump was \"most isolated between the two parties in American history.\" By Louis Jacobson on January 13, 2021, and, more importantly, Nixon was never separated from him. The accusation requires a formal vote, and the Council voted only to dismiss two Presidents - Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Clinton more than 100 years later. (Johnson has also been acquitted) Nixon's story was different. In the Nixon case, the Judicial Committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved three dismissals in July 1974 and informed the plenary of the Council for its consideration. However, after the Supreme Court forced him to launch the White House criminalization tapes, Nixon resigned in August 1974, leaving his post before the Council could vote for isolation. However, it was widely believed at the time that Nixon would have been expelled if he had stayed around. Kane Hughes, a historian at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia and an expert in Nixon's undercover records, said. Timothy Navtali, Professor of Public Service at the University of New York and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, added that the dismissal \"with an overwhelming majority of the two parties was indisputable\" and \"as close as possible to the inevitable.\" A spokesman for Jimmy Kimmel Live did not respond to the requests for comments. Kimmel said Governor Richard Nixon was the last president to be isolated by a magic chase. Nixon might have been expelled if he hadn't quit first, and the process of isolation against him had begun. But only two presidents were isolated, and Nixon wasn't one of them. He resigned before having the opportunity to vote on the insulation materials. We're assessing this statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00536"}
