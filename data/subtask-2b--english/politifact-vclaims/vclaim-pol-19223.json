The confusing move sparked outrage among lawmakers and members of the public.\nA PolitiFact reader reached out to us with a related question: Did former President Donald Trump offer to come to the Guard members\u2019 rescue, as one Facebook post claims? We didn\u2019t find evidence of that.\nThe post\u2019s claim, and an old photo\n\"Thank you, President Trump, for offering your beautiful hotel to our troops to sleep in after they were put in a car garage,\" reads the Jan. 22 post.\u00a0\nThe post included a photo of Trump, flashing both thumbs up, surrounded by more than 30 men and women wearing fatigues.\u00a0\nSebastian Gorka, a former deputy assistant to Trump in the White House, shared the photo in a Jan. 22 tweet. Alluding to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gorka wrote: \"Reports coming in that Donald Trump is allowing the National Guard troops forced by Pelosi to sleep in a carpark, to use his DC hotel, Trump International.\"\nWe rated False a claim that Democrats forced \"troops\" to sleep on the ground in a parking garage. There were conflicting statements about who requested the relocation, but no indication that Democratic lawmakers or the Biden administration played a role.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Google search of the image shows it is an official White House photo of Trump visiting Ramstein Air Base, a U.S. Air Force installation in Germany, on Dec. 26, 2018.\nNo sign Trump hotel offered\nA One America News Network report credited \"an advisor\" that it didn\u2019t name with telling the conservative cable service that Trump \"stepped in by informing the troops they could stay\" at his hotel.
