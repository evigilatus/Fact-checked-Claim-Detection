(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\"Another dead body has turned up in connection to Hillary Clinton,\" the story said. \"This time, the remains of a woman were found in a dumpster at Huma Abedin\u2019s New York apartment. Hillary has gone into hiding as Huma\u2019s neighbors told the cops they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiner\u2019s recent conviction.\"\nAuthorities did find a woman dead in the trash compartment of a New York apartment building on July 10, 2018. But allegations implicating Clinton or Abedin in the incident are uncorroborated.\nLet\u2019s take a look at what actually happened, according to credible reports detailing the tragedy.\nOn July 10, police responded to Zeckendorf Towers, an upscale apartment complex in New York. There, they \"discovered a 48-year-old female unconscious and unresponsive inside a trash compactor,\" police told the New York Post. The woman, who was later identified as building resident Lara Prychenko, was found by a maintenance worker.\nSurveillance video later showed her in a nearby elevator moments earlier, where she left her handbag before entering the hallway. Police later told reporters they believed she may have fallen down the chute while drunk.\nAbedin and her ex-husband, imprisoned former congressman Anthony Weiner, previously owned an apartment in the same complex. The former couple reportedly owned the apartment for multiple years, but listed it for rent on March 19, 2017, the same day Weiner pleaded guilty for explicit texts to a minor and Abedin filed for divorce. The listing was taken off the market days later, though it is not clear whether the apartment was sold or taken off the market for another reason.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly one person died on that day\u201d during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost news outlets referred to the building as a place that Abedin \"used to call home.\"\nRegardless, the trash compactor where the dead woman was found was commonly shared. It was not \"Abedin\u2019s dumpster,\" despite what the Mad World News story said.\nFurther, apartment residents did not tell cops and NBC \"they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiner\u2019s recent conviction.\" According to the NBC report cited in the Mad World News story, the neighbors actually \"said they initially thought the police presence had something to do with the building's famous resident, Anthony Weiner.\"\nClinton, for her part, has not actually gone into hiding. She has been active criticizing President Donald Trump and promoting her upcoming events on Twitter and Facebook. Three days after the body was discovered, she addressed a teachers union conference in Pittsburgh. She is also set to attend a festival in New York on July 21, 2018, according to her Twitter.\nThe New York Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.\nOur ruling\nA headline said, \"Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin\u2019s dumpster.\"\nA dead body turned up in the trash compactor at the same apartment building that Abedin used to call home, but we could not find any evidence that Abedin and Clinton played any role in the incident or were implicated in the police investigation.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-19 21:26:40 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin\u2019s dumpster\"    Internet Rumors Bloggers https://madworldnews.com/hillary-dead-body-huma-abedin/   in a blog Thursday, July 12, 2018 2018-07-12    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01836"}
