Kearns has called for a federal investigation into the number of deaths at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center.\n\"I was shocked to learn of these numbers from the Buffalo Psychiatric Center,\" said Kearns, a South Buffalo Democrat. \"Seventy-six deaths in three years equate to about 25 patients a year dying at this facility.\"\nKearns has an intense reason to focus on the Buffalo facility. He opposes a state plan to close the Western New York Children\u2019s Psychiatric Center in West Seneca, located in his district, and relocate its patients to the Buffalo Psychiatric Center by the end of 2018.\nThe state has said there will be a separate entrance and wing for children at the Buffalo facility, but opponents of the plan still do not want children relocated.\nKearns wants an independent investigation of the Buffalo facility before the consolidation, but the state calls that unnecessary. The state also disputes the number of deaths Kearns has cited.\nSo, who\u2019s right? Did 76 patients die at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center over three years?\nHow many died at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center?\nThe state requires facilities like the Buffalo Psychiatric Center to report the number of deaths that happened on-site and also certain deaths that happened away from the facility.\nEvery patient death \u2014 inpatient or outpatient \u2014 must be reported, whether the death is related to\u00a0treatment or not. If someone receiving outpatient treatment dies in a car crash, for example, that death would be reported.\nThe facility also must count people who die within 30 days of ending treatment, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKearns cites 76 deaths because that\u2019s the number reported between June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2016, on a document from the state Justice Center for the Protection of People With Special Needs. An advocate for children with special needs obtained the document through a Freedom of Information Law request and shared the information with Kearns.\nBut the Justice Center calls Kearns\u2019 claim inaccurate.\n\"It would be inaccurate to assume that all 76 deaths listed in this FOIL response to have \u00a0physically occurred at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center,\" the Justice Center said in a statement. \u00a0\"The information provided includes a listing of all deaths reported to the Justice Center of individuals receiving residential services at a particular facility or who had received such services within 30 days of their death.\"\nFurther, \"please be advised that we do not track where the death occurred, since a death could occur in a location that is not under the jurisdiction of the Justice Center, such as in an emergency room,\" the response said.\nThe state Office of Mental Health, which runs the Buffalo facility, confirmed in an email that 13 people died on-site at the facility in the same time period.\n\"During the time frame in question, there were 13 deaths on the Buffalo Psychiatric Center campus, all due to natural causes,\" according to a statement from the mental health agency. \u00a0\nThe 63 other deaths did not happen at the facility and could be unrelated to any treatment. The state did not have a breakdown of how many of the 63 people who died were still patients at the time of their deaths.\nOur ruling\nKearns said 76 patients died at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center between June 2013 and March 2016.\nThe number is misleading. The state Office of Mental Health confirmed 13 deaths at the facility during that time. The remaining deaths did not happen at the facility.\nWe rate his statement Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts   Politifact    6 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  There were \"76 deaths in three years\" at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center    Michael Kearns Assemblyman   Buffalo, NY Tuesday, April 11, 2017 04/11/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03439"}
