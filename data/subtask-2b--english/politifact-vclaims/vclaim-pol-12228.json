Jimmy Carter\u2019s alcoholic brother. Bill Clinton\u2019s brother\u2019s drug arrest.\n\nNow the target is President Barack Obama and his Kenyan relatives, and the person taking aim is Michele Bachmann.\n\nThe Minnesota congresswoman who is running for president mentioned Obama\u2019s family members in answering a question about immigration policy during a Republican primary debate.\n\n\"Well, I think the person who really has a problem with illegal immigration in the country is President Obama. It's his uncle and his aunt who are illegal aliens... who've been allowed to stay in this country, despite the fact that they're illegal,\" Bachmann said, according to a transcript of the Oct. 18, 2011, debate.\n\nBachmann\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond when we asked what the basis was for this claim, but stories about Obama\u2019s aunt and uncle have been in the news plenty this year.\n\nIn October 2008, the Boston Globe tracked down Zeituni Onyango, believed to be Obama\u2019s paternal aunt, living in a public housing project. Obama\u2019s presidential campaign soon confirmed their relationship. Onyango is the half-sister of Obama\u2019s late father.\n\nThen came the news, reported by the Associated Press, that Onyango had previously been ordered to leave the country by an immigration judge who denied her request, based on violence in her home country, for political asylum. That meant she was no longer in the U.S. legally. The Obama campaign responded that the candidate had no knowledge of Onyango\u2019s immigration status.\n\nWithin days, Obama was elected president.\n\nOnyango\u2019s request for asylum was reopened in December 2008, and she won a 10-month reprieve. After several more court hearings, a judge granted her asylum in May 2010. The White House said it had not intervened in the case, while critics charged that such an outcome was rare for most illegal residents.\n\nThe Globe reported later that the judge had based his decision on the fact that Onyango\u2019s immigration status had been leaked to the media, which exposed her to heightened threats of persecution in Kenya.\n\nThis year, it was an Obama uncle who made news.\n\nOnyango Obama, the brother of Zeituni Onyango and the president\u2019s late father, was arrested in August in Framingham, Mass., on a suspicion of drunk driving.\n\nThe Boston Globe, citing an arrest report, said Obama first told the officer he had not had anything to drink, then admitted to one beer and then to two beers. He failed three sobriety tests and had a blood alcohol level of .14, the paper said. The legal limit in Massachusetts is 0.08.\n\nWhen offered a phone call, the paper quoted from the report that Obama replied, \"I think I\u2019d like to call the White House.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe was also held on an immigration detainer. The Globe cited anonymous federal law enforcement sources who said immigration authorities discovered that Obama had been living and working in Massachusetts in violation of a 1992 deportation order. \"Uncle Omar,\" as the president knows him, first came to the U.S. in 1963 and enrolled in school in Cambridge, Mass., the Globe wrote.\n\nAfter being held for about two weeks, the 67-year-old Obama was released from jail with little explanation from officials. A White House spokesman said the administration expected the case to be handled like any other and that the elder Obama would not receive any special help.\n\nOne of the elder Obama\u2019s lawyers -- from the same firm who helped his sister -- said he planned to fight deportation.\n\n\"He's just been here for such a long period of time. He hasn't been to Kenya in forever. He was young when he came to the United States,\" attorney Scott Bratton told the Boston Globe.\n\nObama has pleaded not guilty in the drunken driving case, which is still pending.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBachmann said, \"I think the person who really has a problem with illegal immigration in the country is President Obama. It's his uncle and his aunt who are illegal aliens... who've been allowed to stay in this country, despite the fact that they're illegal.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that the president\u2019s aunt and uncle were both in the U.S. illegally at one time, But Zeituni Onyango was granted asylum in May 2010 and is no longer in the U.S. illegally. We rate Bachmann's statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
