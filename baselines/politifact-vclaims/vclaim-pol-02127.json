At the end of her monologue, Wolf said, \"Flint still doesn\u2019t have clean water.\"\nShe\u2019s referring to the woes of Flint, Mich., where a switch in water sources was improperly handled, leading to unsafe levels of lead in the city\u2019s water system.\nWe\u2019ve periodically checked in to see how Flint\u2019s water problems are progressing, but the last time we looked was in late 2016. So, now that Wolf has used Flint\u2019s situation as an exclamation point for her high-profile remarks, we decided to gauge whether she\u2019s right that \"Flint still doesn\u2019t have clean water.\"\nUltimately, we concluded that the reality is more nuanced than Wolf portrayed it. (We reached out to Wolf\u2019s representatives but did not hear back.)\nOrigins of the problem\nFlint is a low-income and majority African-American city beset by a decline in its manufacturing industry. The city\u2019s lead poisoning was precipitated by Gov. Rick Snyder. Snyder, a Republican, had campaigned on his managerial experience and promised to bring outside experts to transform financially languishing municipalities.\nUnder an emergency manager appointed by the state, the city ended its agreement to obtain water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and instead joined a new pipeline project, the Karegnondi Water Authority, that would draw water from Lake Huron. The move, made officially in April 2013, was done in large part to save the city millions of dollars.\nThe day after the switch was announced, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department said it would cut off service in April 2014. Since the pipeline wouldn\u2019t be ready by then, the city prepared to switch its water supply to the Flint River. However, the river water contained salts that would corrode pipes, and the right mix of corrosion inhibitors was never used.\nNot only did residents complain that their new water was foul, but it eventually became clear that lead was leaching into the water supply from the city\u2019s old pipes.\nLead is a highly toxic metal, especially for children whose bodies are still developing.\nAfter a litany of missed opportunities, the situation became a focus of the national media in the second half of 2015, prompting both emergency water distribution and a search for a longer-term solution.\nWater quality\nFlint faces two issues around its water supply: the quality of the water itself, and the effort to remove pipes that contain lead.\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at water quality.\nBy July 2016, the federal Environmental Protection Agency had found significant reductions in lead levels, as long as residents used filters that were provided free of charge. Since then, there have been further improvements.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA regulation known as the Federal Lead and Copper Rule set the safe limit for lead in water at 15 parts per billion in 90 percent of samples, using specific testing procedures. Most tests with these procedures in Flint have found that \"lead levels have fallen to legally safe levels,\" said Peggy Kahn, a University of Michigan-Flint political scientist who has closely tracked the issue.\nTests conducted in 2017 over a seven-month period by Susan J. Mastern of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Michigan State found lead levels that met the federal standard.\nMarc Edwards is a Virginia Tech environmental and water resources engineer who leads the Flint Water Study team, which helped identify the problem in the first place. His team also conducted tests in late 2017 and found lead levels below the legal threshold.\nSo there\u2019s solid evidence that Flint\u2019s water is in compliance with federal regulations. That said, no level of lead is truly safe. Even the legal lead level for water does not fully protect children\u2019s health, Kahn said, especially when there are other environmental sources of lead.\n\"There is no such thing as perfectly safe water anywhere in the U.S.,\" Edwards said. \"Even bottled water sometimes has health risks.\"\nWater delivery infrastructure\nProgress on replacing old, unsafe pipes has been slower.\nIn March 2016, Flint began to rip out and replace some of the hazardous pipes under a \"FAST Start program.\" That program continues.\nKristin Moore, a Flint city government spokeswoman, said that 6,264 pipes have been replaced as of April 18, 2018. However, an estimated 12,000 Flint residences still have lead and galvanized service lines that need to be replaced, she said.\n\"The pipe replacement work is expected to be completed by 2020,\" Moore said. \"However, the mayor is hopeful that the project can be completed even sooner.\"\nOne factor slowing the work is that \"individual home tests may vary even within the same neighborhood,\" due to differences in how the original pipes were laid, said Kimberly Saks McManaway, director of the master\u2019s of public administration program at the University of Michigan-Flint.\nSo, how safe is the water?\nThe consensus we found is that the water quality in Flint is greatly improved, but the city is not out of the woods yet.\n\"While progress indeed continues to be made in Flint, Mayor Karen Weaver has said that there are still issues that must be addressed,\" said Moore, the city spokeswoman.\nShe said residents are urged to drink water that is filtered and to keep their filters properly maintained, adding \"some with health issues or compromised immune systems may be advised by medical professionals to drink bottled water.\"\nThat said, Flint\u2019s water quality now exceeds that of other cities with old water pipes, Edwards said.\nKahn agreed that there has been \"great improvement\" compared to the worst of the crisis. However, she added that \"there are still significant safety concerns, and there is a deep level of mistrust in view of some of the recent testing results and warnings, terrible past damage, unresponsiveness, and cover-ups.\"\nOur ruling\nWolf said, \"Flint still doesn\u2019t have clean water.\"\nIn reality, testing in recent months has repeatedly shown that Flint\u2019s water meets federal standards. At the same time, the city won\u2019t be fully safe until its old pipes are all replaced, which is currently estimated to happen in 2020.\nConsiderable hurdles remain for Flint, but Wolf\u2019s statement glossed over the significant progress made in water quality since the worst of the crisis.
