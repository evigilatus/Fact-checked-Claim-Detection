No", "text": "After the Parkland school shooting, Florida lawmakers passed a so-called \"red flag\" law that aims to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed to be a threat to others or themselves.\nThe new law went into effect March 9, quickly stoking concern among people about lost freedom.\nA March 18 headline posted on the Free Thought Project said, \"It begins: Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process.\"\nThe post went on to say a man in Lighthouse Point \u2014 in Broward County, like Parkland \u2014 had his guns taken away before he was determined to be mentally unfit and before he was accused of a crime, making him the first person in the state to \"have his due process removed.\"\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat online hoaxes.\nThe post makes it seem like a man\u2019s guns were taken without reason or cause, but that leaves out important nuance about the situation. Authorities said the man voluntarily surrendered his weapons and never contested the temporary risk protection order barring him from his guns for up to a year.\nFlorida\u2019s \"risk protection law\"\nFlorida legislators moved quickly to pass SB 7026, allowing law enforcement to seek a risk protection order from a judge that would temporarily remove a person\u2019s firearm(s) for up to a year. It also bars those individuals from buying guns during that time.\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri took issue with the way the law has been portrayed in headlines. He said if a person doesn\u2019t comply with a risk protection order, then police have to file a warrant and establish probable cause to obtain the weapon.\n\"There is no seizure authority,\" Gualtieri said. \"You can ask them to comply with the risk protection order, but you can\u2019t seize a person\u2019s guns.\"\nThe law slightly amended the Baker Act, under which law enforcement officials can take someone against their will to a facility for a mental health evaluation if the person is a danger to themselves or others. Authorities can confiscate a person\u2019s guns if they pose a potential danger to themselves or have made a credible threat of violence against another person.\nBefore this change, the Baker Act didn\u2019t state whether guns should be taken or returned, except to ban guns from hospitals providing mental health services. In practice, officers would often \u2014 but not always \u2014 temporarily confiscate guns if the firearms were on the person or in plain sight during the Baker Act \"episode,\" said Martha Lenderman, an expert on the Baker Act.\nMore states added similar \"red flag\" laws this year including Washington.\nMatt Agorist, who wrote the Free Thought Project article, argued that Florida\u2019s new law allows law enforcement officers to retain guns without due process.\n\"When a person is stripped of their constitutional rights, albeit temporarily, without being given the chance to make their own case based on what can be entirely arbitrary accusations, this is the removal of due process,\" Agorist said in an email to PolitiFact Florida.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2010 in a news release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Lee Logan \u2022 February 26, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this neglects the fact that the person\u00a0in question allowed police to retain his guns at the time he was taken into custody under the Baker Act. After this, Lighthouse Point police took the necessary steps to obtain a temporary risk protection order, which a judge reviewed and signed.\nDetails about the Florida police seizing a man\u2019s handgun\nPolitiFact Florida interviewed Lighthouse Point Police Chief Ross Licata and Broward County\u2019s chief judge to get an understanding of the incident that led to a 56-year-old man losing his weapons.\nLicata said officers have had interactions with the man for years, but it wasn\u2019t until early March that his actions warranted action. (PolitiFact Florida is not naming the man because of his condition.)\nOn March 7, Lighthouse Point Police checked on the man at his condo after an anonymous person filed a complaint that he was acting strangely.\nAccording to court records, the person said the man had been seen around the community \"clutching his face and hair while arguing with himself.\" The complainant also said the man had admitted to turning off the main electrical breakers to the condo building \"to prevent them from sending electrical impulses through his body and controlling him.\"\nLicata said that this was causing a safety issue for other residents who depend on oxygen.\nDuring the police welfare check, the man said he was being targeted by one of his neighbors, who he said shape-shifts and looks like Osama bin Laden. The man was carrying a firearm in the outer pocket of his cargo pants, according to court records.\nThe man voluntarily surrendered his weapons during the welfare check, said Broward\u2019s chief administrative judge, Circuit Judge Jack Tuter. After that, police determined the man was a risk to himself and others and took him into custody under the Baker Act.\nLicata said the subject was not released from the medical center until March 21.\nBefore he was released, police petitioned the court to get a temporary ex parte order and a permanent risk protection order March 14 to retain the man\u2019s guns. (An ex parte orders allows the court to proceed temporarily without both parties present for a hearing. In this case, the man was still being held at a medical facility.)\nLaw enforcement met with the man at his condo March 21 to remove additional ammunition. One week after his release, there was a final hearing to determine if the guns and ammunition should be removed for one year.\nThe man was there. He did not contest the one-year risk protection order requested by police. Tuter signed the order preventing him from owning or purchasing guns.\nOur ruling\nA headline on the Free Thought Project said, \"Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process.\"\nThe headline and the story make it appear that Florida police arbitrarily took away a man\u2019s guns, and that\u2019s not the case. The man in question voluntarily gave his weapons to police before he was taken into custody under the Baker Act, a judge said.\nWhile the man was being treated, Lighthouse Point police followed the protocol for obtaining a temporary risk protection order, and the man did not contest the order at any point during the court proceedings.\nWith everything considered, we rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-04-04 14:11:54 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"It begins: Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process.\"\"It begins: Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process.\"    Free Thought Project website https://thefreethoughtproject.com/florida-man-guns-taken-due-process/   in a headline Sunday, March 18, 2018 2018-03-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02231"}
