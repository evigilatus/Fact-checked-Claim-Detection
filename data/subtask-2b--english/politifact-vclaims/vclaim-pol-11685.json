They take more years to get through. Why? Because they have free money,\" Gingrich said. \"I would tell students: \u2018Get through as quick as you can. Borrow as little as you can. Have a part-time job.\u2019 But that\u2019s very different from the culture that has grown up in the last 20 years.\"\n\nWe wondered whether the statistics showed that students are indeed taking longer to graduate than they did in the past. So we looked into it.\n\nWe turned to figures on post-secondary education compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics, a division of the U.S. Department of Education. As it turns out, the trend for four-year colleges is exactly the opposite.\n\nPercent of bachelor\u2019s degree-seeking students completing bachelor's degrees within four years after start, at all four-year institutions\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nStudents starting college in ...\nPercent graduating in four years\n\n\n1996\n33.7\n\n\n1997\n34.1\n\n\n1998\n34.5\n\n\n1999\n35.3\n\n\n2000\n36.1\n\n\n2001\n36.2\n\n\n2002\n39.3\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the percentage of students completing degrees within four years has actually risen incrementally in recent years. Between the graduating classes of 2000 and 2006, the percentage of students graduating in four years increased by one-sixth.\n\nSo where four-year colleges are concerned, Gingrich\u2019s comment is off the mark. But Gingrich has a point in regard to two-year institutions.\n\nPercent completing certificates or associate's degrees within 150 percent of normal time, all two-year institutions\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

On that score, he said, \"there doesn\u2019t seem to be a whole lot to write home about.\"\n\nSwanson did take issue with the general tenor of Gingrich\u2019s comments -- that you should borrow as little as you can and instead get a job if you want to increase the likelihood that you\u2019ll finish college on time.\n\n\"That seems to fly in the face of what I think is a pretty well-established finding from the research that working during college or post-secondary education tends to be detrimental in terms of completion (that is, that you\u2019re less likely to complete) and time to completion (that it takes longer),\" Swanson said. \"There may be any number of issues and problems with excessive student borrowing, but being able to borrow for college does allow students the opportunity to focus more exclusively on their school work than would probably have been the case otherwise. If you follow the don\u2019t borrow/get a job argument and play that out a bit, that sounds a lot like what happens as a matter of course in community colleges. And the completion rates there are extremely low, on the order of one-third completing within an extended timeline.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nGingrich said that students today \"take more years to get through\" college. While graduation rates are lower than experts would like them to be, it's not true that students are taking longer to graduate from four-year institutions. The percentage graduating on time at four-year colleges has actually risen consistently in recent years. The only exception to this pattern is at two-year colleges, where the percentage of students graduating within three years has fallen slightly. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/670cf7ee-39a3-41a7-9d3a-e6c3459864a0", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11685"}
