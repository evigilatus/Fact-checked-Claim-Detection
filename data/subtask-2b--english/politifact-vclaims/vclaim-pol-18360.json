The bill in question is HR 6800. Called the HEROES Act, it offered billions to state and local governments, extended an emergency loan program for small businesses, and would send Americans up to $1,200 in a second round of stimulus money. It passed the House late in the evening May 15.\nThe meme\u2019s creator was the conservative TrendingPolitics.com.\u00a0\nOn May 19, after fact-checkers participating in Facebook\u2019s fact-checking partnership flagged it as wrong, TrendingPolitics corrected its post.

That means the language of 'refusing to go to work' was inaccurate in this specific meme.\"\nSo, nothing snuck into a bill, and nothing anywhere that would keep the House in recess until July 21.\nBefore the vote on the HEROES Act, the House adopted HR 967, a resolution setting the rules for the vote. That measure said the House could adjourn \"on any legislative day during the period from May 19, 2020, through July 21, 2020.\"\nThe reposted meme was popular, drawing thousands of reactions and shares on Facebook.\nThat said, it is wrong.
