J.B.) Pritzker gave huge pay raises to his politician buddies.\u201d", "truth_label": "false", "date": "stated on June 23, 2020 in a TV ad:", "title": "Attack ad wrongly claims Pritzker hiked politicians\u2019 pay during pandemic", "text": "A new group affiliated with a national Republican opposition research organization is targeting Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker over the perennially fraught issue of lawmaker pay.\nIllinois Rising Action, a nonprofit launched in March by America Rising Squared, is out with an ad accusing Pritzker of putting the interests of politicians above those of working families during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"While voters were distracted, Pritzker gave huge pay raises to his politician buddies,\" a narrator says halfway through the 30-second spot, which includes boilerplate imagery of an envelope being passed across a table. The group has said it spent $1 million on the TV ad buy.\nThe ad cites an article published in May by a news station based in Quincy, which claimed state lawmakers \"gave themselves an $1,800 pay raise\" by including a cost-of-living increase in the budget they approved for the new fiscal year, which began July 1.\nLeaders in the Democrat-controlled General Assembly, long vocal about refusing such raises, are adamant there is no raise on the books. So we decided to check it out.\nThe budget includes $0 for lawmaker raises\nThere\u2019s an interesting history behind the way state lawmakers are compensated, a system long criticized as political cowardice.\nDecades ago, every time lawmakers wanted more taxpayer money in their personal bank accounts, they were required to pass a bill. Voting themselves pay raises in lean years was a liability come election time. So, through a series of acts in the 1980s criticized at the time as backdoor menuevers, they gave themselves an automatic cost-of-living bump each year.\nThat means the only time lawmakers need to act on their personal pay is if they want to reject their automatic raises, which they have routinely done for most of the past decade.\nBut last year a circuit court judge ruled unconstitutional the pay freezes for lawmakers passed during their terms. The longstanding maneuver was challenged in court by two former lawmakers who want their back pay. The state is appealing that judge\u2019s ruling.\nThis year \u2014 faced with that legal decision \u2014 Democratic leaders took a different approach by freezing legislator pay indirectly through their spending bill. Instead of rejecting the pay increase, they simply appropriated no money for it. It\u2019s a move experts say could face similar legal challenges from dissenting lawmakers who feel entitled to their raises.\nRepublican lawmakers are suspicious of this new tactic, which comes only a year after Pritzker signed a budget that gave legislators their first raise since 2008, hiking their base pay to more than $69,000. The governor defended that increase based on \"how hard these legislators are working.\"\nThis year, Pritzker and the General Assembly have promised no such raises, a point Pritzker reiterates in a TV spot of his own responding to Illinois Rising Action\u2019s attack.\nA future lawsuit could force payments\nSo we asked Illinois Rising Action for their evidence that lawmakers are getting a raise this year thanks to Pritzker.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKayleen Carlson, the group\u2019s executive director, referred to yet another law, passed in 2014, that made lawmaker pay a \"continuing appropriation,\" which she argues makes the $0 appropriation for raises in the budget Pritzker signed an empty gesture.\n\"Since 2014, Illinois law automatically increases state lawmakers\u2019 pay through a \u2018continuing appropriation,\u2019\" Carlson wrote in an email. \"This means that legislators who want to foreclose a pay increase must pass a bill specifically to do so.\"\nRegardless, Democratic Comptroller Susana Mendoza, the official in charge of cutting the state\u2019s checks, promises there will be no raises this fiscal year. She even released a video to underscore that message.\nExperts say the decades of political gamesmanship lawmakers have used to avoid voting for their own pay raises may be finally coming to a head.\nCharles N. Wheeler III, who has followed the General Assembly for decades as both a journalist and professor at the University of Illinois Springfield, said there is one obvious fix \u2014 go back to the politically inconvenient practice of forcing lawmakers to vote on pay increases.\nOne Republican senator proposed legislation in February to do just that, but the bill died in committee without ever coming up for a vote. Under that legislation, the fix wouldn\u2019t take effect until 2023, when lawmakers will all begin new terms.\nAs for the ad\u2019s claim, Wheeler called it \"a convenient misstatement of the facts.\"\n\"If you wanted to be more accurate, you would say the governor and the Democratic majorities failed to take the actions that would have been needed to eliminate these things going forward,\" he said. \"But that\u2019s not as effective as saying, \u2018he gave his buddies a pay raise.\u2019\"\nOur ruling\nIllinois Rising Action\u2019s ad says \"while voters were distracted, Pritzker gave huge pay raises to his politician buddies.\"\nThe group was referencing the annual cost-of-living adjustments legislators are provided with automatically under state law. For most of the past decade, legislators have passed bills rejecting those raises.\nBecause of a recent legal decision, lawmakers used a different maneuver to freeze pay this year in the budget Pritzker signed. Lawmakers have gotten no pay raise this year, and the governor made no moves designed to give them one.\nWe rate this claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2014 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17685"}
