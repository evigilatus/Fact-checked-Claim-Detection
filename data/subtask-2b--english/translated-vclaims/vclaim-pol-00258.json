Matt Gates, R. Fla, from Fox News Janine Peru, on how to prevent weapons from falling into the wrong hands. \"I'm here in Australia, Congressman. Peru stated on 10 August after the mass shooting in El Paso and Dayton, which killed 31 people. \"This is unfortunately the beginning of a unique American case. I am the owner of a weapon. I'm a strong person in the second amendment, but some wrong people put their hands on the guns.\" Gates replied: \"No one suggests that we in the United States want to dissolve Australia. That's where they went and confiscated all the guns. Do you know who did what Australia did? Venezuela. And now their people cannot resist when they have to fight on their way out of a socialist dictator.\" But no one proposed to take the weapons, and Peru responded, adding a comparison of Gaetz in Venezuela that seemed \"a little further.\" So Polly Fuck Florida wanted to look into it. The general point that Gates was trying to make, as his spokesman told us, is that he believes that arms control has failed in both Australia and Venezuela. He exchanged articles showing an Australian black arms market, for example, as well as other news stories on Venezuela &apos; s arms control laws, making civilians and even the police more vulnerable. However, there are many factual inconsistencies in his own claim concerning Australia and comparison with Venezuela. \u2022 Australia has not imposed a complete arms embargo; it has banned some weapons, including semi-automatic weapons, after a mass shooting in 1996. \u2022 This is different from what the Government of Venezuela did in 2012 and 2013, when steps were taken in an attempt to stem the flow of weapons. \u2022 In both countries, millions of rifles remain in the hands of civilians. Deaths caused by the use of weapons are a major problem in Venezuela. In 1996, 35 people were killed by gunfire in Tasmania. It was one of the most deadly mass shootings in the world at the time. The National Government, led by the governors, has moved quickly to ban and destroy some weapons. Australia prohibited semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as rifles. The Government has offered a one-year grace period during which it will buy firearms again. After that, persons in possession of weapons are subject to severe penalties. The buy-back programme seized more than 640,000 prohibited weapons - approximately one fifth of the estimated weapons in the country. Today, Australians still have a high per capita ratio of long shotguns, along with many pistols, as stated by Philip Albers, Founding Director of Gunpolicy.org, a global project of the Sydney School of Public Health. However, the number of legal and illegal weapons decreased from about 3.2 million in 1996 to 2.5 million in 1997. Since then, it has risen to almost the same number as before the embargo, although the rate of ownership of small arms is today. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Australia suffered 14 mass shootings that killed 117 people, as Albert said. After the change of the Weapons Act, there has been no mass shooting for many years. In June 2019, four people were killed by an armed man who used a prohibited weapon. In 2018, seven people were killed in murder and mass suicide within the family. The control of weapons in Venezuela, what Venezuela has done for several years, has not been like Australia. The weapon wasn't the same, for starters. In Australia, the Government responded to a mass shooting. Venezuela has faced a widespread problem of widespread armed violence and murders - and continues to do so. Bill Nelson showed on June 11, 2009, during the debate in the United States Senate, \"The truth is that any oil that will be dug can be sent to any other country in the world, In 2012, Venezuela introduced measures to prohibit the possession of weapons in public places and to stop the sale of private weapons to citizens. In 2013, President Nicholas Maduro signed a disarmament bill aimed at stemming the flow of weapons. The Act established an automated system for the registration of weapons, parts and ammunition under the control of the armed forces. Individuals were allowed to hold conditional possession, which means that the State can take their weapons. Rebecca Hanson, an expert in crime in Venezuela and now a professor at the University of Florida, said that she would not call the 2013 law \"a ban on weapons,\" because civilians could still possess weapons as long as they recorded them. Weapons also remained widely available on the black market and enforcement was lenient. \"The law, in fact, has not affected people's ability to access weapons in any effective or long-term manner,\" she said. Since most weapons are purchased on the black market, regulation of the legal market does not contribute significantly to limiting arms sales in Venezuela. Many of these weapons end up flowing from State security forces and the army to the black market. \"All this is to say that even with the 2013 law, access to weapons has increased,\" she said. Alejandro Velasco, Professor of History at New York University in Modern Latin America, told us that \"the arms embargo has had virtually no practical effect on people's ability to purchase and retain weapons (or use them). There are no fixed figures for determining the number of weapons owned by civilians in Venezuela. Gunpolicy.org estimates that there are some 5.9 million privately owned rifles in the hands of Venezuelan civilians from 2017, although its consultant said that it could be a wide range. Velasco said that the opposition movement considered itself mostly non-violent. We have been told by many experts that it is not surprising that civilians do not bring weapons to protests where they face the armed government. \"Even if disarmament law has significantly reduced the ownership of weapons, which is not clear at all, armed anti-Government civilians will have no chance against tanks and military fighter aircraft,\" said Dorothy Kronik, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Experts criticized Gates' use of problems in Venezuela for any comment on the firearms laws of the United States. \"The linkage of arms control to the fight for democracy in the Venezuelan context only contributes to the distortion of an already very distorted situation,\" said Kimer Avila, Professor of Criminology at the Central University of Venezuela, \"an increase in violence in an already extremely violent environment, and the undermining of an already precarious institution.\" Our referee, Gates, said in Australia, \"They've gone and confiscated all the weapons. Do you know who did what Australia did? Venezuela The Gates claim concerning Australia is false, and its comparison with Venezuela is flawed. After large-scale shooting in 1996, Australia banned semi-motorized rifles and self-loading rifles as well as rifles and offered to buy them back for one year. Not all weapons have been banned. The number of weapons currently owned by civilians is almost the same as before the 1996 Act, although the rate of ownership is lower. In Venezuela, the Government has taken measures to try to reduce the flow of weapons to civilians. However, experts said that most weapons were sold on the black market and that weapons were still rampant in Venezuela. The idea that private arms owners can successfully unite the national army is also unlikely. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00258"}
