0001	CHUCK TODD	This Sunday, a $353,000 ticket to a Hillary Clinton fundraiser.
0002	CHUCK TODD	My exclusive interview with the host of that event, George Clooney.
0003	CHUCK TODD	advertisement
0004	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think it's an obscene amount of money.
0005	GEORGE CLOONEY	And it's ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics.
0006	CHUCK TODD	George Clooney on Clinton, Trump, and all that money in politics.
0007	GEORGE CLOONEY	But I think there is a difference between the Koch brothers and us.
0008	CHUCK TODD	Plus, the Republican party at war with itself.
0009	DONALD TRUMP	This is a rigged system, folks.
0010	DONALD TRUMP	The Republican system is a rigged system.
0011	DONALD TRUMP	advertisement
0012	CHUCK TODD	The Trump campaign is trying to be more disciplined.
0013	CHUCK TODD	But is it too late for the candidate to change the script?
0014	CHUCK TODD	Republican chairman Reince Priebus joins me.
0015	CHUCK TODD	Also, North Carolina's new socalled "bathroom" law.
0016	CHUCK TODD	Does it discriminate against the L.G.B.T.
0017	CHUCK TODD	community?
0018	CHUCK TODD	I'll ask the governor, Pat McCrory, if he now regrets signing a bill that has cost is state so much money.
0019	CHUCK TODD	And joining me for insight and analysis are MSNBC's Chris Matthews, Kathleen Parker of The Washington Post, radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, and Perry Bacon of NBC News.
0020	CHUCK TODD	Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.
0021	ANNOUNCER	From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.
0022	CHUCK TODD	Good Sunday morning.
0023	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump got wiped out in the delegate race in yet another state yesterday.
0024	CHUCK TODD	In Wyoming, Ted Cruz won all the delegates that were up for grabs at yesterday's Wyoming state convention.
0025	CHUCK TODD	Now Trump says it would have been a waste of time and money for him to campaign there, claiming, "The system is rigged," and that the Republican establishment is simply trying to take the nomination away from him.
0026	CHUCK TODD	We're going to get to that story later in the show.
0027	CHUCK TODD	But we're going to begin with the Democrats and the intersection of money, politics, and Hollywood.
0028	CHUCK TODD	And my surprisingly frank conversation with George Clooney.
0029	CHUCK TODD	Last night in Los Angeles, and the night before in San Francisco, George and Amal Clooney hosted fundraisers for Hillary Clinton, where the top ticket sets you back $353,000.
0030	CHUCK TODD	For that price, you got to sit at the same table with Hillary Clinton and the Clooneys.
0031	CHUCK TODD	It was very much an event for the 1 percent of the 1 percent.
0032	CHUCK TODD	This bigmoney fundraiser did not escape the attention of the Bernie Sanders campaign or his supporters who last night threw dollar bills, real ones, at Clinton's motorcade.
0033	CHUCK TODD	advertisement
0034	CHUCK TODD	Sanders, of course, has made opposing Wall Street and money in politics the centerpiece of his campaign.
0035	CHUCK TODD	I got a chance yesterday to talk to George Clooney from his home outside of L.A. And he was very open and candid about what he thought about all that money that is pouring into campaigns at events like the one he hosted.
0036	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0037	CHUCK TODD	Mr. Clooney, welcome to MeetthePress.
0038	GEORGE CLOONEY	Thank you, Chuck.
0039	CHUCK TODD	Let me start with dinner you cohosted on Friday night, a big fundraiser.
0040	CHUCK TODD	I know that you have plans for later tonight.
0041	CHUCK TODD	Do you look at how much is being raised and, I think the cost of the friday night dinner $353,000 a couple to be a cochair, do you look at it yourself and think, "That's an obscene amount of money?"
0042	GEORGE CLOONEY	Yes.
0043	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think it's an obscene amount of money.
0044	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think that, you know, we had some protesters last night when we pulled up in San Francisco and they're right to protest.
0045	GEORGE CLOONEY	They're absolutely right.
0046	GEORGE CLOONEY	It is an obscene amount of money.
0047	GEORGE CLOONEY	The Sanders campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right.
0048	GEORGE CLOONEY	It's ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics.
0049	GEORGE CLOONEY	I agree completely.
0050	GEORGE CLOONEY	advertisement
0051	CHUCK TODD	You know, it was interesting.
0052	CHUCK TODD	We caught, our camera caught you having a conversation with the protesters last night.
0053	CHUCK TODD	What did you say to them?
0054	GEORGE CLOONEY	Well, it was a funny thing.
0055	GEORGE CLOONEY	I went over to try to talk to them and you said I was some corporate shill which, you know, me that's one of the funnier things you could say about me.
0056	GEORGE CLOONEY	And then he just said, you know, "You sucked as Batman."
0057	GEORGE CLOONEY	And I was like, "Well, you kind of got me on that one."
0058	GEORGE CLOONEY	And then I walked away and that was basically it.
0059	GEORGE CLOONEY	But, you know, I think what's important and what I think the Clinton campaign has not been very good at explaining is this and this is the truth the overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising, is not going to Hillary to run for President, it's going to the downticket.
0060	GEORGE CLOONEY	It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress.
0061	GEORGE CLOONEY	And the reason that's important and the reason it's important to me is because we need, I'm a Democrat so if you're a Republican, you're going to disagree but we need to take the senate back because we need to confirm the Supreme Court justice because that fifth vote on the Supreme Court can overturn Citizens United and get this obscene, ridiculous amount of money out so I never have to do a fundraiser again.
0062	GEORGE CLOONEY	And that's why I'm doing it.
0063	CHUCK TODD	So you don't enjoy doing these fundraisers?
0064	GEORGE CLOONEY	No, I don't think anybody does.
0065	GEORGE CLOONEY	I don't even think politicians do.
0066	GEORGE CLOONEY	You know, I'm sure you've covered them before.
0067	GEORGE CLOONEY	It's not the most fun thing to do.
0068	GEORGE CLOONEY	You know, I spend probably a quarter of my time now raising millions and millions of dollars to fund my foundation which is basically chasing and looking for money that these corrupt politicians all around the world are hiding.
0069	GEORGE CLOONEY	The Panama papers have been actually incredibly helpful.
0070	GEORGE CLOONEY	We have forensic accountants so this is all a very big part of things that are important to me.
0071	GEORGE CLOONEY	I really want Citizens United.
0072	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think it's the worst, one of the worst laws passed, since I've been around.
0073	CHUCK TODD	You know, Bernie Sanders, obviously you've noted that his campaign was criticizing this and he was asked about your fundraiser specifically and he tried he backed off and he said this
0074	BERNIE SANDERS	It's not a criticism of Clooney it's a criticism of corrupt campaign finance system where big money interests and it's not Clooney, it's the people who are coming to this event that end up having undue influence over the political process.
0075	CHUCK TODD	Do you think people that are coming to your event tonight and went last night, that they think they're gonna get extra access to Hillary Clinton, to a President Clinton?
0076	GEORGE CLOONEY	No.
0077	GEORGE CLOONEY	I actually don't think that's true.
0078	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think there is a difference between the Koch brothers and us, you know?
0079	GEORGE CLOONEY	The difference is if I succeed, if we succeed in electing an entire Congress which would be quite a success but a Senate and a President, you know, the tax policies that they would enact would probably cost us a lot more money quite honestly.
0080	GEORGE CLOONEY	The Koch brothers would profit if they get their way and that's what, you know, there's no profit for us in this.
0081	GEORGE CLOONEY	You know, understanding this Koch brothers have said that they're gonna spend $900 million not on the presidency but on the downticket, on the senators and the congressman and the gubernatorial races and local races.
0082	GEORGE CLOONEY	And so our job is to try and counter that in some way.
0083	CHUCK TODD	You actually have plenty of nice things to say about Bernie Sanders.
0084	CHUCK TODD	I think you did an interview with TheGuardian where you said you like the issues he was bringing up, you thought he was actually pushing Hillary Clinton in a certain way.
0085	CHUCK TODD	I am curious why did you pick Clinton over Sanders?
0086	GEORGE CLOONEY	Well, I've worked with Secretary Clinton as Secretary particularly when the Sudan and South Sudan were looking to vote for their own independence and it was an incredibly dangerous time for that country.
0087	GEORGE CLOONEY	And there were, you know, hundreds of thousands of people's lives at risk.
0088	GEORGE CLOONEY	And between the Secretary and the Security Council and some of the people on the ground and Kofi Anan and Jimmy Carter and people like that and thousands of people on the ground, we worked very hard to make sure that that didn't happen.
0089	GEORGE CLOONEY	She understood it.
0090	GEORGE CLOONEY	She understood the issues even though we don't have any great reason to pay much attention to Sudan.
0091	GEORGE CLOONEY	We don't trade with them.
0092	GEORGE CLOONEY	We don't get money from them.
0093	GEORGE CLOONEY	I found her to know, to be knowledgeable and to be and to care about the issues.
0094	GEORGE CLOONEY	And we've worked together since then and I've been a very big fan of hers.
0095	GEORGE CLOONEY	But I want to say this I really like Bernie.
0096	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think what he's saying in this election is important if you're a Democrat.
0097	GEORGE CLOONEY	Again to have these conversations, I hope he stays in for the entire election and if he were to win the nomination, I will do whatever I can including if asked a fundraiser like this again to try to give him or her, Hillary, I hope she wins a Senate because honestly we see what happens when a President tries to get their Supreme Court justice confirmed without the Senate.
0098	CHUCK TODD	You have minced no words about your feelings about Donald Trump.
0099	CHUCK TODD	I think you called him a, "xenophobic fascist."
0100	CHUCK TODD	I hope I'm quoting you correctly.
0101	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think you're pretty close.
0102	CHUCK TODD	Okay.
0103	CHUCK TODD	Fair enough.
0104	CHUCK TODD	What have your interactions been with him?
0105	CHUCK TODD	You ever have any personal interaction?
0106	GEORGE CLOONEY	I met him once.
0107	GEORGE CLOONEY	I've met him once.
0108	GEORGE CLOONEY	I was sitting down at a table and he was nice.
0109	GEORGE CLOONEY	And we talked a couple of times, I think.
0110	GEORGE CLOONEY	And then he went on Larry King and told everybody I was very short.
0111	GEORGE CLOONEY	I wish I had said "I met you sitting down."
0112	GEORGE CLOONEY	But, no.
0113	GEORGE CLOONEY	It's not about that.
0114	GEORGE CLOONEY	You know, here's the point about what's going on right now on the other side.
0115	GEORGE CLOONEY	Trump and Cruz are making this a campaign of fear.
0116	GEORGE CLOONEY	We have to be afraid of everything.
0117	GEORGE CLOONEY	We have to be afraid of refugees.
0118	GEORGE CLOONEY	We have to be afraid of Muslims.
0119	GEORGE CLOONEY	We have to be afraid of minorities.
0120	GEORGE CLOONEY	And the question is and this is an important one, are we really going to be scared of the very things that have made our country great?
0121	GEORGE CLOONEY	And if the answer is, "Yes," then we have history to answer to because we're not afraid.
0122	GEORGE CLOONEY	We are not a country that is afraid and I refuse to accept that.
0123	CHUCK TODD	Why do you think fear has been working at least in the Republican party?
0124	GEORGE CLOONEY	Because fear's always worked one way or another.
0125	GEORGE CLOONEY	In elections, fear has always been a great  one of the great tools of any election.
0126	GEORGE CLOONEY	But the reality is we are not the descendants of fearful people.
0127	GEORGE CLOONEY	We're not.
0128	GEORGE CLOONEY	So no, we're not going to ban Muslims from this country.
0129	GEORGE CLOONEY	That's never going to happen.
0130	GEORGE CLOONEY	And we're not going to go back to torture and we're not going to kill the families of terrorists or suspected terrorists because that is not who we are.
0131	GEORGE CLOONEY	And if we did, our grandparents and their parents would be ashamed of us.
0132	CHUCK TODD	I'm curious Hollywood and a lot of movie studios were very aggressive in putting pressure on the governor of Georgia to veto a bill that would have perhaps made it easier to discriminate gays and lesbians and transgender folks.
0133	CHUCK TODD	Some of that same pressure is being applied to North Carolina.
0134	CHUCK TODD	First of all do you approve of pressure like that, number one, and what do you make of the North Carolina law?
0135	GEORGE CLOONEY	Well, I'm a protester from way back.
0136	GEORGE CLOONEY	I got arrested in DC a couple years ago with my father protesting.
0137	GEORGE CLOONEY	I'm a big believer in protests.
0138	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think it matters from the '56 Montgomery bus protest to the apartheid protests that I was a part of when I was a young man.
0139	GEORGE CLOONEY	But I find these to be really effective because these are big corporations that are protesting.
0140	GEORGE CLOONEY	And when you have IBM and Walmart of all people and General Electric and people like that coming at you, it affects people.
0141	GEORGE CLOONEY	And you can see it because we saw it with Mike Pence in Indiana.
0142	GEORGE CLOONEY	We saw it with Jan Brewer in Arizona.
0143	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think they can have some great effect and I think the law is ridiculous, of course.
0144	CHUCK TODD	All right.
0145	CHUCK TODD	George Clooney, I've kept you long enough.
0146	CHUCK TODD	Thanks for coming on.
0147	CHUCK TODD	Appreciate it.
0148	GEORGE CLOONEY	Thank you, Chuck, I appreciate it.
0149	CHUCK TODD	You got it.
0150	CHUCK TODD	As you saw there, that was George Clooney, a Clinton supporter, striking an unusually conciliatory tone towards Bernie Sanders these days.
0151	CHUCK TODD	But Thursday night's debate between the candidates got pretty heated and it was not so conciliatory.
0152	SYSTEM	(BEGIN VIDEO)
0153	HILLARY CLINTON	You know, wait a minute, wait a minute, come on.
0154	BERNIE SANDERS	That's just not accurate.
0155	HILLARY CLINTON	Come on.
0156	HILLARY CLINTON	I have stood on the debate stage
0157	BERNIE SANDERS	Wolf!
0158	BERNIE SANDERS	Wolf!
0159	BERNIE SANDERS	Can I
0160	HILLARY CLINTON	with Senator Sanders eight prior times.
0161	HILLARY CLINTON	I have said the exact same thing
0162	BERNIE SANDERS	Wolf.
0163	BERNIE SANDERS	Wolf.
0164	BERNIE SANDERS	Excuse me, Wolf?
0165	WOLF BLITZER	Secretary, Senator, please.
0166	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0167	CHUCK TODD	There you go.
0168	CHUCK TODD	The New York primary is on Tuesday.
0169	CHUCK TODD	Joining me now is the chair of the Democratic party, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, as well as our panel is going to be joining in here with the questioning.
0170	CHUCK TODD	But Madam Chairman, nice to see you.
0171	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Nice to see you, too.
0172	CHUCK TODD	Let me start with what George Clooney said.
0173	CHUCK TODD	He agreed this fundraiser, which benefits a big chunk of the DNC, obscene.
0174	CHUCK TODD	Do you agree with him?
0175	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Absolutely.
0176	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	We agree as a party that there is an obscene amount of money in politics.
0177	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And that's why our members, I'm a cosponsor, along with many of my colleagues of a constitutional amendment that would overturn Citizens United.
0178	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	We need to make sure that we can keep elections that, like we did with changing congressional districting and redistricting across the country, that voters can choose their representatives and that we don't have outside undue influence come in and swoop in and, uh, make decisions on behalf of the majority of voters.
0179	CHUCK TODD	As I said, people see the panel is here.
0180	CHUCK TODD	Chris Matthews of Hardball, Kathleen Parker of The Washington Post, Perry Bacon of NBC News, Hugh Hewitt, the radio program Hugh Hewitt Show.
0181	CHUCK TODD	Chris, fire away.
0182	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Well, I think one thing Bernie Sanders is saying in his ads I don't think is true.
0183	CHRIS MATTHEWS	He's talking about members of Congress, people in Washington, taking money for speeches.
0184	CHRIS MATTHEWS	You're not allowed to do that.
0185	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Youre not allowed to do that.
0186	CHRIS MATTHEWS	You guys voted that out years ago.
0187	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	That's right.
0188	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	They're not allowed to do that.
0189	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	There are no honorariums.
0190	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And, look, the bottom line here is that we have two candidates who are at the more narrow end of the funnel now as we end the primary election contest.
0191	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And it's going to get more heated.
0192	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	But look, compared to the Republicans who are in utter chaos, our two candidates have been substantive and robust, they've kept largely to the issues that are important to the American people, talked about how they want to build on President Obama's congressional delegates, uh, congressional Democrats' legacy, and we want to move the country forward and help people reach the middle class.
0193	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And they have slightly different approaches to how to get there, but it's been a substantive discussion.
0194	CHUCK TODD	Yeah, slightly.
0195	CHUCK TODD	Okay.
0196	CHUCK TODD	Perry, go ahead.
0197	PERRY BACON	Chairman, Bernie Sanders this week has really attacked the 1990s in some ways.
0198	PERRY BACON	He says the crime bill of '94 and the welfare reform bill of 1996 were bad legislation.
0199	PERRY BACON	Do you agree with that?
0200	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	You know, I think that the impact of the crime bill has had some important effects and some detrimental effects.
0201	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And so, you know, both of our candidates voted for the crime bill.
0202	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And I think most Democrats would agree that there needs to be reforms so that we can make sure that sentencing and the way we manage our criminal justice system is a lot more equitable and fair than it is today.
0203	CHUCK TODD	Kathleen?
0204	KATHLEEN PARKER	Yeah, going back to the financing of political campaigns, everybody loves to talk about how much we dislike Citizens United, you'll find people on both sides, Republicans dislike it too, at least a lot of them do.
0205	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Certainly, but thats certainly not reflected in how they vote
0206	KATHLEEN PARKER	Well, Mitt Romney was one who spoke out about, you know, how much he disliked it because it gives so much power to people who are sort of marginal participants
0207	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	While benefiting from it handsomely.
0208	KATHLEEN PARKER	But that's not really my question.
0209	KATHLEEN PARKER	I'm just laying that out as the prefatory note.
0210	KATHLEEN PARKER	What I want to know is, is there ever any serious consideration given to a possibility of just limiting campaigns as other countries do, to two months, say?
0211	KATHLEEN PARKER	And make them completely publicly funded.
0212	KATHLEEN PARKER	Is that ever anything that gets serious consideration and would it be possible?
0213	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Only by Democrats.
0214	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	I mean, certainly, Democrats have supported public financing of campaigns, I know I do, and many of my colleagues do.
0215	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And we do need to, you know, have an effort that both sides come together, and try to make that reform.
0216	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	But Republicans have no interest in changing the campaign finance system.
0217	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	They support the hundreds of millions of dollars of outside undue influence swooping in and weighing heavily on the outcome of any election contest.
0218	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	It's obscene and we need to elect majorities in Congress so Democrats can make a difference in changing it.
0219	CHUCK TODD	Hugh, last question.
0220	HUGH HEWITT	Chairwoman, let me bring up something that did not come up in the more cowbell debate from Thursday night.
0221	HUGH HEWITT	And that is if after Lewandowski was charged, many Democrats and many Republicans said of Donald Trump's campaign manager that he should be fired, and he wasn't.
0222	HUGH HEWITT	If any of Secretary Clinton's aides are indicted in the F.B.I.
0223	HUGH HEWITT	server investigation, should they also be fired?
0224	HUGH HEWITT	Should the same standard apply?
0225	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	That is a question that I'm not even going near.
0226	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	I don't think that's going to happen.
0227	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And at the end of the day, we are going to have a campaign that will play out.
0228	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Our nominee will ultimately be elected president of the United States because we are on the side of the American people, and ultimately our candidate
0229	HUGH HEWITT	It's not about whether or not it's going to happen, it's about the standard.
0230	HUGH HEWITT	If a senior aide is ever indicted in a campaign, as Mr. Lewandowski was, should they be fired immediately?
0231	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Again, I don't think that that's going to happen.
0232	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	So it's not a question that is one that I think makes sense to answer.
0233	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	I'm focused on making sure that when we get to the end of our primary, we're preparing for the general election and we can and will elect our nominee, the 45th president of the United States.
0234	CHUCK TODD	I'm going to leave it there.
0235	CHUCK TODD	Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Madam Chairwoman.
0236	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Thank you.
0237	CHUCK TODD	Thanks for coming in.
0238	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Thanks for having me.
0239	CHUCK TODD	And coming to the table.
0240	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Absolutely.
0241	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Any time.
0242	CHUCK TODD	And I appreciate it.
0243	CHUCK TODD	All right.
0244	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Thanks.
0245	CHUCK TODD	When we come back, the Republican race.
0246	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump loses a delegate contest, and yet another state at a convention.
0247	CHUCK TODD	If he can't stop the bleeding, can he beat Ted Cruz at this summer's convention if he can't win on the first ballot?
0248	CHUCK TODD	If you want to know why Donald Trump is so frustrated with the delegate selection process, here's yet another example.
0249	CHUCK TODD	Yesterday in Wyoming, Ted Cruz, without a primary or a caucus, won all 14 delegates available at the state convention.
0250	CHUCK TODD	It means Cruz wound up with 23 pledged delegates from Wyoming with Trump and Marco Rubio each receiving just one.
0251	CHUCK TODD	So what happened in Wyoming has been typical of this campaign.
0252	CHUCK TODD	Though Trump is winning the overall battle for votes, and delegates say in primaries, he's losing the handtohand combat over delegates that are awarded at state conventions.
0253	CHUCK TODD	And as a result, Trump has ricocheted between trashing the Republican National Committee and trying to make peace with it.
0254	CHUCK TODD	And it's clear now though that Donald Trump realizes the game is about winning on the first ballot at the convention, or he's doomed.
0255	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0256	DONALD TRUMP	The Republican National Committee, they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap.
0257	CHUCK TODD	The fight between the Republican frontrunner and the Republican party, smoldering for days, is turning to an allout war.
0258	DONALD TRUMP	The system, folks, is rigged.
0259	DONALD TRUMP	It's a rigged system.
0260	DONALD TRUMP	Because it's a rigged system, folks.
0261	DONALD TRUMP	The Republican system is rigged, okay?
0262	CHUCK TODD	An onagainoffagain feud with party leaders is ratcheting up, even as Trump tries a campaign reboot.
0263	CHUCK TODD	After a crushing 13point defeat in Wisconsin, Trump turned a page, sidelining campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
0264	DONALD TRUMP	He wasn't quite as effective for the past couple of months.
0265	CHUCK TODD	Hiring a new delegate wrangler, Paul Manafort, and a political director with close ties to the R.N.C.
0266	CHUCK TODD	Reaching out to members of Congress, and limiting exposure to the media to just friendly interviews.
0267	DONALD TRUMP	When I take them out, I will be so presidentialyou won't believe it.
0268	CHUCK TODD	But even as Trump's new team attempts to keep him scripted
0269	DONALD TRUMP	Get him out.
0270	DONALD TRUMP	Don't hurt him.
0271	DONALD TRUMP	See how nice I am?
0272	DONALD TRUMP	I'm saying don't hurt him.
0273	CHUCK TODD	putting out a Wall Street Journal oped, promising to work closely with the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and top G.O.P.
0274	CHUCK TODD	officials to reform our election policy, Trump himself shows no sign of letting up.
0275	DONALD TRUMP	The Republican National Committee, they better get going.
0276	DONALD TRUMP	Because I'll tell you what, you're going to have a rough July at that convention.
0277	CHUCK TODD	But can Trump afford to alienate the party insiders he needs to unite the party and win a general election?
0278	CHUCK TODD	He's already struggling with swing voters.
0279	DONALD TRUMP	Who's going to pay for the wall?
0280	CHUCK TODD	79% of Hispanic voters now view Trump unfavorably.
0281	DONALD TRUMP	No, I'll use the word "anchor baby."
0282	DONALD TRUMP	Excuse me.
0283	DONALD TRUMP	I'll use the word "anchor baby."
0284	CHUCK TODD	So do 67 percent of suburban women, and 72 percent of moderates.
0285	MEGYN KELLY	You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.
0286	MEGYN KELLY	Your Twitter account
0287	DONALD TRUMP	Only Rosie O'Donnell.
0288	CHUCK TODD	Three years ago, after Mitt Romney's defeat, the party charted a path back to the White House that imagined a bigtent Republican party, and recommended new appeals to women and minority voters.
0289	REINCE PRIEBUS	A welcoming attitude that we need to have in our party.
0290	REINCE PRIEBUS	I think that we had some biologically stupid things that were said in the last election.
0291	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0292	CHUCK TODD	I'm joined now by the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
0293	CHUCK TODD	Chairman Priebus, welcome back to Meet the Press.
0294	REINCE PRIEBUS	Good morning.
0295	REINCE PRIEBUS	Thank you.
0296	CHUCK TODD	Let me start with your Republican frontrunner continually calling the process that you're overseeing rigged.
0297	CHUCK TODD	How do you tell Republican voters you are running a fair process when the frontrunner is calling what you're doing rigged?
0298	REINCE PRIEBUS	You know, look, I don't know what the motivation is.
0299	REINCE PRIEBUS	There's really nothing that's rigged or being changed or altered.
0300	REINCE PRIEBUS	These are the same rules that were in place basically for over a century.
0301	REINCE PRIEBUS	But at the very least, there's no way around the fact that all of these states submitted their delegate allocation plans by October 1st of 2015.
0302	REINCE PRIEBUS	And not a single thing has changed about it.
0303	REINCE PRIEBUS	These conventions that people talk about, number one, it's not common.
0304	REINCE PRIEBUS	But a few states out West use a convention system where delegates start competing at the county level a month ago, and they go through the county, the precinct, the congressional district in a state convention.
0305	REINCE PRIEBUS	And the candidates participate the whole way through.
0306	REINCE PRIEBUS	And no one was complaining, except for when it was all over.
0307	REINCE PRIEBUS	And look, every state is different.
0308	REINCE PRIEBUS	And you can reform the system.
0309	REINCE PRIEBUS	I mean, look, this has been an ongoing debate.
0310	REINCE PRIEBUS	But you have to go state by state by state.
0311	REINCE PRIEBUS	It's a pretty extraordinary task.
0312	CHUCK TODD	How concerned are you when Donald Trump says, "The R.N.C.
0313	CHUCK TODD	better be prepared for a rough July."
0314	CHUCK TODD	And are you concerned about reports of threats being made to delegates?
0315	CHUCK TODD	What do you say to any campaign doing that?
0316	REINCE PRIEBUS	Well, sure, I mean, look, there's no room for threatening the delegates or the convention or anybody that would be going to our national convention.
0317	REINCE PRIEBUS	But I also think some of this is rhetoric and hyperbole.
0318	REINCE PRIEBUS	And the truth is, is that the delegates themselves are the ones that write the rules for the convention.
0319	REINCE PRIEBUS	The R.N.C.
0320	REINCE PRIEBUS	doesn't write any rules.
0321	REINCE PRIEBUS	The R.N.C.
0322	REINCE PRIEBUS	has basically an administrative role at the convention.
0323	REINCE PRIEBUS	It's by majority rule, the delegates can run the convention.
0324	REINCE PRIEBUS	So it's on them to decide what they want to do about a lot of these issues, not us.
0325	CHUCK TODD	Who's picking this nominee?
0326	CHUCK TODD	The voters or the delegates?
0327	REINCE PRIEBUS	You know, I think it's a combination, but it's empowered by the voters.
0328	REINCE PRIEBUS	So the voters empower the delegates.
0329	REINCE PRIEBUS	But ultimately, the delegates who, in most cases are bound by the outcome of caucuses and primaries and conventions, make the decisions at the conventions.
0330	REINCE PRIEBUS	Think about this, I think we lose sight of what the word "convention" means.
0331	REINCE PRIEBUS	It's not a fourday party.
0332	REINCE PRIEBUS	A convention, in its legal sense, is the members of the party coming together every four years to write the rules of the party, to elect officers of our party, and a nominee.
0333	REINCE PRIEBUS	It has a legal value.
0334	REINCE PRIEBUS	It's no different than when, like, you know, the boy scouts have a national convention.
0335	REINCE PRIEBUS	They do similar things.
0336	REINCE PRIEBUS	And that's what's happening.
0337	REINCE PRIEBUS	But the media never covers the fact that we actually do a lot of business at the convention.
0338	REINCE PRIEBUS	But now everyone's interested in this business of a national convention.
0339	CHUCK TODD	Yes, they are.
0340	CHUCK TODD	That's for sure.
0341	CHUCK TODD	Look, we just have a brand new NBCWall Street Journal poll out.
0342	CHUCK TODD	Among Republican voters, we asked this simple question who should be the winner.
0343	CHUCK TODD	Should it be the candidate with the most primary votes, regardless of whether it's a majority, or the candidate who is the choice of the delegates.
0344	CHUCK TODD	By two to one, Chairman Priebus, Republican voters say it's got to be the one who has the most primary votes.
0345	CHUCK TODD	And that's going to be Donald Trump by a lot.
0346	CHUCK TODD	What do you tell those voters if it's not Trump?
0347	REINCE PRIEBUS	Well, look, if Donald Trump, if he was winning the majority of votes, he'd likely have the majority of delegates.
0348	REINCE PRIEBUS	But that's not actually what's happening.
0349	REINCE PRIEBUS	He's winning a plurality of votes, and he has a plurality of delegates.
0350	REINCE PRIEBUS	And under the rules and under the concept of this country, a majority rules on everything.
0351	REINCE PRIEBUS	Majority rules on the electoral college.
0352	REINCE PRIEBUS	Majority rules at the D.N.C., at the R.N.C.
0353	REINCE PRIEBUS	And I don't know too many places where majority doesn't rule.
0354	REINCE PRIEBUS	And I would suppose that if people were asked a question like that, it makes sense, but it only tells you half the story.
0355	CHUCK TODD	Very quick chariman very quick, I've got a couple of campaigns that are worried you're going to allow Trump to bully you.
0356	CHUCK TODD	What do you say to that?
0357	CHUCK TODD	Bully you and cave to his demands.
0358	REINCE PRIEBUS	No, listen, the rules are set.
0359	REINCE PRIEBUS	I've been pretty clear.
0360	REINCE PRIEBUS	I think I've done more TV in the last two weeks than I have in two years, and it's because I'm not going to allow anyone to rewrite the rules of our party.
0361	CHUCK TODD	All right.
0362	CHUCK TODD	Chairman Priebus, thanks for coming on Meet the Press this morning, good to see you.
0363	REINCE PRIEBUS	You bet.
0364	CHUCK TODD	When we come back, check out this sign.
0365	CHUCK TODD	Welcome to North Carolina.
0366	CHUCK TODD	Due to our stance on LGBT rights, please set your clock back 100 years.
0367	CHUCK TODD	Obviously a protest sign, and that of course refers to the bill that North Carolina's governor Pat McCrory signed into law, that many critics say discriminates against the LGBT community.
0368	CHUCK TODD	Governor McCrory joins me next exclusively.
0369	CHUCK TODD	North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has found himself on the frontlines of the latest battle for LGBT rights.
0370	CHUCK TODD	Heres what happened the states largest city, Charlotte, passed an ordinance that prevented businesses from discriminating against lesbians, gays and transgender people.
0371	CHUCK TODD	In response, Governor McCrory quickly signed into law a bill thats being called by some, antigay  the socalled bathroom law.
0372	CHUCK TODD	The law does a few things.
0373	CHUCK TODD	First, it invalidates the Charlotte ordinance and prevents other municipalities in the state from passing similar protections.
0374	CHUCK TODD	Second, it requires that transgender people use the bathroom and locker room matching their birthcertificate gender, rather than the gender they identify with.
0375	CHUCK TODD	Governor McCrory has been forced to defend and clarify the law's intent, which goes much further than just repealing the Charlotte ordinance.
0376	CHUCK TODD	All while he faces a tough reelection fight this November, and the governor of North Carolina joins me now.
0377	CHUCK TODD	Governor McCrory, welcome to Meet the Press.
0378	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Thanks for having me.
0379	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I appreciate it.
0380	CHUCK TODD	Uh, since you signed the executive order, and it was intended to try, I think you were trying to ratchet back some of the controversy here, you still had more companies joining the boycott here, Bloomberg, Capital One, United Airlines, William Sonoma.
0381	CHUCK TODD	That's just on Friday.
0382	CHUCK TODD	160 companies have called for its repeal.
0383	CHUCK TODD	You still have an NBA commissioner that is not yet committing to keeping the AllStar game in Charlotte.
0384	CHUCK TODD	Any estimates we have of lost revenue so far, we have come up with calculated, conservative calculations, $39.7 million, $186 million perhaps in revenue, and some have suggested billions in lost revenue.
0385	CHUCK TODD	All of this now, do you have regrets signing this law?
0386	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I'm going to, as governor, as I did with mayor, I will always call out government overreach.
0387	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And this example, the city of Charlotte, where I was mayor for 14 years, did government overreach.
0388	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And what your preclip didn't mention was it was the left that brought about the bathroom bill, not the right in the city of Charlotte, like the city of Houston tried to do and was rejected by 61 percent of the vote.
0389	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private sector employer in Charlotte, North Carolina, one of the largest, 15th, 16thlargest cities in the United States of America.
0390	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And I think that's government overreach.
0391	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	It's not government's business to tell the private sector what their bathroom, locker room, or shower  um  practices should be.
0392	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Not only the private business, but also the Y.M.C.A.
0393	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	and other nonprofit organizations.
0394	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And by the way, this is what 29 other states also do not have, these types of restroom, locker room, and bathroom policies.
0395	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	So
0396	CHUCK TODD	But I thought, you know, you talked about overreach.
0397	CHUCK TODD	Okay, you say Charlotte overreached.
0398	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Right.
0399	CHUCK TODD	How did the state of North Carolina, the state government, not overreach in just the same way.
0400	CHUCK TODD	You mentioned Houston.
0401	CHUCK TODD	Voters made that decision.
0402	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Right.
0403	CHUCK TODD	You can make a case, voters made the decision in Charlotte.
0404	CHUCK TODD	Charlotte rejected it, then elected two new members of the city council.
0405	CHUCK TODD	This has been a long debate in the city of Charlotte, this is where they came down.
0406	CHUCK TODD	You guys debated for, like, ten seconds.
0407	CHUCK TODD	I mean, don't you regret the time of debate?
0408	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Actually, Charlotte's vote was a very little debate.
0409	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	They just had a lot of public speakers speaking for and against
0410	CHUCK TODD	No, that night.
0411	CHUCK TODD	But this has been months  this has been months of a debate.
0412	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Look, when Charlotte had originally turned it down, just like Houston has.
0413	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And there hasn't been outrage, there wasn't outrage towards Charlotte when they turned it down initially.
0414	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	There was an outrage towards Houston, Texas, when they turned it down recently.
0415	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But I tell you what I have learned through this, is we've got to have more dialogue and not threats.
0416	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	You know, I was in Hamlet, North Carolina, a small town that can be at any town in the United States of America.
0417	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I walked into a buffet restaurant, African American buffet restaurant, and the people just welcomed me with open arms and said, "Thanks for protecting us."
0418	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I got back in my car, and I got a call from someone in corporate America going, "Man, you've got to change this.
0419	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	We're getting killed."
0420	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And it showed me the disconnect we have between the corporate suites and main street on a very complex subject, and a very personal subject regarding government policy of all things, which didn't exist before this group brought this up.
0421	CHUCK TODD	It's a very thoughtful thing for you to say about dialogue.
0422	CHUCK TODD	Where was the dialogue in this?
0423	CHUCK TODD	I mean, first of all, you didn't
0424	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Well, let me tell you.
0425	CHUCK TODD	Your legislature
0426	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I didn't want to
0427	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But legislature, to their defense
0428	CHUCK TODD	What dialogue?
0429	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	We had an April 1st deadline in which the Charlotte law was coming into effect.
0430	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And they had to pass the law prior to
0431	CHUCK TODD	But you had said you weren't worried about that deadline.
0432	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I wasn't.
0433	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	The legislature, according to their lawyers, were, because they were afraid once it became into effect, it would be harder to overturn.
0434	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And we can have the debate a longer time.
0435	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But again, I don't think government should be telling the private sector what their restroom and shower law should be, to allow a man into a woman's restroom, or a shower facility at a Y.M.C.A., for example.
0436	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	However, in government, and I'm not going to tell the private sector any manufacturing plan, any bank can have their own policies.
0437	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	NBC can have their own policy in Charlotte, North Carolina, or anywhere in North Carolina.
0438	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But I do believe in our high schools, in our middle schools, in our universities, we should continue to have the tradition that we've been having in this country for years.
0439	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And we have a women's facility and a men's facility.
0440	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	You know, it's worked out pretty well.
0441	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And I don't think we need any further government interference.
0442	CHUCK TODD	But this, as we talked about, this law went further than that.
0443	CHUCK TODD	It wiped away the city of Charlotte's ability to govern, to do some things on their own.
0444	CHUCK TODD	For instance, they can't even have their own minimum wage now.
0445	CHUCK TODD	Why'd you do that?
0446	CHUCK TODD	Why'd you sign that?
0447	CHUCK TODD	You're a former mayor of Charlotte.
0448	CHUCK TODD	Could you accept all these limitations that bigstate government has put on city and local control?
0449	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I made a point when I was mayor of Charlotte for 14 years, we dealt with fire and police and airports and roads and light rail lines, we didn't impose new regulations on businesses.
0450	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And I don't think the government ought to be the H.R.
0451	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	director for every business, whether it be in Charlotte or whether it be in Greensboro or whether it be in Boone, North Carolina.
0452	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And this is that fine line between how much does government tell the private sector in a regulatory way what to do, and in this case, a city which I still proudly call home, I think overstepped.
0453	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And, you know, I've called out my own Republican legislature in the past, with magistrates and I've said no the magistrates need to marry after the Supreme Court case, and what the Supreme Court said.
0454	CHUCK TODD	I understand that.
0455	CHUCK TODD	But you didn't, you know, in your executive order, you didn't, and you're not calling for a passage of protecting gay North Carolinians from discrimination if they're fired in the private sector.
0456	CHUCK TODD	Why?
0457	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Because I'm not the private sector's H.R.
0458	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	director.
0459	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I am the H.R.
0460	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	director and the governor of all state employees.
0461	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And I signed an executive order which protects all state employees, in the ninthlargest state in United States of America, the same executive order that the Louisiana governor just signed, and got praised for it.
0462	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I just happen to be a Republican governor, and I got criticized for doing the same thing.
0463	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I have to say, there are a little bit of politics involved here.
0464	CHUCK TODD	But with all due respect
0465	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Sure.
0466	CHUCK TODD	Barry Goldwater had said this when they were debating whether to have the Civil Rights act, and debating whether government should be involved in dealing with racial discrimination.
0467	CHUCK TODD	And he said, "I am unalterably opposed to discrimination of any sort.
0468	CHUCK TODD	But not law that embodies features like these provisions which fly in the face of the constitution, and which require for their effective execution, the creation of a police state."
0469	CHUCK TODD	The same argument was used to try to defeat laws that would  are now considered untouchable, right?
0470	CHUCK TODD	Laws that protect minorities from discrimination in the private sector.
0471	CHUCK TODD	Why don't gays and lesbians qualify?
0472	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I dont  first of all, I don't know of any business right now in North Carolina, and very similar to what Nikki Haley said about South Carolina, that is doing this.
0473	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But at the same time, what we've got to do is deal with this extremely new social norm that has come to our nation at a very quick period of time, and have these discussions about the complexity of equality while also balancing the concept of privacy, including even privacy in the most private of areas of our life, which is a restroom, locker room, or shower facility in our high schools.
0474	CHUCK TODD	But gender identity is the same privacy.
0475	CHUCK TODD	It's the same issue 
0476	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Well, now, the folks that are if thats the case 
0477	CHUCK TODD	It's dealing with that same privacy.
0478	CHUCK TODD	I mean, do you want somebody who identifies as a woman, born on their birth certificate as a man, may look like a woman, going into a men's bathroom?
0479	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	All I'd say is we have 27 states
0480	CHUCK TODD	Is that fair to them?
0481	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	We have 27 states, not just  this is not just a North Carolina debate.
0482	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	This is a national debate that's just come on in literally the last three months.
0483	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	No one had heard of this debate until the Houston ordinance was defeated by the people of Houston.
0484	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	We have 27 to 29 states that also don't have this type of mandate on private business, including the state of New York.
0485	CHUCK TODD	I'm curious about due diligence.
0486	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Sure.
0487	CHUCK TODD	Did you meet with any transgender people?
0488	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I have.
0489	CHUCK TODD	Before you signed that law?
0490	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Not with  but Ive met with transgender people in the past, and I've met with them since, and have had very positive conversations.
0491	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Now the conversation with a very powerful group called the Human Relations, uh, Human Rights Council, my gosh, they're more powerful than the N.R.A., and they have millions of dollars, which makes me want to overturn United, cause I don't know who their donors are either.
0492	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But they are putting on a lot of pressure, instead of having good dialogue.
0493	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And I had wonderful dialogue with a transgender woman who was, and we talked about each other's issues.
0494	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	There's passion on each side of this issue.
0495	CHUCK TODD	All right, but does it bother you at all though, Georgia defeated it, South Carolina
0496	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Wait a minute.
0497	CHUCK TODD	Does it bother you at all that basically North Carolina and Mississippi is the only other state to side with you on this.
0498	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Well, let me correct you.
0499	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Georgia and Mississippi was religious freedom bill.
0500	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	This was not a religious freedom bill.
0501	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	In fact, we have not had any religious freedom bill introduced in the state of North Carolina.
0502	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	One reason is because I'm governor.
0503	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	So the confusion by the national media and The New York Times of the Indiana religious freedom bill, Mississippi, and Georgia religious freedom bill, that's not the case.
0504	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	This is basically a restroom privacy issue, versus equality.
0505	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And these things need to be discussed, not threatened by Hollywood or anyone.
0506	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	You know, Hollywood, with all due respects to the Hollywood, the new Batman and Robin movie is playing in China, which has antigay, terrible, terrible human rights violations.
0507	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	This is not like an issue of bathroom privacy or restroom privacy in North Carolina.
0508	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And let's have this dialogue and I welcome that dialogue.
0509	CHUCK TODD	All right, Governor McCrory, is there any way this gets repealed?
0510	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I don't think the restroom, I do believe that
0511	CHUCK TODD	But you'll repeal other parts of this bill?
0512	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	There is one part of the bill that I do disagree with, where I signed it, and that is you're not able to sue within state courts.
0513	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And that needs to be repealed.
0514	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	It was very poorly thought out.
0515	CHUCK TODD	All right, we'll be watching for more.
0516	CHUCK TODD	Governor McCrory
0517	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Thanks for bringing me here, appreciate it.
0518	CHUCK TODD	Appreciate it.
0519	CHUCK TODD	When we come back, we'll have much more on the 2016 race.
0520	CHUCK TODD	And then there was this, last night on S.N.L.
0521	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0522	LARRY DAVID	Once I'm elected president, I'll have a nice schvitz in the White House gym, then I'll go to the big banks, I'll sit them down and yada yada yada, they'll be broken up.
0523	JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS	What?
0524	JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS	No, no, you can't "yada yada" at
0525	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0526	CHUCK TODD	When we come back the Republican party has 31 governorships, the most senators since 2005 and the most members of the House since the Hoover presidency.
0527	CHUCK TODD	So why does it seem the party has the death wish when it comes to trying to win the White House?
0528	CHUCK TODD	Panel is back, were going to discuss the Republican presidential race, weve got a lot going on in this show.
0529	CHUCK TODD	Hugh Hewitt, Reince Priebus is trying very hard to claim that the process is not rigged.
0530	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump is trying very hard to paint it as rigged.
0531	CHUCK TODD	Who has got the better PR case?
0532	HUGH HEWITT	RNC has the better facts as Reince Priebus pointed out in your interview.
0533	HUGH HEWITT	They have instructed the committee this week not to make any rule changes.
0534	HUGH HEWITT	Any rule changes will be done by the delegates themselves.
0535	HUGH HEWITT	Look, Donald Trump does very well building skyscrapers ,not building state delegation majorities.
0536	HUGH HEWITT	He got beat in Georgia last night, cue Vicki Lawrence the night the lights went out in Georgia, I think the Cruz campaign has won twelve consecutive victories over five states, including delegations.
0537	CHUCK TODD	Ill put up a little graphic right now actually we put together.
0538	CHUCK TODD	He has beaten on delegates 2 to 1 since March 22nd.
0539	CHUCK TODD	Hes netted 66 but guess what, that advantage is erased on Tuesday with New York.
0540	HUGH HEWITT	Trump is coming back because Ivanka has returned to the trail.
0541	HUGH HEWITT	I think she is a tremendous, there is a piece in the New York Times this morning by Jonathan Moller, on how she is poised and disciplined and bringing that to her fathers campaign.
0542	HUGH HEWITT	So the solution here is a fusion ticket Cruz Trump but Ivanka is the Vice President.
0543	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Thats insanity.
0544	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Let me tell you, Trump has got the same trump card that Bernie has democracy.
0545	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Ever since at least since the KennedyHumphrey fight over the nomination in Wisconsin and West Virginia.
0546	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Certainly through Reagan against Bush, certainly Obama against Hillary.
0547	CHRIS MATTHEWS	We watched the primaries to see who the nominee is and now were told dont watch the primaries anymore, theres this thing at the convention with the rules and you have to have a majority vote.
0548	CHRIS MATTHEWS	The numbers do show overwhelmingly, the Republican people believe in democracy and Trump makes that case.
0549	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Bernie makes it against the billionaires and Citizens United and its the same argument, the people should vote.
0550	CHUCK TODD	You know the problem Perry, is the political parties modeled their nominating process after the electoral college which, by the way, isnt one person one vote either.
0551	CHUCK TODD	PERRY BACON JR.
0552	CHUCK TODD	But I think Trump has had a really good week in making this argument.
0553	CHUCK TODD	If you look at, we have these primaries for a reason and theyre not for fun.
0554	CHUCK TODD	The idea is that they matter to some extent.
0555	CHUCK TODD	I disagree with Chris a little bit in that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are winning the most delegates and the most states.
0556	CHUCK TODD	And I think that for most people thats who the winner is and I think Reince has got to make a better argument than the rules are the rules are the rules.
0557	CHRIS MATTHEWS	How do you disagree with me?
0558	CHRIS MATTHEWS	PERRY BACON JR.
0559	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Because Chris, because Hillary Clinton not Bernie Sanders is the one winning the primary so I dont think democracy is for
0560	CHRIS MATTHEWS	No I said the rhetorical argument is for one man one vote.
0561	CHUCK TODD	They have the same rhetorical argument, yes.
0562	KATHLEEN PARKER	For the record I agree with Chris on that because it is a good argument.
0563	KATHLEEN PARKER	Look we care about people's votes right, oh no not really.
0564	KATHLEEN PARKER	But I think Trump is actually going to have a very good week and, actually a couple of really good weeks, because hes obviously going to take New York.
0565	KATHLEEN PARKER	Hes predicted to get 85 to 90 of the 95 delegates and the leftovers are out in Staten Island and who knows.
0566	KATHLEEN PARKER	But, you know, after that he goes out to Pennsylvania and Maryland and on and on and Indiana going in so hes going to build some fresh momentum and I think thats going to make a difference.
0567	CHUCK TODD	By the way guys weve got more of our NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll, a little taste of it.
0568	CHUCK TODD	Maybe it doesnt surprise people, but the two most popular presidential candidates by the American public overall are John Kasich and Bernie Sanders.,
0569	KATHLEEN PARKER	Right.
0570	KATHLEEN PARKER	Because theyre good people
0571	CHUCK TODD	The lowest negative rating among all Republican candidates is Kasich. Look at that.
0572	CHUCK TODD	Trumps at 65 percent negative rating among all voters, Ted Cruz at 49 percent.
0573	CHUCK TODD	Hugh Hewitt, those are tough numbers man.
0574	CHUCK TODD	And by the way let me put up Hillary Clinton, 56 percent negative rating.
0575	CHUCK TODD	Again, SandersKasich is what the people want apparently.
0576	HUGH HEWITT	Parties are continuing bodies, they are not the public.
0577	HUGH HEWITT	They stand for an ideological set of principles.
0578	HUGH HEWITT	I was at the Republican Jewish committee in Nevada where Ted Cruz got four standing ovations from a decidedly not ideologically strong conservative.
0579	HUGH HEWITT	I believe hes going to be the nominee because he is more consistently with the ideological spectrum that is the continuing Republican party.
0580	HUGH HEWITT	Donald Trumps had a good week, Kathleens right he's going to have a good couple of weeks.
0581	HUGH HEWITT	He aint getting close to 1237.
0582	CHUCK TODD	Wow.
0583	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Hes going to win.
0584	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Trump will be the nominee, probably for the opposite reason you say.
0585	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Why is every conservative radio guy basically for Cruz?
0586	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Explain the culture to me.
0587	HUGH HEWITT	Actually, theyre not.
0588	HUGH HEWITT	Theyre all over the place
0589	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Its overwhelming
0590	HUGH HEWITT	The only guy whos come out actually, formally, is Mark Levin.
0591	HUGH HEWITT	Who has an enormous And Im very neutral, Im completely
0592	CHRIS MATTHEWS	You are?
0593	HUGH HEWITT	Im Switzerland.
0594	HUGH HEWITT	I dont endorse anyone
0595	CHUCK TODD	No and hes been You said if Trumps the nominee you said youd support him.
0596	HUGH HEWITT	I said Id support him.
0597	CHRIS MATTHEWS	All I hear is radio talk for Cruz.
0598	HUGH HEWITT	Youve gotta listen.
0599	HUGH HEWITT	Only on Mark Levin is he strong that way.
0600	HUGH HEWITT	But I will say, those in the local markets who are longterm ideological conservatives, like Charlie Sykes in Wisconsin, like Ted Cruz because of his policies.
0601	PERRY BACON JR.	I want to add, I thought after Wisconsin maybe Ted Cruz was starting to get more popular among moderate Republicans.
0602	PERRY BACON JR.	And the polls are showing Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, Ted Cruz is not broadening his coalition and thats a problem.
0603	PERRY BACON JR.	Hes not really doing as well as he should.
0604	CHUCK TODD	Kathleen, very quickly, I think New York Values kneecapped him
0605	KATHLEEN PARKER	Totally.
0606	CHUCK TODD	And he couldnt figure out a way out of it.
0607	KATHLEEN PARKER	No, you cant get out of it.
0608	KATHLEEN PARKER	I mean, I think hes eating alone in a fried chicken joint in the Bronx
0609	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0610	CHUCK TODD	I think now the Cruz campaign wishes they said, hey, New York is yours Trump, we are going to camp out in Indiana and Pennsylvania.
0611	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Remember the guy who did that before, Gary Hart hes eating L.A. with a gay group, and hes sort of making fun of New Jersey aesthetically.
0612	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Im sure glad Im here and not New Jersey in some solid waste dump.
0613	CHUCK TODD	And guess what happened?
0614	CHUCK TODD	New Jersey's delegates went to Walter Mondale, and he was the nominee.
0615	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Right.
0616	CHUCK TODD	Quick programming note, we're going to take a quick break here.
0617	CHUCK TODD	A quick programming note, my colleague Lester Holt's going to be anchoring Nightly News live from the Middle East tomorrow, and with it, he'll have an exclusive interview with the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter.
0618	CHUCK TODD	Remember, there are serious issues that we are facing besides the way we argue about this election.
0619	CHUCK TODD	And when we come back in 45 seconds, we'll have Endgame and the debate over the socalled "bathroom law in North Carolina.
0620	CHUCK TODD	Endgame time.
0621	CHUCK TODD	Panel is here.
0622	CHUCK TODD	Obviously I had Governor McCrory on earlier.
0623	CHUCK TODD	Kathleen Parker, you and he sparred via column.
0624	CHUCK TODD	You had a column that hit him pretty hard.
0625	CHUCK TODD	He did a letter to the editor hitting back at your column.
0626	KATHLEEN PARKER	And we may not make up.
0627	CHUCK TODD	Good to hear.
0628	CHUCK TODD	What did you make of the governors response?
0629	KATHLEEN PARKER	Well, besides the fact that Governor's from Ohio, he's certainly mastered the southern arts of sweet talk and finesse.
0630	KATHLEEN PARKER	You know, the fact of the matter, as you pointed out, there is still in place this prohibition that local municipalities can have their own anti  sorry  discrimination laws.
0631	KATHLEEN PARKER	Now he's backing off of that now, and I think calling it more or less it was hasty, poor writing, crafting of the bill.
0632	KATHLEEN PARKER	And so that's good.
0633	KATHLEEN PARKER	I give him credit for that.
0634	KATHLEEN PARKER	But still, you're allowing, the state is allowing private businesses, for example, to say, "I'm sorry, but we don't serve gays here."
0635	KATHLEEN PARKER	Or, "We don't let gay people spend the night in our hotels."
0636	KATHLEEN PARKER	You know, there's no recourse for those people, because unless these municipalities can pass their own antidiscrimination laws, then, you know, they're out of luck.
0637	KATHLEEN PARKER	But on the bathroom bill, this to me seems to be such a bogus issue all together.
0638	KATHLEEN PARKER	I don't know what they're afraid of, you know?
0639	KATHLEEN PARKER	It's not as though you're going to have on the one hand, I'll hear from readers in North Carolina say, "So in other words, you, Kathleen Parker, think that perverts, men, ought to be able to come into bathrooms and assault tenyearold girls," right?
0640	KATHLEEN PARKER	So they're being fed some kind of crazy false narrative about what this is.
0641	CHRIS MATTHEWS	The crazy thing is, this is nanny state at its worst, if you think about it.
0642	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Where do they want the transsexuals to go?
0643	CHRIS MATTHEWS	If someone identifies, dresses, looks like a woman, that person shows up in a men's room at National Reagan Airport.
0644	CHRIS MATTHEWS	What happens then?
0645	CHRIS MATTHEWS	I mean, if you follow the law the governor signed, what goes on then?
0646	CHRIS MATTHEWS	You know, confusion and everything and probably a lot of disruption.
0647	CHUCK TODD	Hugh, you know, one thing that I'm going to point out here is that, I don't know if this is true or not, but this yet another Republican governor that I feel as if his legislature did something that maybe he didn't want to do, and he felt as if he had no choice but to sign the legislation.
0648	CHUCK TODD	Do you think that's at work here?
0649	HUGH HEWITT	It's possible.
0650	HUGH HEWITT	I mean, he did very well in his interview.
0651	HUGH HEWITT	He leaned into the problem, quoting Chris Matthew, "Hang a lantern on your problem," showing up at Meet the Press on the Sunday after the controversy is very smart.
0652	HUGH HEWITT	He'll probably be reelected.
0653	HUGH HEWITT	But this is not the terrain the Republican party wants to fight this election on.
0654	HUGH HEWITT	Going back to your Clooney interview, and by the way, I thought he was a better Batman than Ben Affleck at least, so
0655	CHUCK TODD	The bathroom debate and batman debate here today, okay.
0656	HUGH HEWITT	I want to argue about campaign financing.
0657	KATHLEEN PARKER	Absolutely, Michael Keaton.
0658	HUGH HEWITT	I want to point out that Charles Koch lives in Wichita, Kansas, in the same house that he has since 1974.
0659	HUGH HEWITT	I want to argue that Tom Steiner is trying to buy.
0660	HUGH HEWITT	I don't want to argue about bathroom bills.
0661	HUGH HEWITT	I want to argue about ISIS and Libya going downhill.
0662	HUGH HEWITT	This is not our terrain.
0663	HUGH HEWITT	We should not fight.
0664	CHUCK TODD	You know I heard somebody say to me, Perry Bacon?
0665	CHUCK TODD	This is what happens because Republicans overdid it on redistricting.
0666	CHUCK TODD	And so yes, these folks are listening to their constituents, but only their constituents.
0667	CHUCK TODD	Almost a narrow band of them.
0668	KATHLEEN PARKER	Thats right.
0669	PERRY BACON	I'm not sure in this case thats even true.
0670	PERRY BACON	As you pointed out though Georgia, South Carolina, Nikki Haley said, "We're not doing that law here."
0671	PERRY BACON	She was very explicit about that.
0672	PERRY BACON	I just think the Governor of North Carolina, the legislature missed the boat here.
0673	PERRY BACON	He used the phrase "changing social norms."
0674	PERRY BACON	He's right.
0675	PERRY BACON	People who are transgender are more accepted today.
0676	PERRY BACON	Last year was a big year for gay rights.
0677	PERRY BACON	I just think he might have, you know, you asked him, "Have you talked to anyone who was transgender before this bill passed?"
0678	PERRY BACON	And he all but said, "No."
0679	PERRY BACON	I just think he made a political mistake here without sort of thinking through the contours of the issue.
0680	PERRY BACON	Any time you have to send an executive order to a bill you signed three weeks before, you probably didn't think about it through the first time very carefully.
0681	CHUCK TODD	Alright.
0682	CHUCK TODD	Let's lighten things up a little bit, besides our Batman debate.
0683	CHUCK TODD	Before we go, last night's S.N.L.
0684	CHUCK TODD	was a real treat for Seinfeld fans, which by the way now we're getting two decades old.
0685	CHUCK TODD	With Larry David as Bernie Sanders encountering Julia Louis Dreyfus's Elaine.
0686	CHUCK TODD	Take a look.
0687	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0688	LARRY DAVID	Once I'm elected president, I'll have a nice schvitz in the White House gym, then I'll go to the big banks, I'll sit them down and yada yada yada, they'll be broken up.
0689	JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS	What?
0690	JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS	No, no, you can't "yada yada" at a debate.
0691	JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS	Also, you "yada yada'd" over the best part.
0692	LARRY DAVID	No, I mentioned the schvitz.
0693	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0694	CHUCK TODD	That's all we have today.
0695	CHUCK TODD	I'm going to go have some lobster bisque.
0696	CHUCK TODD	We'll be back next week.
0697	CHUCK TODD	Because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.
