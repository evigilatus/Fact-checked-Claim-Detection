After publication, we received more complete video of the question-and-answer session between McCaskill and a constituent that showed she was in fact responding to a question about private planes, as well as a report describing the meeting. We re-assessed the evidence, archived the original version here, and published the version you see here with a new rating of Half True. We apologize for the error.\nPrivate planes have been a long-running headache for Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.\nIn 2011, she sold a family owned private plane and repaid the federal government $88,000 for flights she paid for through her Senate office. Earlier this year, while running for a third term in a nip-and-tuck race, McCaskill took heat for using her current private plane to criss-cross portions of the state while she was supposedly on a three-day RV tour of the state.\nThe Senate Leadership Fund \u2014 a pro-Republican super PAC with close ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 is seeking to remind voters about this history in an ad released Oct. 16.\nThe ad takes aim at McCaskill\u2019s \"high-flying lifestyle.\" An animated plane labeled \"Air Claire\" leads the viewer through the ad, and the narrator cites investments by her husband in the Cayman Islands and reminds viewers of the money McCaskill repaid to the treasury for flights.\nAt one point, the narrator says, \"Claire even said this about private planes.\" The ad then shows footage of McCaskill saying, \"That normal people can afford it.\" The narrator returns to ask, \"Normal people can afford a private plane?\" The ad concludes with the narrator saying, \"Multimillionaire Claire McCaskill: Way out of touch with Missouri.\"\nDid McCaskill really say that \"normal people can afford\" private planes?\nShe did, but the ad takes her literal words out of context.\nThe remark occurred at an Aug. 19, 2017, town hall in Kennett, Mo., located in the state\u2019s southeastern \"bootheel.\" McCaskill was taking a question from Sam Jewell, the manager of Kennett Memorial Airport, who asked whether the federal air traffic system should be privatized.\nMcCaskill responded that her answer was not at the moment, but she added that she hoped the privatization push would nudge the Federal Aviation Administration into long-needed upgrades of its radar system. (We\u2019ve summarized her answer in this article, but you can read the full transcript here.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nJewell responded, \"Well, when you go to any other country, you know the cost of flying \u2014 I just had a friend who went home to Greece and was trying to fly around over there, it costs like $500 just to go from one little city to the next, and you have to have credit cards on file for them to charge your account. You know, that\u2019s one thing the United States has that nobody else has, is the freedom to fly around and be affordable where a normal person can afford it.\"\nMcCaskill then responded, \"Will you remind them when they come after me about my husband\u2019s plane? That normal people can afford it?\" The crowd laughed. \"Yeah, but I understand the fear, and I understand the uncertainty, but I remain committed to trying to look at any solution we can find to get our stuff updated, but not at the expense of general aviation.\"\nBy showing her words in isolation, the Senate Leadership Fund exaggerates McCaskill\u2019s remark.\nMcCaskill was wrapping up a wonky discussion of federal aviation privatization with a constituent whose business depended heavily on the resolution of that issue.\nShe was directly responding to Jewell\u2019s remarks about a friend\u2019s comparative experiences flying a private plane in the United States and Greece. She repeated Jewell\u2019s words when she used the phrase \"normal people.\" In context, these seem to refer to \"normal\" users of private planes, not to \"normal\" Americans more generally.\nIn addition to snipping out Jewell\u2019s lead-in comment, the ad also cut what followed McCaskill\u2019s retort: laughter from the crowd. The McCaskill campaign said she was attempting to make a joke that elaborated on what the audience member said, and it appears at least some people listening took it that way.\nOur ruling\nThe Senate Leadership Fund says McCaskill \"even said this about private planes, \u2018that normal people can afford it.\u2019\"\nShe said those words, but the footage in the ad leaves out both the lead-in comment that prompted McCaskill\u2019s remark and the laughter that followed it. The full footage makes it clear that McCaskill was wrapping up a policy-heavy debate with a private-aviation manager and with a riff using the airport manager\u2019s words. In context, he was referring to \"normal\" users of private planes, as opposed to \"normal\" Americans more generally.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-10-17 17:58:37 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says Claire McCaskill \"even said this about private planes, \u2018that normal people can afford it.\u2019\"    Senate Leadership Fund GOP super PAC https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcDYse2R-W0&feature=youtu.be   a campaign ad Tuesday, October 16, 2018 2018-10-16    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01465"}
