So if you, seven years, 10 years into the job \u2026 it was almost impossible to get rid of a teacher. Now, with the evaluation processes that we're going to have going forward, teachers aren't performing as they should be and they get bad evaluations we can move to remove those teachers much more quickly,\" Sweeney (D-Gloucester) said.\n\n\"So does that change tenure or does that end tenure?\" Lehrer asked. \"Should we say tenure is over in New Jersey?\"\n\n\"No, tenure still exists but it's been overhauled,\" Sweeney said. \"I would say Brian it's been modernized.\"\n\nSaying that tenure provides teachers a \"lifetime job\" suggests there is no process for firing teachers. However, such a system existed prior to this legislation, though critics argue it was so costly and cumbersome that it was hardly used.\n\nBut for this fact-check, we\u2019re only examining Sweeney\u2019s claim that tenure for teachers still exists in New Jersey.\n\nLast year, PolitiFact New Jersey gave Gov. Chris Christie a Half True for saying that when the New Jersey Education Association, the state\u2019s largest teachers union, says he wants to \"eliminate tenure, that\u2019s not true.\"\n\nBut Christie\u2019s proposals and the new legislation differ in several ways.\n\nThe legislation creates an annual evaluation system for educators, a plan backed by Christie. Under the system teachers can receive one of four ratings: ineffective, partially effective, effective and highly effective.\n\nNew teachers must complete a one-year mentorship program and then receive positive evaluations in two of the next three years in order to receive tenure. Previously, teachers earned tenure after three years on the job.\n\nThe legislation also requires the filing of an inefficiency charge against tenured teachers receiving negative evaluations for two consecutive years. But teachers can contest those charges with an arbitrator. Previously, administrative law judges handled such disputes.\n\nUnder Christie\u2019s plan and the legislation as it was first introduced teachers who received negative evaluations would lose their tenure rights and therefore could not contest their dismissal, except in narrow circumstances outlined in the original bill.\n\nNJEA spokesman Steve Baker said tenure still exists under the new legislation.\n\n\"The fundamental issue is that a teacher, having earned tenure, retains the right to due process before she or he can be fired,\" Baker said. \"Tenure, under statute, is simply the right to due process in the form of a chance to have a hearing before a neutral third party.\"\n\nJeffrey Keefe, a professor at Rutgers University\u2019s School of Management and Labor Relations, said there are two elements of teacher tenure: a just-cause requirement for dismissal after three years of probation and seniority in layoffs provided the teacher is certified for a potential vacancy possibly held by a less senior teacher.\n\nChristie wanted to eliminate seniority protections during layoffs. But the \"last in, first out\" system -- which means the newest teachers are laid off first -- remains intact in the new legislation.\n\n\"I think tenure was overhauled in the bill, since schools could always dismiss a teacher for cause including poor performance (provided there were efforts to correct the unacceptable performance),\" Keefe said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSweeney said \"tenure still exists but it's been overhauled\" in New Jersey.\n\nA bill approved by the Legislature makes it more difficult to earn tenure and requires inefficiency charges to be filed against teachers receiving negative evaluations for two consecutive years. But the bill does not eliminate a tenured teacher\u2019s right to appeal those charges.\n\nThe law also maintains seniority protections during layoffs.\n\nFor those reasons, we rate Sweeney\u2019s statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10801"}
