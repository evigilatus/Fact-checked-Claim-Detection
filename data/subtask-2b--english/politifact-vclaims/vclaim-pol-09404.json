After all, Austin kaboomed in size and population in the intervening decades.\n\nBy phone, Moorhead said her April 23, 2013, tweet echoed a remark by Ryan Robinson, the city\u2019s demographer, during discussion at the summit of voter-adopted plans to elect Austin City Council members from separate districts rather than citywide. Moorhead told us Robinson might even have said that Butler by himself drew more votes in 1973 than Leffingwell got in 2012.\n\nRobinson confirmed his reference to total voter turnout in 1973 and 2012, but told us by phone he did not compare how many votes the mayors drew in the elections nearly four decades apart.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that citizen interest in local elections has been on a downslide. According to a Sept. 13, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, in the spring of 1971, 57 percent of the city's 93,597 registered voters came to the polls for that year\u2019s mayoral election. In 1981, 38 percent of registered voters turned out for the city\u2019s mayoral election, the story said, with turnout dipping to 23 percent in the 1991 mayoral election, 15 percent in 2003 and 10 percent in the 2012 election that gave Leffingwell a second term.\n\nGiven that Moorhead\u2019s claim referred to the voters turning out in 1973 and 2012, we checked city records for precise details. According to one city web page, 63,478 of 151,368 registered voters, 42 percent, turned out for the April 7, 1973 election in which Butler won reelection as mayor. On May 12, 2012, according to another city web page, 49,336 of 461,146 registered voters, 11 percent, participated in the election including Leffingwell\u2019s reelection bid. (Also, Butler drew 43,753 votes, Leffingwell 25,446.)\n\nThe city web pages indicate the city\u2019s population nearly tripled in the years in between, rising from 290,300 in 1973 to 824,205 in 2012.\n\nUpshot: There were 14,142 fewer voters in the 2012 city election compared to 1973.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMoorhead tweeted that more Austinites voted in the city\u2019s 1973 election featuring a mayor\u2019s race than in the city\u2019s most recent mayoral election.\n\nNearly 63,500 voters cast ballots in April 1973. Less than 49,400 participated in May 2012. We rate this claim as True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09404"}
