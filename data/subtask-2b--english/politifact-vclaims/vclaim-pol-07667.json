Hartzler says Export-Import Bank is free for taxpayers", "text": "One of the tea party\u2019s newest pet peeves is the Export-Import Bank -- a little-known government agency that the party is hoping to abolish.\nWhat\u2019s the Export-Import Bank? It\u2019s a government agency that gives low-interest loans and guarantees to foreign buyers in hopes of promoting American exports. The tea party calls it crony capitalism.\nWe decided to tackle a striking claim that the bank\u2019s supporters, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, frequently tout -- but one critics say is misleading.\nWe heard it most recently from Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., in a June 24 Roll Call interview.\nShe said the Export-Import Bank \"doesn't cost taxpayers anything.\"\nA government agency? That doesn't cost taxpayers anything? How can that be?\nIn contrast, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who has been leading the current effort against the bank, told the House Committee on Financial Services on June 26, 2014, \"We should examine where the money comes from to finance Ex-Im. Whose money is it? Obviously, it\u2019s taxpayers\u2019 money.\"\nWhat is the Export-Import Bank?\nThe Export-Import Bank is a federal agency founded in 1934 that finances foreign buyers with loans, guarantees and other products -- at lower interest rates than they would get from a private bank -- to help them purchase American products. About 60 other countries have similar agencies.\nOverall, the bank finances less than 5 percent exports annually. In 2013, the bank supported about $37.4 billion in exports. Its biggest, and thus most controversial, beneficiary is Boeing.\nThose who support it say the bank makes American companies more competitive globally by incentivizing foreign buyers. Those who are against it say it is corporate welfare that helps hand-picked companies while disadvantaging businesses that don\u2019t use the bank.\nIt's a hot topic because the agency's charter is up for congressional reauthorization in September. Its current three-year term ends in 2015.\nHow much does it cost?\nEvery year Congress sets a limit on the bank\u2019s financial activities. The bank then borrows money from the Treasury to give out direct loans, which it pays back with interest.\nSince 2008, the bank has not relied on taxpayer dollars to cover its operational costs and loan loss reserves. Instead, the bank charges customers fees and interest that it uses to cover those costs in full. Often, the fees generate a surplus, which the bank gives back to the Treasury. In the past five years, the bank has given back $2 billion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the bank\u2019s default rates have historically been lower than private financial institutions -- the current default rate is less than 0.25 percent.\nThe bank hasn\u2019t been completely without losses, though. In 1987, several straight years of losses of more than $250 million to $300 million forced the bank to ask Congress for a $3 billion bailout. \u00a0\nThe most recent losses were in the 1990s, following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, said Export-Import Bank Advisory Board member Gary Hufbauer, also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank. \u00a0\nStill, the bank has generated an overall profit of more than $5 billion for the Treasury since 1990. But just looking at cash flow doesn\u2019t give us a full picture.\nLong-term costs\nThe bank\u2019s overall revenue isn\u2019t as high as it could be because the interest rates are lower than market rate, said Charles Calomiris, a finance professor at Columbia University. This means\u00a0there is a cost to taxpayers in terms of lost opportunity, and it will eventually become a loss in cash flow. Some economists believe that the incoming revenue will not be able to keep up with defaults adding up over the long term.\nIt may take 100 years to see the costs in terms of cash flow, but they are always there, Calomiris said.\n\"Loan subsidies don't come from thin air. They are paid for by the taxpayers. So, saying that the Export-Import bank is free is wrong,\" he said.\nHe noted that federal mortgage loan providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rarely reported cash flow losses until 2008, when their monumental losses contributed to the Great Recession.\nAdding to the debate is a Congressional Budget Office report from May that gives a 10-year projection for the Export-Import Bank using two different accounting methods -- yielding two disparate outcomes.\nOne shows the program operating at a $14 billion surplus, the other shows it with a $2 billion loss. The positive results from the method the government has traditionally used to assess the program. The loss results from a fair-value method of examining the program the way a private financial institution would, taking more risk into account.\nThe bank's proponents say it\u2019s wrong to treat government lenders like private lenders because the conditions are so different. The bank\u2019s accepted accounting method better reflects factors like the Export-Import Bank's high credibility, lower tax burden and lower interest rates.\n\"Comparable private market interest rates and guarantee fees seldom exist as benchmarks for Ex-Im Bank financing,\" Hufbauer said in a Peterson Institute blog.\nOur ruling\nHartzler said the Export-Import Bank \"doesn\u2019t cost taxpayers anything.\"\nIt\u2019s true that in recent years, the bank has actually made a net profit on its loans and turned in money to the U.S. Treasury. But in the past, the bank has had years of losses and actually cost taxpayers money. Some economists think that could easily happen again, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like an immediate danger.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07667"}
