YouTube witness makes shocking admission on live TV! CNN pulls plug immediately!\"\nThe \"admission\" in the post was an employee at YouTube telling a Fox News affiliate reporter, \"I didn\u2019t have a gun on me, but I wish I did.\" Here\u2019s a screenshot of the video.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note the time in the upper left corner: 2:03 p.m. Pacific time.\nNow, here\u2019s the screenshot of CNN in the Daily Vine piece.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time stamp is 1:46 p.m. Pacific time, or about 15 minutes before the clip that CNN purportedly masked with a faux breakdown in its video feed.\nSo the clips don\u2019t match up.\nIn addition, the clip of the eyewitness appeared on Fox News, not CNN.\nJust to be complete, we used the real-time television recording service TVEyes to watch CNN\u2019s coverage for the full minute of 1:46 p.m. PT. The network was interviewing an expert named Josh Campbell, and there was no technical interruption, and no break in the video feed.\nWhat we have seems to be nothing more than some basic use of photo editing and a completely false headline.\nThis is a fine example of Pants on Fire fake news.\n Share the Facts 2018-04-06 17:09:34 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire   \"YouTube witness makes shocking admission on live TV.
