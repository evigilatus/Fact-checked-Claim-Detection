RELENTLESS!\" (The photos don\u2019t show what Trump was signing.)\nOn Sunday, top Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump was doing well and that the president and his campaign have taken COVID-19 seriously. But, Miller also noted, the president needed to continue advocating for and working on behalf of the American people.\nContrast that with Biden, Miller told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \"We\u2019ve seen with Joe Biden, I mean, we can\u2019t all stay in our basement for the rest of our lives,\" Miller said.\nIt\u2019s one of Trump\u2019s favorite attacks against Biden. It\u2019s also, by any objective measure, wrong.\nWhat Trump says about Biden\u2019s basement, a sampling\nBefore his coronavirus diagnosis, Trump made the basement attack a routine part of his campaign speech.\n\"I got a guy who stays in his damn basement all day long and I'm doing this,\"\u00a0 Trump said at a Virginia rally Sept. 25.\n\"Where's Hunter? You know where he is? Yeah. He's in the basement with his father,\" Trump said, talking about Biden\u2019s son Hunter on Sept. 21 in Ohio.\n\"I've been in so many states the last few days. Yeah. Well you need a lot of energy to do this job properly. You can't be sitting in your basement for four days and come out,\" Trump said Sept. 14 in Arizona.\n\"He's in his basement right now, and he's saying, \u2018What do I do?\u2019 He calls his handlers, \u2018What do I do about this?\u2019 He hasn't left in two and a half days,\" said Trump Sept. 13 in Las Vegas.\n\"He's in his damn basement again. No, he's in his basement. He's in his basement,\" Trump said Sept. 12 in Nevada.\nThese don\u2019t look like basements\nIn the first months of the pandemic, when many states employed significant restrictions, Biden ran much of his campaign from his Delaware home. He built a TV set in his basement to interact with voters virtually. Not all those interactions went smoothly.\u00a0\nTrump also suspended in-person campaigning from March 2 through June 20, when he held an indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla.\nBut the claim that Biden stays in his basement is easily refuted.\nLet\u2019s look at Biden\u2019s events in September as an example. (All links go to the C-SPAN video so you can watch the event for yourself.)\nSept. 2: Biden delivered remarks in Wilmington, Del., on reopening schools.\nSept. 3: Biden and his wife visited Kenosha, Wis., where Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man, was shot by police. Biden spoke from a church about the history of systemic racism in the United States.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The event was part of his \"Build Back Better Express Tour.\"\nThat\u2019s at least 14 public events not in Biden\u2019s basement in September. He made trips to seven states: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. Biden did address the Poor People\u2019s Campaign virtually from his basement on Sept. 14.\nThe Trump campaign cited as evidence comments Biden made that he would be willing shut down the economy if scientists advised him it was necessary to protect Americans from the coronavirus. Biden later clarified that in his view there would be no need to close the entire U.S. economy.\nOur ruling\nMiller said, \"We\u2019ve seen with Joe Biden, I mean, we can\u2019t all stay in our basement for the rest of our lives.\"\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the same criticism used by Trump to attack his rival as incapable and sleepy. It\u2019s also wrong. We counted at least 14 different events outside Biden\u2019s Delaware home in September, in six different states.\nWe rate this claim False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18608"}
