The story is fake.\nThe story says two \"private intelligence agencies\" have determined that several news leaks that have been damaging to the Trump administration \u2014 from plans for executive orders to internal fights with staff \u2014 likely came from the president\u2019s own phone.\nBut TheSeattleTribune.com is a website that makes up their stories, and is associated with another faux news site called AssociatedMediaCoverage.com. Their disclaimer says the website \"is a news and entertainment satire web publication\" and that all articles \"are fictional and presumably satirical news.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the counter on the story is to be believed, this one has been viewed more than 171,000 times in less than a week.
