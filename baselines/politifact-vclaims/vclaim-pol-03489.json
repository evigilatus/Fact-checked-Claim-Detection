Facebook flagged a link to the story on Obnoxioustv's Blog\u00a0as a potential fake news story. The post, first published in 2013, has appeared again recently on social media sites. We could not find any coverage of the story on reputable news sites, and the website\u2019s owner did not reply to our inquiry.\nIs the post correct that a man has infected as many as 300 people with HIV?\nThe New York City Health Department\nThe post quotes the New York City Health Department urging anyone who may be affected to seek help.\nWe reached out to the department about the story. The department said both the quote and the story are fake.\n\"We can confirm that this story is completely false,\" the department said in an email.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime Stoppers\nThe article provided a Crime Stoppers phone number for anyone with information to call. So we called.\nThe number was, indeed, for Crime Stoppers -- but in South Carolina.\nThe operator searched for the name of the alleged offender and his crime for us. A query led to the same article we set out to fact-check, along with a few others.\nThe New York City Police Department runs New York City Crime Stoppers. The Police Department did not respond to our inquiry about the story, so we called the New York City Crime Stoppers line. The operator advised us not to share the article on social media.\n\"We haven\u2019t heard anything about that,\" the operator said.\nThe New York City Crime Stoppers website has not listed anyone wanted by the name of Isaac Don Burks for at least the last six years. The organization has not sought anyone for a crime similar to the one alleged online.\nOur ruling\nA website alleges a man has set out to infect as many people with HIV as possible and has infected up to 300 people already.\nThe article is fake. The New York City Health Department says it is made up. Authorities in New York City are not seeking Burks or anyone for such an allegation.\nIt\u2019s fake news.
