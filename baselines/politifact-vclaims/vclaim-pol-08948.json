Steve Stockman, R-Friendswood, said in a recent fundraising letter.\nThe letter, forwarded to PolitiFact by a reader Aug. 19, 2013, sought donations to the National Association for Gun Rights to battle \"the U.N.\u2019s \u2018Small Arms Treaty\u2019 \" and said that the treaty\u2019s provisions include \"mandating a new international gun registry.\"\nStockman also wrote that the treaty \"sets the stage for confiscation on a global scale.\" A \"gun registry\" might facilitate that by telling the United Nations where everybody\u2019s guns are. We wondered whether the treaty really creates a registry.\nWe did not hear back from Stockman or the association about this claim, so we were unable to determine when the letter was sent out or to verify it had not been altered. But the same claim appears on a web page at the association\u2019s site with a shorter version of the letter also attributed to Stockman.\nPolitiFact has looked at similar claims about the United Nations before, most recently finding that a letter supposedly outlining a U.N. plan to \"disarm civilians\" was fake. In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated as Pants on Fire a chain email saying the Obama administration planned to use international treaties to ban all U.S. weapons.\nAnd in August 2012, PolitiFact Georgia tackled a claim very similar to Stockman\u2019s. Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Broun said in a video from the same gun-rights group Stockman was supporting, \"If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to \u2026 create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation.\"\nPolitiFact Georgia rated that claim, including its implication of confiscating guns, as False. Among its findings: A July 27, 2012, draft of an Arms Trade Treaty that failed to gain U.N. members\u2019 approval would have required the U.S. to report information on international arms sales.\nSome background from that story: The U.N. has been working on a treaty to regulate the global arms trade -- not just small arms -- for years. Backers say it would curtail mass killings and terrorism and keep dictators from killing their own people.\nOn April 2, 2013, according to the U.N.\u2019s website, the organization\u2019s General Assembly \"adopted the landmark Arms Trade Treaty, regulating the international trade in conventional arms.\"\nThe U.S. said \"Yes\" in that vote, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said Jun. 3, 2013, that President Barack Obama planned to sign the treaty \"before the end of August,\" saying it was \"in the interest of the United States.\" For the treaty to take force in the U.S., it would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, which on March 23, 2013, voted 53-46 to insert its formal opposition to the treaty into Senate spending legislation.\nThe text of the treaty says its purpose is to regulate the international arms trade and prevent illicit sales and transfers. It applies to arms, ammunition and parts moving across a national border, specifically conventional arms in categories such as \"warships,\" \"combat aircraft\" and \"small arms and light weapons.\"\nThe treaty requires nations to deny authorization to exports of such armaments if they will be used for terrorism, to commit genocide, to attack civilians or in other war crimes, and to take \"appropriate measures\" if they detect that a shipment has been diverted.\nNations are required to maintain a \"national control system, including a national control list,\" report exports and imports to the U.N. each year and regulate brokering with measures that \"may include requiring brokers to register,\" but the treaty doesn\u2019t specify how countries must carry out these directions.\nDaniel Prins, chief of the Conventional Arms branch of the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs, told us by phone that the national control list will be \"an enumeration of the types of weapons you will report,\" starting with the categories in the treaty (warships, combat aircraft, etc.).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, each year, nations will report imports and exports in the categories on their lists, Prins said: \"35 tanks to Germany,\" for example.\nCountries can be more specific, but it\u2019s up to them, he said.\nThe treaty emphasizes that the U.N. is leaving regulation of the arms trade within a country entirely up to that country. The preamble says the parties to the treaty reaffirm \"the sovereign right of any state\" to regulate arms in its own territory \"pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system.\" It also says the parties are \"mindful of legitimate trade and lawful ownership.\"\nArticle 12 of the treaty requires member nations to keep records of exports and says each country \"is encouraged\" to keep records on arms transferred into or authorized to ship through \"territory under its jurisdiction.\" Countries are \"encouraged to include in those records\" the \"quantity, value, model/type,\" the exporting and importing countries and \"end users, as appropriate.\"\nStockman\u2019s letter includes some of the language in Article 12. Stockman wrote, \"The registry must include the \u2018quantity, value, model/type, authorized international transfers of conventional arms\u2019 and the identity of the \u2018end user.\u2019 \"\nBut in the treaty, recording those details is \"encouraged,\" not required. Though Article 12 deals primarily with exports, its language also encourages keeping records -- possibly including \"end users\" -- on arms transferred into a country.\nPrins said the importers, exporters and \"end users\" referred to in the treaty will most often be nations, not individuals.\n\"This is a treaty on conventional arms, so it\u2019s about battle tanks and attack helicopters and all that stuff,\" as well as small arms, Prins said. \"For each individual weapons system that you export, you want to see where that ends up and where it\u2019s being used.\"\nGiving a hypothetical example, he said, \"If you send that to Sudan and the next moment you see it actually popping up in Chad, then we have an \u2018end use\u2019 issue. Because if all went well, (Sudan has) signed an end-user certificate on that transaction,\" meaning \"they are supposed to be the last owner and user.\" If the weapons system were used by another country, that would be a breach of contract.\nHe said there should be no effect on, for example, a U.S. citizen buying a gun from a foreign broker because \"whatever broker you engage will need to be registered already with the U.S. government to be able to function as an arms broker.\" That\u2019s because the U.S. has some of the strongest arms import and export legislation in the world, he said.\nWith this treaty, Prins said, \"we\u2019re trying to get the world to adopt a transfer system that comes closer to what the U.S. already has.\"\nOur ruling\nStockman said a U.N. treaty is \u00a0\"mandating a new international gun registry.\" His claim takes a treaty intended to curtail illicit weapons trade between countries and describes it as a step toward confiscating gun owners\u2019 property.\nNations that ratify the Arms Trade Treaty must track conventional arms that move across their borders, share some information about the transfers with the U.N. and other countries, then report the imports and exports in broad categories such as \"battle tanks\" to the U.N. each year. They must also regulate brokers, but requiring them to \"register\" is optional. Recording details such as the quantity and model of weapons in a shipment is also optional.\nWe rate Stockman\u2019s claim as False.\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08948"}
