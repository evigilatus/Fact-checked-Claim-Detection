Accounts of small children being questioned by judges drew public outcry.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for disturbing reports to emerge: These children, some as young as one, were appearing as defendants in immigration court unaccompanied by their parents or even attorneys.\nOutraged, some people claimed the practice was new, ushered in by Donald Trump\u2019s administration alone.\nThat\u2019s wrong.\nAn image recently shared on Facebook is making that claim again, and features an image of a small child with the word \"ICE\" written across it, along with the seal for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\nAdditional text above and below the photo says, \"For the first time in the 242 year history of the United States of America \u2026 a one-year-old child appears in court as a defendant.\"\nThe photo was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere has been an increase in unaccompanied children appearing in immigration courts within the last year, and that may be due to the Trump administration\u2019s tough stance (as well as a record number of families attempting to cross the southern U.S. border) \u2013 but the practice itself is nothing new.\nMegan McKenna, senior director of communications and community engagement for Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), told PolitiFact that young children have been subjected to immigration proceedings for years.\n\"It\u2019s always been the case with children. It\u2019s been a different, evolving system but children of all ages have had to appear in immigration deportation proceedings,\" McKenna said. \"We have been referred kids as young as six months old prior to the Trump administration and also throughout it.\"\nThe Homeland Security Act of 2002\nThe Unaccompanied Alien Children program was created by law in 2002 when the Department of Homeland Security was established. It outlined the nation\u2019s approach to caring for and treating minors who have illegally entered the U.S. alone or who were separated from an adult.\nOn March 1, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred responsibilities for the care and custody of these children from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under the umbrella of Department of Health and Human Services.\nSince then, the ORR has cared for over 340,000 migrant children, according to the program\u2019s website. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnaccompanied minors are placed in facilities for 60 days, on average while they await their hearings. They can also be released to a relative or sponsor earlier.\nThese children are not guaranteed a right to an attorney, something that also predates the Trump administration.\nORR does offer services, indirectly, by contracting with the nonprofit Vera Institute for Justice, an organization that \"works to preserve the rights of tens of thousands of migrant children,\" according to its website. The Vera Institute partners with a network of legal service providers across the U.S. who inform migrant children of their rights under U.S. law and defend them in their legal proceedings as part of its Unaccompanied Children Program.\nWhile these nonprofits or law firms that offer pro bono services certainly help the children, McKenna says that many unaccompanied migrant children do not receive sufficient representation because the demand for attorneys willing to take these cases is so outmatched by attorney availability.\nFounded in 2008, lawyers at KIND started providing legal counsel to unaccompanied immigrant children in January 2009. According to a January 2018 report, the organization found that 50 percent of the children have had no one to represent them in immigration court, making them five times more likely to be deported. That lines up with data from TRAC, a Syracuse University clearinghouse for immigration research, that shows that, indeed, on average since 2005, roughly 52 percent of all children undergoing immigration court proceedings have had no representation.\nIn the years since Trump took office, the percentage of children who have had no one to represent them has steadily increased, just as the raw number of cases themselves have increased, according to TRAC. Unrepresented minors accounted for 32 percent of the children who faced deportation hearings in 2016, 50 percent in 2017, 60 percent in 2018 and 71 percent so far in 2019.\nAlso according to that data, 60,695 unaccompanied children faced deportation hearings in 2017, compared to 54,037 in 2016 and 32,536 in 2015.\nThere has also been a dramatic increase in infants and toddlers appearing in immigration proceedings under the Trump administration, data shows.\nIn July 2018, Kaiser Health News reported that 70 babies younger than age one had appeared for their own deportation proceedings from Oct. 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.\nThe number is up from the previous two years, which was 24 infants in all of fiscal year 2017 and 46 in fiscal year 2016. (Fiscal years run from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30)\nKaiser\u2019s report also said that, from the Justice Department data reviewed, a total of 1,500 unaccompanied children, from newborns to age 3, have been called in to immigration court since Oct. 1, 2015.\nOur ruling\nA viral image on social media makes the claim that a \"one-year-old appears in court as a defendant\" for the first time in U.S. history.\nRecent data does show a significant increase in the amount of young unaccompanied children appearing in immigration proceedings over the last fiscal year, but the practice was not implemented by the Trump administration \u2013 it\u2019s been in place for over a decade.\nWe rate this post False.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-26 18:29:44 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  For the first time in U.S. history, a one-year-old appears in court as a defendant.
