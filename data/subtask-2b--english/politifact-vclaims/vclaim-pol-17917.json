(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe post states that Pelosi ordered the Boeing 757 jet because the smaller Air Force C-20B jet that\u2019s normally made available to the House speaker could not make it across the country without stopping to refuel.\u00a0\nDid the speaker order this? And are taxpayers really paying almost $5.8 million annually for her to travel to and from work? The answer is no.\nA spokesperson for Pelosi told PolitiFact, \"Speaker Pelosi travels by commercial air. This is false.\"\u00a0\nPelosi did have acess to a\u00a012-seat Gulfstream V during her first stint as speaker, spokesperson Drew Hammill said, from 2007 to 2011, due to security precautions set in place following the Sept. 11 terror attacks. After that, however, she began routinely flying commercial flights. She became speaker again in January 2019.\nThe speaker has been spotted flying on commercial airlines recently. In July 2019, CNN\u2019s senior Washington correspondent, Jeff Zeleny, tweeted a photo of Pelosi sitting in coach on a Delta plane in Detroit.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Pelosi was negotiating the fine print of this budget deal from her aisle seat of a delayed Delta flight from Detroit. She\u2019s had the phone pressed to her ear for much of the last three hours. For those wondering, she\u2019s in coach. https://t.co/0W7xyy71qE pic.twitter.com/gYWs1gwtss\u2014 Jeff Zeleny (@jeffzeleny) July 22, 2019 \nThis isn\u2019t the first time this particular rumor was spread about Pelosi\u2019s flying habits.\u00a0\nWhen FactCheck.org reported on this claim in 2008, it found that the rumor dates back to 2007, when Pelosi first became speaker. Bill Livingood, then the House sergeant-at-arms, asked the Air Force and the Defense Department for a plane that could transport Pelosi across the country without stopping to refuel. The House sergeant-at-arms is the chamber\u2019s top law enforcement and security official.\nPelosi\u2019s predecessor, Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., had access to an Air Force C-20B, a small 12-seater that he used to travel to his home district, as well as a larger plane \u2014 a C-32, a military version of a Boeing 757 \u2014 that was made available to him following 9/11. But FactCheck.org found that while Livingood inquired about a plane that could fly across the country without stopping, Pelosi herself didn\u2019t request this larger jet \u2014 nor did she use it, Hammill said.\nIn 2010, FactCheck.org and PolitiFact also debunked claims of Pelosi raking up a $100,000 bar tab on her plane rides.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nA viral post on Facebook claims that Nancy Pelosi ordered a 200-seat Boeing 757 jet to fly from Washington, D.C., to San Francisco, costing taxpayers $5.8 million annually.\u00a0\nPelosi did not request such a plane. And the post leaves out important context that would explain why the U.S. government provided a larger plane for the speaker of the House. It also ignores the fact that Pelosi flies on commercial airlines.\u00a0\nWe rate this statement False.\u00a0\nCorrection (July 1, 2020): Pelosi had access to\u00a0a 12-seat Gulfstream V aircraft during her first term as speaker. An earlier version of this story incorrectly suggested she had access to and occassionally flew on a larger plane. This story has been updated to reflect that change. The ruling stands.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17917"}
