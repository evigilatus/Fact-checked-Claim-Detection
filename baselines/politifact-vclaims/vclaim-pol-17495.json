Production will cease as of June 31, 2020 and availability will be limited to stock on hand until it is deplenished.

Here\u2019s a few reasons we know that.\nFirst, if a popular soft drink, such as Mountain Dew, was being discontinued around the world it would have been reported by countless news organizations. So far, we found no credible reports that reflect this information.\nSecond, there has been no official statement released by the company on any product changes.\u00a0\nThird, there is no Chief Product Officer named \"Niwrad Eiknarf\" who works at PepsiCo. There\u2019s actually no Chief Product Officer listed on the company\u2019s website at all.\nFourth, there are only 30 days in June. Not 31 as the post claims.\nPants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17495"}
