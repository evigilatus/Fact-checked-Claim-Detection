What does exist is 6 million people whose right to vote has been taken away. To learn about them, I went to Florida, where retirees and democracy go to die.\"\nMeade, from Orlando, told Bee that in Florida, 1.68 million felons have lost the right to vote. And some of those felonies are less serious than others.\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter if it's a first degree or third degree. You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license,\" he said.\n\"Come on Florida,\" Bee replied, \"do you really want to be the Florida of everything?\"\nMeade has a point that not all the felonies that cost a person their right to vote are as egregious as murder or sexual assault.\nFor this fact-check, we wanted to know if driving with a suspended license could really cost a Floridian his or her civil rights, and how often it happens.\nRestoration of rights for felons is a hot topic in Florida, a swing state where any significant changes to the voting population can have a big impact. Research in a few states has shown that more felons after being released from prison register as Democrats than Republicans.\nAll felony convictions cost Floridians the right to vote\nIn April, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously approved language for a proposed amendment to restore voting rights to felons after they complete their sentences. The next hurdle for advocates including Meade is to collect about 700,000 signatures to place a question on the ballot in 2018. (Meade, a recovered drug addict, is among felons who have lost their civil rights: He served about three years in prison after a conviction for a 2001 firearm possession charge.)\nThe proposed amendment calls for restoring voting rights for felons automatically once they have completed their sentences including parole or probation. Automatic restoration would not apply to felons convicted of murder or sexual offenses, who would still have to ask the Florida Cabinet and Gov. Rick Scott to restore their rights in a slow and cumbersome process.\nWhile the policy extends back to the Jim Crow era and makes Florida an outlier nationally, there have been efforts to make the process easier. In 2007 under then-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, felons convicted of less serious offenses could regain their rights without a hearing after finishing their sentences. However, in 2011, the Republican Cabinet, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Gov. Rick Scott scrapped that process and set a minimum of a five-year waiting period.\nSince 2011 through April 1, 2017, about 2,600 felons have gotten their rights restored while more than 10,000 cases are pending. That means that felons don\u2019t necessarily lose their rights for the rest of their life, but it\u2019s a long and cumbersome process and ultimately the Cabinet can deny restoring someone\u2019s rights.\nThe Florida Constitution (section 4a) states:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No person convicted of a felony, or adjudicated in this or any other state to be mentally incompetent, shall be qualified to vote or hold office until restoration of civil rights or removal of disability.\"\nThat broadly applies to all types of felonies, experts said.\n\"Any felony conviction in Florida, no matter how small or seemingly trivial, results in the loss of your civil rights,\" said Randall Berg of the Florida Justice Institute.\nMeade sent PolitiFact the statute about the penalties for driving with a suspended license in Florida. The law states that a first or second offense is a misdemeanor but a third or subsequent conviction is a third-degree felony.\nWe were unable to find any data on how many people had lost their rights based on particular statutes.\u00a0\nThat makes it difficult to quantify which statutes most commonly, or infrequently, result in loss of rights.\nWe were able to get data on the number of felony convictions for driving with a suspended license. There were 6,759 felony convictions between 2012 and 2016, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\nAdvocates in favor of restoring rights to felons pointed to some other felonies that don\u2019t exactly conjure up the image of threatening lawbreakers.\nBee\u2019s show highlighted some of those statutes, such as tampering with a lobster trap or an odometer -- both felonies, although they rarely result in convictions.\nTake the case, for example, of the man a state trooper said violated a rarely-prosecuted felony pollution statute when Anthony Brasfield released a dozen heart-shaped balloons in Broward around Valentine\u2019s Day in 2013.\nBroward prosecutors didn\u2019t file a case based on that statute, in part because prosecutors thought the jury would likely see this as a romantic gesture rather than a criminal act. Brasfield ultimately pled guilty to a lesser offense: a misdemeanor for driving while his license was suspended.\nHoward Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, pointed to a few additional felony statutes, including knowingly presenting a counterfeit or altered state lottery ticket or trespassing on posted commercial horticultural property \nOur ruling\nMeade said, \"It doesn\u2019t matter if it's a first degree or third degree. You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license,\" he said.\nThe Florida Constitution says people convicted of felonies cannot vote until their civil rights are restored, a process that takes years after felons complete their sentences and is ultimately up to the Florida Cabinet and governor.\nMeade omits an important caveat about the Florida statute specifically about driving with a suspended license: the first and second convictions are misdemeanors, so the crime only becomes a felony upon the third or subsequent conviction.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-26 13:21:33 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license\" in Florida.
