Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is a member of the bipartisan Gang of Eight senators pushing for comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n\nGraham has repeatedly used his state\u2019s labor issues to justify guest worker programs for low-skilled and agricultural workers.\n\n\n\"Nobody wants to displace a willing American worker, but I can tell you in South Carolina there are certain jobs, like in the meatpacking industry, that as an employer you can advertise all day long every day of the week and you\u2019re not going to get that workforce,\" Graham said during a February 2013 Senate hearing.\n\n\nThe senator made similar comments to a South Carolina Rotary Club. \"When you go to these meatpacking plants in Saluda (S.C.), harvesting the crops or servicing the hotels along the coast, you may not believe it, but it is true -- there is a shortage of labor in some parts of our economy, even though we have high unemployment,\" Graham said.\n\n\nWe wanted to know whether Graham\u2019s comments about a labor shortage in some areas were correct.\n\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s jobless rate is higher than the national rate. That state and Georgia\u2019s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March. The national rate was 7.6 percent.\n\n\nSo why would jobs go unfilled? The issue may be one of wages, not workers, said Steve Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Real wages in meat/poultry processing have declined about 40 percent in the last 30 years. These are not the lowest-paying jobs, but they are nasty, not pleasant work,\" he said. \"If the job pays dramatically less than it previously did, that means there is a wage issue and not a jobs issue.\"\n\n\nThe national average hourly wage for slaughterers and meatpackers was $11.99 in May 2012. In South Carolina, the average hourly wage was $11.36. In 2010, the national hourly wage for the job was $11.55; South Carolina\u2019s wage was $8.81.\n\n\nBecause of the nature of the work and the pay, the jobs may not attract enough applicants, said Mark Grey, an anthropology professor and director of the Iowa Center for Immigrant Leadership and Integration. The nonprofit, nonpartisan center at the University of Northern Iowa notes that its programs incorporate \"a strong appreciation for the critical role newcomers play\" in the state\u2019s economy.\n\n\n\"(Meatpacking) wages have increased, but still at $16 per hour (on the high end), the job would probably not be appealing to anybody with any kind of education,\" he said.\n\n\nIn Saluda County, S.C. -- the area mentioned by Graham -- the unemployment rate for residents with less than a high school diploma was 19.1 percent in 2011, the most recent federal data available. The rate dropped to 10.9 percent for high school graduates with no college. Statewide unemployment that year was 10.5 percent.\n\n\nTo sum up, research shows that South Carolina\u2019s unemployment is almost a full percentage point higher than the national average, and the rate for lower-educated residents is even higher. But in the meatpacking industry, the nature of the work and the wages often turn off many American workers, those on both sides of the immigration debate said.\n\n\nGraham said that there was a problem filling certain jobs, even amid high unemployment. But his statement lacks context about wages and conditions in the meatpacking industry. We rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09386"}
