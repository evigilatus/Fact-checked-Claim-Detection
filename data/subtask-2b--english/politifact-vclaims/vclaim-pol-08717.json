Abele\u2019s 2014 budget proposal is awaiting action by the County Board.\nFirst stop, the county\u2019s capital budget book.\nThe book contains the official numbers on capital improvements, which in the Parks Department include things such as fixing leaky pools, building new picnic shelters, paving parkways, replacing walkways and other major work.\nGoing back 10 years puts you at 2004, two years into Walker\u2019s tenure as county executive. We found four years with higher budgeted totals than 2013 -- all predating Abele.\nThere is one wrinkle: Under Walker, the county doubled up its borrowing for capital improvements in 2009 and 2010 -- in effect borrowing for four years, including 2011 and 2012 too. That was so it could get federal subsidies to lower its normal borrowing costs, under President Barack Obama\u2019s economic stimulus plan.\nAdjusting for that by spreading that over four years, we actually found six years in the decade with a higher parks capital budget than 2013.\nAnother way to look at it\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we asked Abele spokesman Brendan Conway for backup on the exec\u2019s claim, he provided a 2013 parks capital budget figure that was more than double the amount in the budget book.\nConway said it included parks-related projects and major maintenance that is spread around the county budget but not tallied under parks capital because other departments supervise the work. For example: Road construction on a county parkway.\nAbele\u2019s not the first county executive to pull together the numbers that way. In fact, county finance officials told us it\u2019s a legitimate alternative.\nBut the list itself was a bit too broad. It included, for instance, a tally for countywide sanitary sewer repairs ordered by the state.\nWhat\u2019s more, Conway didn\u2019t provide any prior years for comparison.\nSo we asked the county official in charge of capital finance, Pamela Bryant, to use Abele\u2019s method to generate a decade\u2019s worth of numbers.\nBryant works for the independently elected county comptroller, Scott Manske. Before running her analysis, she conferred with Abele\u2019s office and they came to an agreement on what to include using the broader method, Bryant told us.\nBryant developed two tables that dealt with the \"double borrowing\" issue in different ways.\nIn one table, 2007 and 2010 parks-related capital spending outpaced 2013.\nIn the other, there were three years in which parks-related capital spending was higher than in 2013.\nIt wasn\u2019t close in two instances.\nIn 2011 (Walker\u2019s last budget) and 2012, the spending was about $4 million to $7 million higher than the $14.8 million in 2013. As we mentioned, that was the first budget over which Abele had total control over capital spending due to the stimulus-related borrowing for 2012.\nIn addition, the 2007 budget was just a shade over Abele\u2019s 2013 mark, though if inflation were factored in, the gap would grow.\nOur rating\nAbele told Rotarians that Milwaukee County has a \"parks capital budget that\u2019s bigger than it\u2019s been in the last 10 years.\"\nBy any measure, this claim misses the mark. While Abele\u2019s 2013 budget funded parks capital at a higher level than at least six other budgets in the decade, it\u2019s not close to the leader.\nWe rate his claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08717"}
