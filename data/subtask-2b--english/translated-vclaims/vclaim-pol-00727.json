Patrick said that the media were part of the problem and did not provide adequate coverage for such tragedies as human trafficking or the death of people trying to enter the country. The farmers at the border had discovered the remains of more than 1,000 migrants on their property - evidence of the current border crisis. \"since 2011, we have documents from 1,671 bodies we recovered in Texas, a lot in Brooks County,\" said Patrick. \"Look at the pictures. ....................................................................................... It seems like something we might see in a third-world country where there were some civil wars in the dust. There are thousands and thousands and thousands there. This is just the ones we've seen, over millions of acres.\" Press reports have detailed the dangerous journey that many people are trying to make as they cross the border and sometimes the terrible fate that awaits them. The news outlets also picked up what happened after the bodies were discovered, while researchers were trying to identify individuals. But is his claim about the number of bodies discovered since 2011 accurate? According to border patrol data, Patrick Alejandro Garcia, Patrick &apos; s spokesman, claims data maintained by United States Customs and Border Patrols showing recorded deaths in the south-western border area each year from 1998 to 2018. The majority of recorded deaths are cases where the remains of a person suspected of illegally entering the country were exposed to extreme heat or cold while attempting to cross vast land with few sources of water and discovered near the border between the United States and Mexico, according to a spokesman for the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. This report does not cover individuals who died while in the custody of the Customs and Border Protection Office or who died during their arrest. Nor does it include deaths at ports of entry or detention facilities. Between 1998 and 2018, 7,505 deaths across the entire United States-Mexico border were recorded, according to the report. Of these, there were 3,125 in Texas. There were 244 deaths in the El Paso sector, which includes El Paso and the entire state of New Mexico. However, Patrick &apos; s claim looked at a more limited time frame: bodies discovered since 2011. From 2011 to 2018, CBP data show that 2,773 bodies were discovered along the entire border. Of these, 1,641 were in Texas. There were also 30 in the El Paso sector. What about Brooks County? Patrick said that many of these deaths were recorded in Brooks County, 942 square miles just north of the Hidalgo Border Province. The province is covered by farm land and includes live oaks, cookies, brushes and cocktails. From 2009 to 2019, 642 bodies were discovered in the province, according to data provided by the sheriff &apos; s office. These figures are included in the figures of the Customs and Border Protection Bureau, which, according to Maggie Sains, looks at the entire border, the administrative assistant at the sheriff's office. Brooks County is one of the deadliest places for people crossing the border illegally. An investigation conducted by The New York Times in 2017 found that immigrants travelled through the brush in this province to avoid busy checkpoints for border patrol traffic in Hyperonville and Valforias. When people try to walk around checkpoints, often without enough food or water, they die after facing cold in winter and heat in the summer. Sanz used to help supervise the recovery of remains and help maintain the office's stock of recovered remains. In an interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"dropped more water in Houston in five days than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" Since then, the number has fluctuated from 61 in 2016 to 52 in 2017 and 50 in 2018. So far this year, the sheriff &apos; s office has recorded eight deaths, the lowest number reported in the first four months of the year since 2010, with three deaths recorded between January and April and 20 deaths recorded throughout the year. The remains discovered in Brooks County accounted for more than 33 per cent of all bodies discovered in Texas since 2009. The recorded figures do not tell the whole story that law enforcement officials are not actively searching for bodies, but often receive telephone calls from farm owners who see human remains on their property. \"They know what they're looking for, unfortunately, because many people are dying,\" said Lori Baker, a professor of anthropology at Baylor University, which founded united families, a program that helps government agencies recover and identify the remains of migrants found along the United States-Mexico border. She said, \"On the southern border, people used to think they might find someone who didn't survive or who might be in distress.\" Baker, who had been working to identify the remains of immigrants since 2003, said the figures reported by the Customs and Border Protection Office or even locally were \"very incomplete estimates\" of the number of people dying trying to enter the country. \"Most individuals who die may go unrecovered,\" she said, pointing out that animals can disperse remains, making it difficult to find them on vast areas of land. There is also a problem with data collection in general, as there is no government agency or group actively engaged in finding bodies. Limited resources at the local level prevent law enforcement officials from giving priority to this work, and there has been little interest at the national level in funding these efforts. There are other roadblocks in Texas, where much of the land on or near the border is privately owned. This creates a range of problems when it comes to third parties looking for bodies, as landowners tend to prevent these groups from entering their property. And when they're allowed into some property, they have another problem: the earth's expansion. Baker said that since August she had worked on the case of a woman looking for her mother, who had reportedly died while trying to cross the border in South Texas. \"We couldn't find her, even though the people who travelled with her described where they left her,\" said Baker. But she's on a big farm like this. Baker also said it was possible that local entities did not report all human remains to the Customs and Border Protection Office, as there were no explicit requirements for sharing such information. Some international groups - such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - also track these deaths, but their numbers are even lower than those reported by the Customs and Border Protection Office. Our rule, Patrick, said, \"since 2011, we have documents on 1,671 bodies recovered in Texas, many in Brooks County.\" This high number of deaths has been recorded by the United States Border Patrol since 2011 in Texas and even more along the entire border. The number of deaths recorded has been declining in recent years. These deaths do not provide an accurate picture of the number of migrants who die as they try to enter the country - the real number is likely to be much higher. But Patrick's claim is correct. Only 1,671 bodies have been documented in Texas, and many of them are from Brooks County. We're assessing this claim right. The truth is - the statement is accurate and nothing important is missing.
