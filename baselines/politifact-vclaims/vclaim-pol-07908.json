Gregory has promised to find a new place to live since getting an earful from some Catholics -- and unwelcome national attention -- about his new 6,186-square-foot, $2.2 million residence on Habersham Road in Buckhead.\nIn a statement he issued March 31, the archbishop said he had no desire to move to the Tudor-style mansion in the first place.\n\"However, the Cathedral parish has a problem, albeit a happy one,\" he said. \"The Cathedral of Christ the King is one of our largest, most vibrant and fastest-growing parishes \u2014 but it is landlocked.\"\nPolitiFact deemed the archbishop\u2019s statement worthy of a fact check, given all the hoopla.\nA review of some numbers, as well as some number crunching, should settle the questions: Is it one of the largest of the 99 Catholic churches that are part of the Archdiocese of Atlanta? And is it one of the fastest-growing?\nWe requested membership data for at least five years. But the bulk of what we received was from 2012 and 2013. And looking at that data and limited information that was provided from 1997, the answer to each question is yes.\nAccording to the Official Catholic Directory, the Cathedral of Christ the King was the second-largest church in the archdiocese in 1997, based on the number of families, or households. It had 3,505 at the time.\nFast-forward to 2013, and the cathedral on Peachtree Road in Buckhead was the archdiocese\u2019s third-largest parish, with 4,842 families. Only St. Michael\u2019s in Gainesville and St. Thomas the Apostle in Smyrna were larger, with 7,054 and 6,844 families, respectively.\nThe cathedral\u2019s congregation grew 9.6 percent between summer 2012 and summer 2013, adding 426 families, according to the archdiocese\u2019s data. By our calculations, that made it the archdiocese\u2019s 15th-fastest-growing of all the churches that year and, among the bigger churches, the second-fastest-growing.\nSt. Joseph\u2019s in Dalton grew the most, 23.2 percent or 509 families, while more than 30 parishes in the archdiocese had virtually no growth or lost families in that same time, the data show.\nThe cathedral was built in French Gothic architectural style and named \"the most beautiful building in Atlanta\" by Architectural Record in 1939, two years after its completion. Some would say it remains a contender today.\nMembers of the parish come from more than 150 ZIP codes in metro Atlanta. Priests at the cathedral presided over more than 1,200 daily Masses, 624 weekend Masses, more than 500 Baptisms, 128 weddings and 49 funerals in 2013. Seven adult choirs and four children\u2019s choirs chimed in at many of these events.\nThe cathedral became part of the recent controversy after Joseph Mitchell, a parishioner at Christ the King and the nephew of \"Gone With the Wind\" author Margaret Mitchell, left $15 million and his home on tony Habersham Road to the archdiocese.\nMitchell requested that the archdiocese use the inheritance for \"general religious and charitable purposes.\" He also asked that Christ the King get primary consideration.\nThe cathedral was given $7.5 million for its building program and spent $1.9 million of that to buy the archbishop\u2019s longtime residence nearby on West Wesley Road.\nThe goal was to convert the archbishop\u2019s old home into a rectory, or residence, for the cathedral\u2019s six priests. That would allow the rectory that\u2019s on the cathedral\u2019s campus to eventually be replaced with worship and meeting space. (The cathedral is effectively landlocked. It\u2019s surrounded by streets on three sides, and it is restricted from developing on its east side for 20 years. That was part of a deal negotiated with the neighborhood that allowed the church to develop a youth recreation area.)\nMeanwhile, Mitchell\u2019s home on Habersham Road was torn down. In its place and with part of the proceeds from the sale of the West Wesley residence, the archbishop\u2019s new $2.2 million mansion was built, equipped with two dining rooms, an elevator and a second-floor safe, or panic room.\nGregory, long-rumored to be a candidate on the short list to succeed soon-to-be-retiring Chicago Bishop Francis George, moved to the new residence on Habersham in January.\nHe initially defended the move, which critics said went against Pope Francis\u2019 call for modest living. He later apologized.\n\"I am disappointed that, while my advisers and I were able to justify this project fiscally, logistically and practically, I personally failed to project the cost in terms of my own integrity and pastoral credibility with the people of God of north and central Georgia,\" Gregory wrote.\nThe archbishop promised to sell the house and move elsewhere. We\u2019re told that\u2019s still the plan today.\nIn summary: We decided to fact-check the archbishop\u2019s statement largely on two points: Is the Cathedral of Christ the King one of the archdiocese\u2019s largest churches? And is it one of the diocese\u2019s fastest-growing churches.\nThe data we were provided say yes. But they allowed only a limited comparison, and the information could not be independently verified.\nWe rate the archbishop\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 parishes in 2013\n\n\n1997 Registration Data\n\n\n2013 Registration Data\n\n\n% Growth\n\n\n# Growth\n\n\n\n\nSt. Michael, Gainesville\n\n\n1,500\n\n\n7,054\n\n\n370%\n\n\n5,554\n\n\n\n\nSt. Thomas the Apostle\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConservative Beaver\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Pope Francis \u201cwas arrested Saturday in connection with an 80-count indictment of charges including possession of child pornography, human trafficking, incest, possession of drug paraphernalia and felony fraud.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y.
