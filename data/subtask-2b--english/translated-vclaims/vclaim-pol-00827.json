However, despite an enhanced majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, democratic leaders in the legislature said that carbon pricing was not on their agenda in 2019. When Progress finally introduced its carbon tax bills in February, Speaker Mitzi Johnson, the South Champion, said it was too late. The Committee on Roads and Means at Home decided last week to increase taxes on domestic heating fuel to raise funds for low-income Vermont to clean their homes, making the buildings healthier and less expensive to live in, as well as more environmentally friendly. Thus, a discussion began in the State Council of Vermont on whether the Law on Home Weather, H.439, was a carbon tax in another name. The Republic of Christopher Matus, R-Milton, proposed to amend the language change in the bill to name it \"fuel carbon tax\" to make it clear. During the debate in the Chamber of Deputies, Mr. Scott Beck of R. St. Jonesbury spoke in support of the Matus amendment. \"My lady speaker: Vermont deserves transparency,\" he said. \"Fuel tax is a tax on carbon heating fuel, with revenues used to reduce carbon use. It's a carbon tax whether it's appropriate to say it or not.\" Republic George Till, De-Gericio, said Beck was wrong. \"This is not a carbon tax. The carbon tax is based on the amount of carbon released when fuel is burned. Here we have taxes based on gallons purchased,\" he said. The purpose of the carbon tax was to change behaviour. \"The purpose of this bill is to change buildings to reduce the money spent on heating and cooling and to improve people's health.\" Is the fuel tax carbon tax or not? We decided to try to cut the noise and come up with an answer. The carbon tax is often defined as a carbon incineration tax, calculated on the basis of the carbon weight generated. The tax is explicitly designed as an economic tool to reduce carbon emissions. The Oxford Journal of the Environment and Nature Conservation defines the carbon tax as: \"An additional tax or tax on the sale of fossil fuels (oil, coal and gas) varies according to the carbon content of each fuel and is designed to discourage the use of fossil fuels and reduce CO2 emissions.\" The Weather Act of the State House in Vermont increases the tax on propane, kerosene and domestic heating oil from two to four cents per gallon. While it applies only to carbon-containing fossil fuels, the tax rate is not based on carbon content. If that were the case, the tax rate for each fuel would be different. Propane exports 139.05 pounds of CO2 per million British thermal units (puto), a commonly used account. The kerosene exports 159.40 pounds of CO2 per million bits, and heat oil sends 161.30 pounds of CO2/million bits. In one of his interviews on 31 January 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"dropped water in Houston in five days more than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" According to Brandon Mulder's logic on 5 February 2021, the fuel tax applies to carbon heating fuel and 2) uses revenues to reduce carbon use, and therefore 3 is the carbon tax. The first two points are correct, but the tax is still on fuel, not carbon. It should certainly be noted that the tax applies only to carbon-based heating methods, rather than wood heat or electricity, which can come from wind, hydro or solar energy. In this way, the draft law can serve as a slight deterrent against the use of traditional carbon-emitting fuels. However, other supporters noted that the bill was not aimed at discouraging the use of fossil fuels and reducing CO2 emissions. The two explicit carbon tax bills introduced this year impose on each ton 5 dollars of carbon content in fiscal year 2021, and then gradually raise the tax - one to $40 by fiscal year 2028 and the other to $50 by fiscal year 2030. This number reaches about 14 to 17 cents per gallon when the tax peaks. However, a study commissioned by Vermont and conducted by Resources for the Future found that even at those levels, carbon pricing would not cause significant changes in consumer behaviour. \"The uses of transport fuel and heating are relatively unsensitive (or inflexible) to moderate changes in fuel prices; emissions in these sectors are not expected to decrease significantly in response to the carbon pricing levels considered here.\" The draft Weather Adjustment Act, taken as a whole, is similar to carbon tax schemes in that it is designed to reduce carbon emissions by channelling tax revenues to household enterprises that reduce the amount of energy needed to keep the population warm. (Resources for the Future report indicates that the carbon tax will be effective in reducing emissions only if revenues are returned to carbon reduction initiatives. It should also be noted that there are other, less common, definitions of carbon tax. The carbon tax centre, which calls for carbon pricing, says that \"carbon tax is a charge on carbon-based fuel combustion (coal, oil and gas). The Cambridge dictionary defines it as \"a tax on the use of fuel that produces gases harmful to the atmosphere.\" It is easier to include the proposed heating fuel tax in those definitions, but it is still widespread. Our President, Governor Scott Beck, R. Johnsonbury, said: \"It's a carbon tax whether it's appropriate to say it or not.\" The heating fuel tax achieves some of the same carbon tax targets, such as increasing the cost of fossil fuels to reduce carbon emissions. But the tax is not high enough to be an important deterrent. While the draft law may appear to be a carbon tax, it is not a carbon tax in a literal sense, which is clearly reflected in the fact that fuels with different levels of carbon emissions are taxed at the same rate. It is therefore not a carbon tax. We appreciate that Beck's claim is mostly false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00827"}
