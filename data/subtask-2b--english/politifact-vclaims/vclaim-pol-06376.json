He added the change followed years of increasing the state\u2019s cash reserves from $1 billion to $10 billion.\nA state getting its bond rating upgraded is a relatively rare occurrence, so we wondered whether Florida was the only state to jump to a top rating while Bush was in office from 1999-2006.\nGetting an upgrade \u00a0\nFor this analysis, we\u2019re focusing on the state\u2019s general obligation bond rating -- that is, an expert analysis of a state\u2019s ability to pay its debts.\nThis rating, which is kind of like a person\u2019s credit score, is formulated by three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services, Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Each reports their ratings differently, but Bush\u2019s Right to Rise political action committee spokesman Matt Gorman told us he was referring specifically to the S&P analysis.\nGorman shared a Pew Charitable Trusts infographic that showed \"S&P state credit ratings\" from 2001 to 2014. The infographic shows that Florida was the only state between 2001 and 2006 to make the ratings leap Bush specified (AA to AAA).\nOn Feb. 25, 2005, S&P upgraded Florida\u2019s general obligation bond rating from AA+ (which is slightly higher than their AA rating, actually) to AAA. The difference is in rating the state\u2019s capacity to meet its debt obligations from \"very strong\" to \"extremely strong,\" according to agency guidelines. For the record, Moody\u2019s and Fitch also upgraded the state that year, but their ratings are designated differently.\nS&P\u2019s report on the upgrade said the decision was \"based on the state's strong and conservative financial and budget management practices, coupled with substantial budget reserves and economic trends that have been among the strongest nationally.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Nelson\n\n\nstated on June 11, 2009 in during a U.S. Senate debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 October 5, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also cited stable state revenue, a moderate debt burden and a service-based economy that was growing faster than the national average as among other reasons for the upgrade. S&P\u2019s analysis said Florida\u2019s outlook was stable due to \"the state's strong budget reserves and demonstrated track record of active budget management and long-term planning and forecasting.\"\nBush wants to take credit for this budget management, and he could lay some claim to the idea. He was well-known during his tenure for regularly using the line-item veto to discard hundreds of millions in spending on budgeted projects Bush deemed wasteful or that didn\u2019t follow his agenda. Taking the red pen to the Legislature\u2019s final budgets helped build the state\u2019s cash reserves from $1.3 billion to $9.8 billion by 2006, so Bush\u2019s numbers there are pretty accurate. The Legislature actively socked cash away in state coffers during this time.\nSo, yes, Florida was the only state to make the jump looking at data between 2001 and 2014.\nBut there\u2019s one problem: Bush became governor in 1999.\u00a0Those two years make a big difference.\nWe asked S&P for its history of state ratings and found two instances that counter Bush\u2019s claim: On Feb. 22, 2000, S&P upgraded Delaware from AA+ to AAA. On Sept. 27, 2000, the agency did the same for Michigan. (It was downgraded back to AA+ in 2003.)\nFlorida, for the record, still enjoys the AAA rating it earned in 2005, with an outlook S&P now considers stable.\nOur ruling\nBush said, \"Florida was the only state during my eight years to go from AA to AAA (in its bond rating).\"\nFlorida\u2019s general obligation bond rating was upgraded by Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services in 2005. But both Delaware and Michigan were upgraded from AA+ to AAA by the S&P in 2000, which was during Bush\u2019s second year in office. The information Bush\u2019s PAC cited did not include his first two years in office.\nWe rate his statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06376"}
