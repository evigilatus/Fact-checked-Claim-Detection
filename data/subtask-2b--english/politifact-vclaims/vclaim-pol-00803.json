The allegation fueled old claims that Biden, a likely presidential candidate, behaves inappropriately with women. It also inspired some new, supposed photo evidence of such behavior.\nIn one picture, posted on Facebook on March 31, Biden appears to be kissing a woman a few feet behind U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham. But the image is doctored, and the post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe original image is a still of a video by Daily Caller columnist Benny Johnson. Johnson recorded Graham walking away from a woman protesting Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, according to Johnson\u2019s Oct. 5 story. Biden is not in the picture.\nIn the doctored photo, the woman has her mouth open like she is screaming or gasping in surprise. But watching the recording, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s yelling at Graham.\n\"We are voting you out of office,\" she says as Graham adjusts his tie and smiles for the camera.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of that moment has become a meme (examples here and here).
