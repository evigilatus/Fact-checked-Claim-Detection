The former President of the National Democratic Commission helped launch the campaign for the re-election of Del. Scott Sorville, De Fairfax, on the 7 May march. During the introductory remarks, Makulev criticized a plan to borrow $1.8 billion for transportation from the Government of the Republic. Bob McDonnell was pushed through the legislature. \"The $1.8 billion in borrowing, we didn't even have a payment mechanism, and people,\" said McCullivi. A big borrowing plan with no way to pay the money? Is that really what the state did? We decided to check. A transfer plan for borrowing up to $300 million per year for 10 years was approved in 2007. However, stagnation and legal challenges delayed the issuance of the first bonds until May 2010. What McDonnell and the General Assembly did this winter was speed up the sale of previously authorized bonds so that $600 million could be sold annually over the next three years. John Lawson, Chief Finance Officer of the Department of Transport of Virginia, said that the state was still planning to issue a full $3 billion bond, but in a shorter period of time. Both McDonnell and the democracy Tim Kane, who signed the 2007 plan, presented the same payment plan. The 2007 Bill has instructed that one third of the State &apos; s revenue from premium taxes be allocated to debt repayment. This part is almost equal to the annual income portion of insurance premium taxes from vehicle policies. McCullough told us he knew the state had a payment plan. He said that he was \"adamantly\" arguing with the State that there was no debt repayment plan because he did not believe that politicians had developed a \"realistic payment mechanism.\" He told us in an e-mail that the case is \"Double\" the amount of debt that comes out, but in fact, Virginia issues the same amount of debt in half the time. Makulev also said that he was concerned that one third of the revenue from the premium tax would not cover new State borrowing of roads. Tax revenue from premiums had fallen below projections in 2009 and 2010. We have been told by Rick Brown, State Finance Minister under Cain and McDonnell that one third of the insurance tax will be net for the 2011 budget year ending 30 June. This number increased from $128 million in 2010, as Brown said. The proceeds of the insurance tax account for about 85 per cent of the priority transport fund, the State warehouse of revenues required for the payment of road bonds. The Treasury also receives funds from a government tax on the wholesale price of gas paid by service station owners, as well as interest on its cash balances. In total, Virginia experienced a revenue flow of $152.2 million to the Fund during the 2010 budget year and is expected to reach $154.5 million this year, according to a briefing by Minister of Transport Sean Konaton to the Committee of Appropriations of the House of Representatives in January. Konatun and Brown both say that the fund will take enough money each year to repay the accelerated loan. Between 2011 and 2017, the State expects to deposit an annual income of approximately $224.8 million into the Fund. The average debt payments during those years are expected to be about $175.7 million. These forecasts give the mandate a great deal of freedom, even if actual revenues are below expectations. Let's go over it. Terry McCullough said Virginia was taking $1.8 billion in transfer debt without any payment plan. He's wrong. In 2007, the General Assembly allocated one third of the tax revenue to the insurance premiums for debt repayment. Taxes on petrol in bulk also go to bond payments. All that has been said, the State has set aside the annual revenue to repay the loan, which is 28% higher than the expected borrowing costs. Makulev is not the first democracy to make this allegation. The President of the State party, Brian Moran, obtained fire pants in January to say that McDonnell had no payment plan. While serving on the Board of Delegates, Moran voted in favour of the two draft laws that allocate car insurance taxes to transport debt payments. By saying that the State \"did not have a payment mechanism,\" Makulev misled the electorate. He admitted to us that he knew all along that there was a payment plan. We assess his claim of pants on fire. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech.
