We are sure the claim wasn't intended as a joke, because it's included in a bullet-point list of straightforward criticisms of the law.\nSo let\u2019s start by looking at the claim literally. Is there any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would prevent U.S.-trained doctors from accepting \"Obamacare\" patients -- that is, patients who secure insurance through the marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the law?\nWe feel comfortable, both from talking to experts and from our years of reporting on the law, that there is no such provision. If there were, it would probably be ripe for challenge on constitutional grounds.\nIn fact, when we asked experts for their reaction to this claim, their responses included words such as \"outrageous,\" \"ridiculous\" and \"ludicrous.\"\n\"Of course there's nothing in the law that would bar any doctor from seeing any patient,\" said Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health.\nSo, no dice on the literal reading of her claim.\nStill, we wondered whether there was some other tiny, buried grain of truth in what Coulter claimed. Is the idea that American-trained doctors will be pickier about accepting insurance?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some evidence that medical practices are wary about taking patients from plans sold on the marketplace. In September, the Medical Group Management Association -- a trade group for medical-practice executives -- surveyed 1,000 physician groups that collectively employ 47,500 doctors.\nThe survey asked, among other things, \"Does your practice plan to participate with any new health insurance products sold on an ACA exchange?\" Only 29 percent of respondents gave a definitive \"yes.\" That rate is twice as high as the share that that said \"no\" (14 percent) but less than those that were still weighing their options (40 percent).\nThe top reasons? A fear of bureaucratic regulations, low reimbursement rates and the need to collect payment from patients with higher deductibles.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that this study is not evidence that can be used to support Coulter\u2019s specific claim, because it says nothing about foreign-trained doctors.\nIn fact, the closer you look at the issue of foreign-trained doctors, the less plausible Coulter\u2019s claim becomes.\nAccording to a 2010 study by the American Medical Association, about 26 percent of physicians in the United States were trained in other countries. This number includes both foreign-born doctors who trained overseas and Americans who received their medical education in other countries.\nBut tough licensing requirements for foreign-trained doctors -- requirements that won\u2019t be changed by Obama\u2019s law -- are keeping the number of foreign-trained physicians low. A key barrier is the need to obtain a residency in the United States, even if an applicant had practiced or had a residency overseas.\nAccording to the New York Times, just 42 percent of foreign-trained immigrant physicians who applied for residencies through the leading matching service succeeded, compared to 94 percent of those who had trained in the United States.\nWith such high barriers to entry, it\u2019s not credible that a flood of foreign-trained doctors will suddenly swoop in and, without the help of a single American-trained doctor, serve each one of the newly insured patients who bought policies on the new marketplaces.\n\"I haven't seen any study that would suggest that American-trained doctors would be disproportionately less likely to see the newly insured,\" Baicker said.\nAnd even if there were such evidence, \"disproportionate is a far cry from \u2018none,\u2019 \" said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. \"There is no limit to the nonsense that some are saying. This borders on the absurd.\"\nOur ruling\nCoulter said that \"no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare.\" Nothing in the law bars American-trained physicians from treating newly insured people under Obamacare. It\u2019s a ridiculous claim -- one with a whiff of xenophobia -- that merits a Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08751"}
