He's wrong.", "text": "President Donald Trump, armed with spaghetti models and a mustache map, defended his efforts to declare that Alabama was once ready to face the wrath of Hurricane Dorian. He even went so far as to say that there was a possibility that Alabama would be 95 percent on the hurricane road. But Trump receipts don't check. This is the story of how the President rocked government models from the storm to blow predictions away from proportionality and tell Americans. The White House did not answer our questions, but by the end of the day, the White House issued a statement from Navy Admiral Peter J. Brown, Adviser on Internal Security and Counter-Terrorism, who defended Trump. Brown said that Trump shared spaghetti models that showed potential effects of storms outside the official predictive cone and that forecasts showed the potential of tropical storm winds to hit Alabama. Over the course of several days, Trump heard criticism from the media and meteorologists about his weekend warnings that even Alabama would \"get a piece of\" Dorian or \"probably hit\" more difficult than expected.\" Therefore, as he updated the correspondents in September 4, he asked the Acting Minister of Internal Security, Kevin K. Macalinan, to present a chart of \"original\" forecasts. # Charbigit was born: The cone of the hurricane was expanded in black ink to cover a section of South-East Alabama, although it does not match anything produced by government forecasts of hurricanes. He spoke again to the journalists on September 4, Trump said he \"didn't know\" who changed the map. Trump also had this saying, referring to another model he thought would prove his point: \"I know Alabama was in the original forecast. They thought he was gonna get it as a piece of it. And you were supposed to go -- actually, we have a better map than that, which is going to be, where we had so many lines going directly -- so many models -- and each line is a model. And they were passing straight through. In all cases, Alabama was beaten - if not lightly - in some cases severely. Georgia, Alabama - It was a different route. They've given this a 95% chance.\" The forecasters didn't give Alabama a 95% chance of getting beaten, and the \"Better Map\" Trump shared hours later in tweeting also didn't show most models multiplying Alabama. The unsealed Trump tweet showed the August 28 example of spaghetti cutting off the course of the hurricane, which appeared in countless vibration lines directed towards the south-eastern United States. \"This was the originally expected course of the hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted that they would also pass Florida and hit Georgia and Alabama. I accept the apologies of the fake news!\" This was the originally expected course of the hurricane in its early stages.

Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 4 September 2019, spaghetti schemes show different models up to 10 days and require professional interpretation. These models are examined by the National Hurricane Centre, which then produces a five-day forecast. Judith Corrie, an atmospheric scientist and the Climate Prediction Network Foundation, said. \"But they are easily misunderstood by the public\" Apparently, the President. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, \"There was never a 95% chance that Alabama would be beaten, let alone \"very difficult\" or \"in all cases,\" said Brian McNoldy, a typhoon seeker at the University of Miami, who criticized Trump's statements about Hurricane Dorian and other subjects. The spaghetti map shows multiple computer models predicting the course of the storm up to 10 days. There are about 100 models from different sources, including government and private companies. Some meteorologists are only paying attention to some of them. The key is not to pull a certain thread, but to seek consensus and control the trend over time. While Tramp's graphic tweet showed some lines passing through Alabama, McNoldy said that the lines were \"not all equal and should not be interpreted as such.\" He said: \"Even so, there was only a small handful, almost a 95 per cent chance or, in all cases, an opportunity.\" The exact printer of the drawings says, \"If anything on these drawings causes confusion, ignore the entire product.\" As for the tramp map of the potential cone, this also seems to be an exaggeration in one of many five-day forecasts. One map of August 30 showed the outer edge of the cone for five days barely tearing apart the southeast corner of Alabama. Most of the time around that time the cone showed a centre above Florida and the coast of the South-East Atlantic. The edge of the cone represents the probability of two thirds of the storm's tracking center within it, using the average course error of the previous five years, said McNoldy. At the end of the week, there was growing consensus that Hurricane Dorian would turn north before eventually reaching Florida, as Carrie said. \"There was never a great chance of getting to Alabama,\" she said. There was a period of time when the Gulf was really threatened in the run-up to five days, and Keith J. Blackwell and Andrew Murray said, two meteorologists at the University of South Alabama. However, the five-day forecasts from the National Typhoon Center focused on Florida and then the south-east coast days before Trump began in Alabama. (Trap has since highlighted a warning from the Alabama National Guard on Twitter about the prediction of the storm. Meteorological scientists to whom we have reached have not shared our opinion.) The advice provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed that, at certain points, the wind is likely to be blown by tropical storms, and that Alabama faces strong winds in the next few days. For example, the 30 August update at 2 p.m. anywhere from 5 to 30 per cent showed that Alabama would be facing wind at a speed of 39 miles per hour. In the end, there was very little chance that Dorian would have reached Alabama, but Trump was too much to appreciate earlier predictions. \"Alabama was by no means a potential target, but there was a small opportunity that Dorian could have entered the Gulf of Mexico,\" said the atmospheric scientist of Colorado State University Phil Clotzbach. \"But I think the main point is that NOAA never discussed this scenario, because it was probably at least one week from when this guidance was available.\" Our judgment says Trump that originally \"the predictions of almost all models\" will strike Dorian Alabama. Linked to the map of spaghetti models that showed different models over the next 10 days. While some of those models showed that Dorian hit Alabama, Trump was too much of what he showed. The National Typhoon Center takes these forms and then comes up with a five-day forecast. It's ridiculous for him to use costumes to conclude that she almost showed that the storm would hit Alabama, which matches our definition of fire pants.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00196"}
