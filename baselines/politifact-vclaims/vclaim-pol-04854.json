And these were treaties that were executive treaties, not authorized by Congress,\" Johnson said.\nJohnson\u2019s claim itself isn\u2019t new. He made the claim on CNN\u2019s New Day\u00a0on May 31 and Donald Trump tweeted the same claim May 29. Trump has also made the United States\u2019 role protecting other countries a talking point this election, leaving open the possibility of disbanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization if other countries fail to contribute their fair share.\nWe wanted to look closer into Johnson\u2019s claim about the United States\u2019 current obligations to other nations. The statement warrants examination on multiple grounds:\n1. The number of countries involved through formal treaties;\n2. Whether Congress had a say in the treaties;\n3. Are these provisions actually used?\nWe reached out to the Johnson campaign but did not get a response back.\nUnited States treaties\nA paper published by Tufts University professor Michael Beckley in 2015, The Myth of Entangling Alliances, contains Johnson\u2019s 69-country figure. In his analysis, Beckley counts the Organization of American States, NATO and various other treaties as collective defense arrangements.\nWe found that other sources include fewer countries. The State Department only counts 54.\nWe analyzed all of the treaties Beckley cites and compared it to U.S. Department of State records.\nThe Charter of The Organization of American States created the OAS \u2014 an organization that aims for regional solidarity in the Americas \u2014 and was approved by the Senate in 1951. The OAS Charter treaty pledges the United States to support 33 countries through collective security provisions in Articles 28 and 29, according to Beckley.\nThose countries include \u2014 Antigua & Barbuda, Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Hait\u00ed, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Per\u00fa, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname, Trinidad & Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela.\nBeckley\u2019s analysis also includes 28 countries as part of NATO, which was created by the North Atlantic Treaty and approved by the Senate on July 21, 1949. Article V of the NAT provides for collective defense.\nIn that list, Beckley includes \u2014 Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, West Germany and Germany.\nThose two agreements count for 61 of the 69 countries Johnson cited. Both were approved by the Senate, but more on that later.\nNext, Beckley cites the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty of 1951, which was also approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952.\nThat makes countries 62 and 63.\nBeckley also includes Japan as country 64 through a bilateral U.S.-Japan treaty (approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952), South Korea (65) through a mutual defense treaty (approved by the Senate on January 26, 1954), and the Philippines (66) through a mutual defense treaty (approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952).\nHe also cites a bilateral defense agreement with Pakistan (67) on March 5, 1959. According to Dennis Kux in his book on U.S.-Pakistan relations, this was an \"executive agreement\" \u2014 a different type of treaty not sent to the Senate for approval. Pakistan has since accused the United States of not honoring the agreement, Kux wrote.\nIsrael (68) and Taiwan (69) are also on Beckley\u2019s list. He includes Israel because he claims the United States has a \"de facto\" agreement to defend it (not a formal treaty). The Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress in 1979, requires the United States to provide defense assistance to Taiwan.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding all of these up gets to the 69 figure Johnson used on Meet The Press. \nThe official Department of State website, however, has a different number of collective defense arrangements \u2014 only 54 countries. The State Department excludes West Germany, Pakistan, Israel and Taiwan from Beckley\u2019s list and also adds Thailand due to the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty \u2014 which created the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and was approved by the Senate on Feb. 1, 1955.\nThe main difference, however, is that the State Department does not include all the countries in the OAS Charter. Rather, it only includes members of the affiliated Inter-American Treaty of International Assistance (Rio Treaty), a collective defense treaty with fewer members than the OAS Charter.\nJulian Ku, Maurice A. Deane distinguished professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University, agreed with the State Department\u2019s assessment. Ku did note, however, that these determinations have not been actively discussed since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s.\n\"The OAS Charter is not what we would call a mutual defense treaty,\" he said. \"It is not a treaty obligation to defend every member of the OAS Charter.\"\nBeckley told PolitiFact he used all the OAS countries primarily for methodological reasons.\nThere\u2019s another wrinkle to this count. Some countries the State Department included as part of the Rio Treaty \u2014 Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela \u2014 have recently denounced the treaty. Cuba has also announced it will not be rejoining the OAS, making its status within the Rio Treaty unclear. Lastly, SEATO \u2014 containing Thailand \u2014 disbanded in 1977.\nAdd it all up and what do you get?\nIt\u2019s reasonable to say the United States has obligations to defend anywhere from around 48 countries to close to 70.\nDid Congress have a say?\nThe second part of Johnson\u2019s claim \u2014 that all were \"executive treaties\" without congressional approval \u2014 does not stand up to scrutiny. The Senate approved all of the pertinent treaties through its \"Advice and Consent\" procedure under Article II, section 2 of the Constitution (with the exception of the Pakistan 1959 agreement).\nMichael Ramsey, an international law professor at the University of San Diego, told PolitiFact that Johnson could be considered \"technically correct\" because the House of Representatives does not consider the issue. Nonetheless, Ramsey explained, Johnson\u2019s claim is misleading because nothing \"improper\" was done.\n\"The Constitution expressly provides that treaties are to be approved by two-thirds of the Senate (and not the House),\" he wrote. \"Thus there is nothing improper occurring here, and it is not the case that these agreements are being done on executive authority alone.\"\nBeckley told PolitiFact that many treaties require action consistent with each nation\u2019s constitution, such that Congress would still have a say before an actual intervention.\nRelevance\nJohnson\u2019s phrasing of \"defend their borders\" could be misleading as well, making it seem that the United States has a more general and ongoing policy than it does. Just how strong an \"obligation\" the United States has is also questionable, experts said.\nThe treaties in question only require other member states to get involved if one country is attacked, which is rare.\n\"Look at those countries. Very few are under threat of attack,\" wrote Douglas Gibler, a professor of political science at the University of Alabama, in an email.\nIn addition, Beckley noted that the treaties do not require the United States to take immediate action and that the treaties often do not specify what such action would look like. The Rio Treaty, for example, provides \"no State shall be required to use armed force without its consent.\"\n\"The OAS Charter doesn\u2019t say the U.S. has to go in guns blazing to defend its allies to the death everytime someone comes under attack,\" Beckley said. \"The language is super vague with a lot of loopholes in it, so when Johnson says that the U.S. has an ironclad obligation to protect the country that\u2019s more than a bit of a stretch.\"\nKu noted as well that neither the OAS Treaty or the Rio Treaty have been actively invoked since the 1960s.\nOur ruling\nGary Johnson claimed that the United States is obligated to \"defend the borders\" of 69 countries by treaties, and that Congress did not have a say in the matter.\nJohnson\u2019s reference to \"69 countries\" is in the ballpark. However, he fails to include in his statement the nuance regarding how much action the United States would actually be compelled to take under these treaties, according to experts. Johnson is also wrong to say that Congress had not considered any of these treaties, because the Senate considered all but one pursuant to its constitutional powers.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9fc80cb6-ce8d-4630-93a7-2af99cff41fa", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04854"}
