The article contains a text on a range of popular foodstuffs and drinks such as Pepsi, Duritos, Lyce, Fretus, Aunt Jimima and Gatorade. He says, \"If the sheep only know... that there's a flavor improvement company called Sinomyx that puts the cells of aborted embryos in their food and drinks.\" The article also contains a long title that appears to be taken entirely from the 2015 blog by Rich Sawyer, where Sawyer includes this extract from the story of the conservative writers: \"Kraft, Pepsico, Nesstle, works with Simonyx, a California-based company that uses embryo cells that have been aborted to test falsified chemicals. The transgenic human transgenic line is known as \"HEK-293\" and is used to see how human palate will interact with artificial flavors. Since most of the processed food today lacks flavor, companies like Simunex are hired to develop their own flavor. \"Weir, according to the Code, holds a PhD in education from the University of Southern California. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let's start by saying that there is no -- no craft, no pepsi, no other American food company that sells materials to the public that contain \"inhabited fetal cells.\" The Governor's post story is that Sawyer's blog and Facebook reference are no longer on site, but we have followed once again the controversial claim to the 2011 conflict involving Sinomex, the San Diego-based biotechnology company, and a life-support group called the Children of God for Life. According to an archival copy of a press release issued on 29 March 2011 by Children of God for Life, the group called for the boycott of food companies that had contracted with Sinomex. The organization referred to a report issued in April 2002 by researchers from Sinomex as evidence that the company was adding 293 human college cells to its research and development to improve flavor. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"inducing him to abide by the proven book of democratic play.\" The first source of the cells was a legal abortion in the Netherlands in the 1970s. The cell line is widely used in biological and medical research, particularly in cancer research. Genetic stem cell research has been used in cell biology for over 30 years. However, there is no company that manufactures food or other products for human consumption that contain human embryos that have been aborted. Sinomex used the HEK 293 cell line in his flavor research to act as taste receptors for the mouth, allowing the company to test hundreds of materials. But these cells are not in any of the actual food products that consumers may find in the market. CBS News wrote about this in 2011: \"For non-scientists, this may seem a little strange, but the truth is that HEK 293 cells are widely used in pharmaceutical research, and they are used in the use of the technology. The difference here is that Pepsi's work is one of the first times that cells (maybe) are used to make food or drinks. \" (It is important to note that any part of a human kidney cell is never part of the Snomex taste improvements or any finished food products.\" Gwen Rosenberg, Vice-President for Investor Relations and Corporate Communications of Sinomex, described the process to Miami New Times during the 2011 debate and said, \"In essence, the robotic taste system\": \"Rosenberg described rows of small square plastic dishes with hundreds of small sways in each dish. The protein is placed in every whim, then flavor. If protein interacts with flavour, the results are drawn. If the new flavor (of which the company has more than 800,000) is successful with protein testing, then the company conducts taste tests with adult humans (alive). \" The author of science and medicine Matthew Herper dismantled the process in an article on Forbes in 2012: \"This is a 35-year-old technology. It is widely used in cell biology. It is impossible to consume them or the cells will cause any health problems. \"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The kidney cells were forced to take parts of DNA using a technique invented in 1973 using calcium solution. The resulting cells don't act like human cells at all, but they're very easy to work with and they've become a workhorse in cellular biology. This is why they are used to develop medicines and vaccines. (This is the original paper on the creation of HEK cells.) No new fetal tissue has been used to keep cell transplantation going; using this cell line does not lead to a new abortion.\" Our Facebook article claims that many popular food companies are adding \"fenry cells taken in their food and drinks\" to improve flavor. The function mischaracterizes the use of fetal stem cell research by biotechnology companies such as Sinomex. HEK 293 cells, a cell line from an abortion embryo since the 1970s, have been widely used in cell biology research for more than 30 years in multiple fields, including food and pharmaceutical development. However, none of these cells exist in food products available to consumers. So, while there's a background story associated with this article, the claim itself is not very accurate to assess anything that isn't wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00030"}
