She says the current wage of $7.25 an hour, set in 2009, has lost much of its purchase power and can\u2019t support a family.\nRepublican challenger Nick Freitas opposes efforts to raise the wage, saying it would strap businesses already maimed by the coronavirus crisis, and force layoffs.\nWhile debating the issue on Oct. 20, the candidates gave sharply different descriptions of typical minimum wage earners.\u00a0\nFreitas said they are young, entry-level workers. \"If you\u2019re looking for a way to systematically insure greater income inequality, then doubling the cost of hiring someone who\u2019s young or has low-skill labor; that needs that first job to be able to rise up in the marketplace, that\u2019s the way to do it,\" he said.\nSpanberger dismissed his description. \"The majority of minimum wage workers are not young people entering the workforce,\" she said. \"They are mothers, predominantly single mothers and oftentimes women of color.\"\nWe wondered which description was more accurate, and decided we could get an answer by fact checking Spanberger\u2019s definitive statement. Freitas\u2019 statement has ambiguity, which makes it a bad candidate for the Truth-O-Meter. He suggests young people are a large portion of minimum wage earners, which requires interpretation. Spanberger says flat out that the majority are mothers - a measurable claim.\u00a0\n\u00a0We couldn\u2019t find evidence that supports Spanberger\u2019s statement, even after reviewing information her campaign sent us.\nDearth of data\nThere\u2019s not much statistical information available on the nation\u2019s minimum wage earners, largely because the wage varies from state to state.\u00a0\nIn 21 states - including Virginia - it\u2019s set at the federal minimum of $7.25. (Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam signed a bill in April that will gradually increase the wage to $15 an hour in 2026. The first step will occur on May 1, 2021. Freitas voted against the bill.)\nTwenty-nine states have set their rates higher than the federal minimum - all the way up to $13.50 in Washington. And some cities have set their minimum wage above their state\u2019s floor. The large differences make efforts to statistically characterize minimum wage earners across the nation \"thorny,\" according to David Cooper, a senior economic analyst at left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is, however, some data available on the minimum wage earners from the 21 states that allow the $7.25 federal floor, kept by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It estimates only 392,000 U.S. non-tip employees worked at the bottom wage in 2019 - a half percent of the nation\u2019s hourly workers.\nFreitas\u2019 suggestion that they\u2019re mainly young people trying to break into the workforce is pretty accurate. BLS estimates 59 percent of the federal minimum wage earners were aged 16 to 24. We don't know how many of these earners are working their first job; BLS doesn\u2019t track that.\u00a0\nConversely, the statistics undercut Spanberger\u2019s assertion that \"the majority of minimum wage workers are not young people entering the workforce.\"\nMinimum wage moms\nWe asked Spanberger\u2019s campaign where she got her information that most minimum wage earners are mothers, but did not get a specific answer.\u00a0\nAmong other things, the campaign sent the 2019 BLS statistics on federal minimum wage workers that we\u2019ve already discussed. The\u00a0data doesn\u2019t address the number who are mothers. Its closest information is that 68% of all federal minimum wage earners are women, and two-thirds of those women are between 16 and 24.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe campaign also sent us research from the Economic Policy Institute that undermines Spanberger\u2019s claim. EPI estimates 33.5 million people from all states would get raises if the federal minimum wage was lifted $15 in 2024. That includes 7.8 million moms - or 23% of the beneficiaries.\nEPI estimates that 4.1 million of the working moms would be single parents - or 12% of all beneficiaries.\n\nOur ruling\nSpanberger, in debate, said, \"The majority of minimum wage workers\" are mothers.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s not much data on bottom wage earners across the nation because the minimum wage varies in most states. The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps limited statistics about minimum wage workers in the 21 states that allow the federal floor or $7.25 an hour, but it does not track the number or percentage who are moms.\nWe were unable to find data on the number of minimum wage moms, and Spanberger didn\u2019t come up with any. Some of the backup information her campaign actually cast doubt on her claim.\nSpanberger fails in her burden to prove her claim, so we rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18819"}
