Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. -- who is in a tough reelection contest against West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey -- tweeted, \"It\u2019s really a shame that Pat doesn\u2019t have the guts to answer questions about his lawsuit to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, his career as a Washington lobbyist for the opioid industry, or his efforts to put educators in jail.\"\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a shame that Pat doesn\u2019t have the guts to answer questions about his lawsuit to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, his career as a Washington lobbyist for the opioid industry, or his efforts to put educators in jail.\u201d https://t.co/R94dTXNJvY\u2014 Joe Manchin (@JoeManchinWV) September 14, 2018\n\n\nWe\u2019ve already looked at the question of pre-existing conditions and his lobbying history, so we decided to look at the question about the teachers\u2019 strike.\nPolitiFact previously concluded that Morrisey was on solid legal ground when he said the teacher strike was unlawful. But did he make efforts to put teachers behind bars, as Manchin charged?\nLet\u2019s take a closer look. (Manchin\u2019s office did not respond to inquiries.)\nThe strike\nTeachers in West Virginia went on a nine-day strike on Feb. 23, 2018, after Republican Gov. Jim Justice signed a bill giving teachers and other state employees a 1 percent to 2 percent pay raise, an amount they deemed insufficient. The striking teachers teachers sought higher salaries and relief from rising health care costs.\nThe strike involved 34,000 workers and touched all 55 counties; it was considered one of the nation's biggest strikes in recent years, according to Tthe New York Times. It ended when Justice signed a bill giving teachers a 5 percent raise.\nMorrisey\u2019s stance\nFrom the start, Morrisey asserted that the strike was unlawful.\nOn Feb. 21, 2018, he tweeted, \"The impending work stoppage is unlawful and should come to an end.\"\nAs we\u2019ve previously reported, there was precedent for this. During a 1990 teacher strike, the West Virginia Supreme Court found that the stoppage was unlawful because \"public employees provide essential public services which, if interrupted by strikes, would threaten the public welfare.\" A preliminary injunction was issued by Jefferson County Court in 1990, ending the strike.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetroNews reported that Morrissey was ready to take legal action against striking teachers if he was asked to do so under the law.\n\"Let us make no mistake,\" Morrisey told MetroNews on Feb. 21. \"The impending work stoppage is unlawful. State law and court rulings give specific parties avenues to remedy such illegal conduct, including the option to seek an injunction to end an unlawful strike.\"\n\"Unlawful\" doesn\u2019t mean \"criminal\"\nHowever, Morrisey\u2019s words were more precise -- and accurate -- than Manchin\u2019s. Morrisey said the strikes would be unlawful -- but that doesn\u2019t mean they would lead to \"jail\" for striking teachers.\n\"The teachers may have been subject to an injunction to go back to work, but they could not have been prosecuted for going out on strike,\" said West Virginia University law professor Bob Bastress.\nIn a news release at the time, Morrisey talked about the possibility of seeking an injunction -- but not jail. \"State law and court rulings give specific parties avenues to remedy such illegal conduct, including the option to seek an injunction to end an unlawful strike,\" he wrote.\nWhen we reached out to Morrisey\u2019s campaign, a spokesman said that Morrisey never suggested locking up teachers. \"You can go through his statements from the time, and you won't find anything that suggests what Manchin is claiming,\" the campaign said in a statement.\nWhen asked about what Morrisey meant when hold MetroNews he was willing to take \"legal action\" against teachers, the Morrisey campaign cited an opinion letter by the then-Attorney General, Democrat Roger Tompkins, in 1990.\nTompkins wrote that teachers who went on strike in 1990 could be \"disqualified from teaching in a public school for one year, and the state department of education and county board of education may withhold all papers and credentials of such teacher.\"\nThese are serious consequences -- but well short of jail.\n\"Morrisey has civil legal authority, which does not include criminal authority,\" the campaign said. \"That authority is left to the governor and the criminal justice system.\"\nOur ruling\nManchin tweeted that Morrisey made \"efforts to put educators in jail.\"\nMorrisey, in his capacity as attorney general, said the strike was unlawful -- but that meant that striking teachers could have been punished by disciplinary actions, not criminal charges that could land them in jail. While the disciplinary actions could have had severe consequences in some cases, Manchin\u2019s suggestion that \"jail\" could have resulted is a significant exaggeration.\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-10-11 22:36:59 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Patrick Morrisey undertook \"efforts to put educators in jail.\"    Joe Manchin U.S. Senate, D-W.Va. https://twitter.com/JoeManchinWV/status/1040633939067592709   a tweet Friday, September 14, 2018 2018-09-14    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01487"}
