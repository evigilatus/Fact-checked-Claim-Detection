Is\u00a0Gaetz\u00a0correctly characterizing the past?\n\nFirst, a refresher: The sweeping elections overhaul pushed by Republicans included a number of new restrictions on voter registration, political committees, the date of the presidential preference primary and, yeah, early voting.\n\nBefore\u00a0Gov. Rick Scott signed\u00a0HB\u00a01355\u00a0into law,\u00a0early voting\u00a0started\u00a015\u00a0days ahead of an election and ended two days prior. Supervisors were required to provide voters with eight hours of early voting on weekdays sometime between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., as well as a total of eight hours during each of the two weekends. Voting on the Sunday before an election was popular among African-Americans who hosted \"souls to the polls\" drives.\n\nAll told, supervisors had to provide 96 hours for early voting.\n\nThe new law reduced the number of days for early voting from 14 to eight. Republicans said they thought the changes would save money, but Democrats accused them of trying to suppress the vote of liberal and minority voters, who prefer early voting. The new law also meant an end to the \"souls to the polls\" rallies on the Sunday before the election.\n\nThe new law came with new restrictions for voting hours, too. Instead of eight hours of early voting per weekday, the law called for a\u00a0minimum\u00a0of six hours a day and a maximum of 12 hours a day.\n\n* * *\nNow we\u2019ll examine what\u00a0Gaetz\u00a0had to do with it.\n\nGaetz\u00a0spokeswoman Katherine\u00a0Betta\u00a0directed us to\u00a0this\u00a0amendment\u00a0introduced\u00a0by\u00a0Gaetz\u00a0and the sponsor of the proposed elections overhaul, Sen. Miguel Diaz de la\u00a0Portilla, R-Miami, on May 5, 2011.\n\nThe amendment did three main things:\u00a0It required\u00a0local election supervisors to tell the Department of State 30 days in advance the hours and address of each early voting site; it reduced the number of days for early voting, as we have already explained; and it set the daily number of hours for early voting between six and 12 hours. The latter action is key to our fact-check.\n\nGaetz\u00a0said he introduced the amendment to give more consideration to teachers and military members who populate his former Panhandle district and may have unusual working hours. Voting days of 12 hours would mean voting would be available outside of the traditional 9-to-5 workday.\n\nSenate Republicans said they thought reducing early voting days would save money, but a few elections supervisors warned that 12-hour days might actually lead to higher overtime costs. According to news accounts,\u00a0Gaetz\u00a0said Republicans did not want to \"dramatically reduce early voting.\"\n\nAt one point during the legislative\u00a0process, the number of early voting days was reduced all the way down to five. Republicans fended off Democratic attempts to restore the number of early voting days back to 14.\u00a0Gaetz\u2019s\u00a0amendment, which offered eight early voting days, was\u00a0adopted\u00a0by\u00a0the Senate and included in the\u00a0final version of the\u00a0bill\u00a0that\u00a0Scott signed.\n\n* * *\n\nNow we will address the claim that\u00a0Gaetz\u00a0offered the amendment as a compromise and threatened to join Democrats against the measure without it.\n\nWe checked with the Senate\u2019s former minority leader, Nan Rich, D-Weston, who said she had not heard about that.\n\n\"I never recalled him saying he was going to stand with the Democrats,\" she said. \"All I know is how he voted.\"\n\nWe looked for comments Gaetz may have made on the Senate floor but didn't find any. In an interview,\u00a0Gaetz\u00a0said he did not remember exactly when and where he said he would side with the Democrats without the amendment. He ruled out saying it on the Senate floor or to members of the opposing party, though.\n\n\"I may have said it in committee, I said it to my staff and I said it to the president,\"\u00a0Gaetz\u00a0said, referring to his Senate president predecessor, Mike\u00a0Haridopolos.\n\nSome Republican leaders in the Senate wanted to cut the number of early voting days to eight without expanding hours to make up for lost time, said Diaz de la\u00a0Portilla\u00a0in an interview with us. He said he never witnessed\u00a0Gaetz\u00a0saying he would cross party lines over the early voting amendment, but \"I know there were conversations.\"\n\nPolitiFact\u00a0Florida has previously\u00a0disproved\u00a0the\u00a0claim that the number of hours are the same. Under the new law, local supervisors may do a\u00a0maximum of\u00a096 hours. But they may also offer fewer than that.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaetz\u00a0declined to tell us what kind of changes, if any, he wants to consider in the upcoming legislative session, though he said he could see allowing for more early voting locations. He wants to wait for the findings of a special committee on ethics and elections headed by Sen. Jack\u00a0Latvala, R-Clearwater, before calling for across-the-board changes for every county, he said.\n\n\"My attitude is that as we speak, Sen. (Jack)\u00a0Latvala\u00a0is conducting a hearing with election supervisors to try to find out what were the reasons that there were difficulties in some places,\"\u00a0Gaetz\u00a0told\u00a0PolitiFact\u00a0Florida.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBack to our mission:\u00a0Gaetz\u2019s\u00a0editorial board comments that he sponsored the amendment that expanded hours for early voting and threatened to join Democrats in opposition if leaders did not agree to it.\n\nWe cannot prove or disprove his claim that he threatened to side with Democrats. For this reason, we\u2019re not rating this part of his statement.\n\nGaetz did introduced the amendment that permitted more hours for early voting. But his amendment empowered supervisors to provide up to 12 hours of early voting a day. It was not an automatic expansion, and supervisors could actually choose to offer less time than the old law.\n\nWe rate his claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09847"}
