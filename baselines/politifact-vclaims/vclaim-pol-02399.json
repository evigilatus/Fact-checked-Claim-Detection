And his proposed budget included cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as education programs.\nTrump\u2019s moves have sparked outcry among Democrats, who have argued that the cuts will make government less effective and endanger the environment. In North Carolina, state Rep. Bobbie Richardson recently took to Twitter to raise alarm about Trump\u2019s latest budget proposal and how it affects the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nRichardson, a three-term representative from Louisburg, is the Democratic whip in the state House.\n\"The president is cutting the CDC budget by 80%. Is this recklessness or deliberate action against preventive healthcare?\" Richardson tweeted on Feb. 3. She has about 1,000 followers.\nPolitiFact found this tweet questionable. The CDC is the nation\u2019s primary source for developing and applying disease prevention methods and health education activities. Cutting the CDC budget by 80 percent would have a drastic impact on its ability to study America\u2019s ability to help prevent illness across the country.\nWhat the CDC said\nFinding the truth seemed as simple as asking CDC officials about their budget. So we reached out to them. Bernadette Burden, a senior press officer for the CDC, responded Wednesday.\nShe said the CDC\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019, which starts in July, is $5.66 billion. That\u2019s a decrease of approximately $1.4 billion \u2013 or 20 percent \u2013 compared to the spending level, Burden said in an email.\nA breakdown of spending in the current fiscal year is available on the CDC website. The CDC provided a fact sheet of Trump\u2019s budget, which outlines where he aims to cut.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other changes, Trump\u2019s budget would cut $138 million from the program dedicated to chronic disease prevention and health promotion, cut $59.9 million from programs studying \"emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases,\" and $46 million from a program called \"Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health.\" A zoonotic disease is a disease that can be transmitted from animals to people.\nBurden noted that the CDC adapted its budget request to includes program reductions and eliminations that Trump proposed last year.\nMisreading headlines?\nPolitiFact couldn\u2019t find any news articles that verified Richardson\u2019s claim. It\u2019s possible that Richardson misquoted the headline from this Washington Post story: \"CDC to cut by 80 percent efforts to prevent global disease outbreak.\"\nThe story says the CDC is downsizing one of its specific efforts \u2013 its epidemic prevention activities \u2013 because money is running out. The epidemic prevention programs \"train front-line workers in outbreak detection and work to strengthen laboratory and emergency response systems in countries where disease risks are greatest,\" the Post reported. The CDC is cutting its efforts in 39 out of 49 countries.\nIt\u2019s unclear if Richardson misread the Washington Post headline. Nonetheless, PolitiFact believes this opportunity is as good as any to remind folks to read stories before making judgements about news based on headlines.\nAs for Richardson, her assistant, Anna Meadows, confirmed that neither she nor Richardson could find the original source for the tweet.\n\"She deleted the post after your inquiry, since she couldn\u2019t find the source,\" Meadows said in an email.\nOur ruling\nRichardson tweeted that President Trump is \"cutting the CDC budget by 80 percent.\" The proposal is a 20 percent cut \u2013 which is not remotely close to Richardson\u2019s claim. She deleted the tweet. So we rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-16 17:40:46 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \u201cThe president is cutting the CDC budget by 80%.\u201d    Bobbie Richardson N.C. state Rep. twitter   North Carolina Saturday, February 3, 2018 2018-02-03    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02399"}
