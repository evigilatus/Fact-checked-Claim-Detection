The post features a black-and-white image of Kennedy in a shirt and tie. Kennedy appears to be exhaling smoke while holding perhaps a cigar of some sort. Text below the image claims:\n\"JFK SMOKED CANNABIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHILE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE HE SUFFERED FROM SEVERE BACK PAIN & ADDISON'S DISEASE.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nKennedy suffered from a number of serious ailments, including chronic back pain and Addison\u2019s disease (which causes extreme fatigue and other symptoms). He was known for trying to keep them secret. He served less than three years as president before being assassinated in Dallas in 1963.\nThere\u2019s no proof he smoked marijuana to treat his ailments. We asked historians and consulted the history books.\nA 1998 book on Mary Meyer, one of Kennedy\u2019s mistresses, recounted a 1976 National Enquirer story that said Meyer and Kennedy smoked marijuana once at the White House. The information in the article was attributed to the late Jim Pruitt, who by then was a former Washington Post editor, who said Meyer told him about the encounter.\nThe Washington Post reported on the Enquirer article at the time. According to the Post, Pruitt confirmed his account about the marijuana smoking, said he had given the marijuana to Meyer, and he said the Enquirer had paid him for the story.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut none of that goes to the idea that Kennedy regularly used marijuana at the White House in order to fight his ailments.\nStacey Flores Chandler, a reference archivist at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, told us the foundation has Kennedy\u2019s medical records from the 1950s and \u201860s as well as records of several of Kennedy's physicians.\u00a0\n\"I haven't found any evidence in either the records here or in secondary sources that the president used cannabis as a treatment for any of his medical conditions,\" she told us.\nChandler also noted that historian Robert Dallek, who had access to Kennedy\u2019s medical records, wrote about amphetamines, steroids, painkillers and other medications prescribed for Kennedy\u2019s back and Addison\u2019s, but made no mention of marijuana.\u00a0\nWe messaged Chong\u2019s website but didn\u2019t get a reply.\nOur ruling\nA social media post claims Kennedy \"smoked cannabis in the White House, while president, because he suffered from severe back pain and Addison's disease.\"\nThere is an unconfirmed, secondhand account that Kennedy once smoked marijuana at the White House. And he did suffer back pain and Addison\u2019s, according to records.\nBut there is no evidence to support the suggestion that Kennedy regularly smoked marijuana in the White House because of his physical ailments.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17361"}
