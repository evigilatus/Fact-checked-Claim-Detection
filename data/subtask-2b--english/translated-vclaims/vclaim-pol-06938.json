Ariane-Murley made a statement in which she highlighted that Afro-American and Hispanic men were being arrested at disproportionate rates under current drug laws. We wondered whether Ariane Morelli had correctly obtained his numbers, so we asked him on what basis his statement was based. We have also contacted the Justice Statistics Office of the Ministry of Justice and the National Non-Profit Advocacy Group, the sentencing project, for current figures. We contacted the U.S. Census Bureau and the historic Rhode Island Society for data on slavery in 1850. The 1850 census showed that 872,924 African-American slaves over 15 years of age were living in the United States at the time. (The same census found that there were a total of 3.2 million African-American slaves of all ages, at a time when the total population of the United States, including slaves and \"free colours,\" was 23.2 million. How can this be compared to the number of African-American men who are now subject to some kind of oversight of the judicial system? According to the Federal Office of Justice Statistics, 526,000 African-American men were spending time in state or federal correctional facilities in 2013. (This is 37 percent of a total of 1.5 million imprisoned men). This represents approximately 3 per cent of all black males in the United States, compared to 5 per cent of white males, according to the Bureau. There were 877,000 African-American men under surveillance in 2013, according to the Bureau. There were 280,000 African-American men. \u2022 Control is part of a criminal sentence that allows the perpetrator to remain under surveillance in the community rather than in prison. Conditional release is the supervised release of a prisoner from prison prior to his official release.) In total, there were approximately 1.68 million African-American men under State supervision and federal criminal justice in 2013, more than 807,076 African-American men being enslaved in 1850. On 29 January 2021, Mark Maur, Executive Director of the sentencing project, gave a somewhat higher estimate of the number of African-American men currently imprisoned or under surveillance and conditional release. His figure, which includes those who spend time in local prisons, was about 1.88 million people, more than 1 million over 1850. From a Rhode Island perspective, we asked the State Department of Corrections to get their numbers. On 10 October, 932 African-American men were sentenced or awaiting trial in Rhode Island out of 3,108 male prisoners in general. In addition, 4,285 African-American men were on probation; 87 were on parole; and 4 were on probation for life, according to Susan Lamkins. This total amounts to 5,308 or 11 per cent of 48,542 black or African-American men in Rhode Island aged 18 years or over, according to census estimates of 1 July 2013. When Ariane Morelli returned to us, he referred us to the book \"The Coloured Blind Group Prison\" by Michel Alexander, and to an interview with Alexander that appeared on Huffington Post. The Huffington Post story attributed Alexander to a statement that black men were behind bars or under criminal justice surveillance more than they were enslaved in 1850. \"There are African-American men in prison or prison, under surveillance or parole, more than they were enslaved in 1850.\" Our research showed that the United States Bureau of Criminal Statistics placed the number of African-American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013 at around 1.68 million - 807,076 higher than the number of African-American men in 1850. The sentencing project also places this figure at 1.88 million, taking into account local prisons. In the light of this evidence, we assess Arin-Murley &apos; s claim correctly.
