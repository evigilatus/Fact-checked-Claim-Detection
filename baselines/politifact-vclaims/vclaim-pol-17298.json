The Dec. 16 post says that Trump is the winner of the 2020 election and that he and his administration \"look forward to the January 20th Inauguration of their continuation of power and Second Term! This celebration of our president will take place at the President\u2019s residence at Mar-A-Lago, or the winter White House.\"\nThe post also states that \"any attempt to remove the Trump administration will require force.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe Facebook post is fake, a Trump campaign spokesman confirmed. We looked at the events tab on the Trump campaign website, and it makes no mention of a Jan. 20 event \u2014 the only events are appearances by Vice President Mike Pence in Georgia. Stepien\u2019s Twitter account showed his last tweet was Nov. 5.\nTrump never officially conceded the election, but told reporters on Thanksgiving\u00a0 that he would leave the White House if the Electoral College chose Biden, even as he pressed his baseless claims of election fraud.\n\"Certainly I will, and you know that,\" he said. \"But I think that there will be a lot of things happening between now and the 20th of January, a lot of things. Massive fraud has been found.\"\nMassive fraud has not been found, according to officials in Trump\u2019s own administration, and the Electoral College did vote for Biden. Judges nationwide have tossed out dozens of Trump lawsuits\u00a0 challenging the results of the Nov. 3 election.\nTrump hasn\u2019t announced plans for Jan. 20\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Trump will attend Biden\u2019s inauguration. News reports based on anonymous sources said Trump is considering holding a campaign event for himself Jan. 20.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House spokesperson Judd Deere told PolitiFact: \"Anonymous sources who claim to know what the President is or is not considering have no idea.

(AP)\nTraditionally, the departing president hosts the president-elect at the White House, and then attends his successor\u2019s inauguration, as a symbol of the peaceful transfer of power.\nTrump plans to move to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Fla., following his presidency, but those plans are being challenged. The Washington Post reported that a lawyer for neighbors wrote to Palm Beach officials asserting that Trump can\u2019t live there under the terms of his 1993 agreement with the town. Mar-a-Lago club members can\u2019t spend more than 21 days in the guest suites or more than seven consecutive days in a year. The Post said Trump spent at least 130 days at Mar-a-Lago during his presidency. It\u2019s unclear if town officials will take any action.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post purporting to be from the Trump campaign said Trump will hold his inauguration for a second term at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe Trump campaign confirmed the post is a fake. Trump lost his bid for a second term and plans to move to Mar-a-Lago after\u00a0his presidency ends. Het has not announced what he will do during Biden\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration.\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire.\nRELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17298"}
