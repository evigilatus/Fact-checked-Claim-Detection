It could also raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent.\"\n\nWe\u2019re aware there\u2019s general agreement that cap-and-trade legislation carries a cost for most -- if not all -- consumers.\n\nBut the numbers Johnson cites on gas and electric costs are eye-popping.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look.\n\nHow cap and trade works\n\nGenerally speaking, cap and trade works like this: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits \u2014 also known as allowances \u2014 to continue polluting.\n\nCompanies that find ways to reduce pollution easily and cheaply can end up with extra credits, and sell them to other companies that have trouble reducing their emissions or want to make longer-term investments in conservation, according to a summary by the Environmental Defense Fund. While companies may exchange allowances, the overall limit on pollution remains in place.\n\nThe cap would then be reduced over time to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions. A lower cap aims to make it more costly for utilities and industries to continue burning fossil fuels.\n\nWhen we asked Johnson for backup, a spokesman in his office said the constituent response refers to a 2008 study commissioned by groups concerned about a cap-and-trade bill introduced in the Senate.\n\nThe study does have numbers very close to what Johnson cited -- 141 and 177 percent increases, for gas and oil, solely because of the bill. The study broke out price effects for each state, as well as a national figure.\n\nBut several things jumped out at us about the study.\n\nIn predicting price effects over nearly 25 years, the study presents a range of low and high price-hike estimates, not single figures. The low-cost estimate for gasoline is 72 percent, half of the worst-case estimate. For electricity, the low end increase was 126 percent.\n\nJohnson mentions only the worst-case scenario, though he did frame it as prices \"could\" jump by the higher figures.\n\nThe study was commissioned by two groups that have opposed legislative efforts on climate change on the same economic grounds that Johnson cites. They are the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).\n\nIt is relatively recent, 2008, but it focused on a bill -- the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act (S. 2191) -- first introduced in 2007. It was replaced by a companion bill in 2008, which died in the Senate. Neither got as much traction as a 2009 bill that passed the House.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we broadened our search, we found numerous impact studies by public and private entities on cap-and-trade legislation, and specifically on Lieberman-Warner.\n\nAccording to experts, all such efforts at forecasting energy price increases are iffy due to the complexity level.\n\nThe cost projections on Lieberman-Warner are \"at best speculative\" and should be viewed skeptically, warned an exhaustive Congressional Research Service review of six studies. \"It is difficult to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled.\"\n\nFuel price estimates, in particular, vary widely depending on various assumptions made by researchers, the review said.\n\nAnd the study for the manufacturing group -- cited by Johnson -- showed dramatically higher increases in gasoline prices than predicted in studies by two government agencies and a non-profit that supports cap and trade, the research service found.\n\nGasoline: The Johnson-cited study projected hikes of $1.70 to $3.25 per gallon by 2030, while the federal government\u2019s official source of energy statistics, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), predicted increases of 40 cents per gallon. The non-profit Clean Air Task Force put the hike at 25 cents. The figures compared are national, not specific to Wisconsin.\n\nElectricity: The Johnson-cited study predicted increases at least twice as high as studies by EIA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Task Force, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Mining Association. Again, the figures are national.\n\nThe CRS specifically warned about breaking down cost impacts state by state -- as the manufacturers study did -- saying: \"Simple attempts by some presentations to break down the cost by industrial sector or by state should be viewed with attentive skepticism.\"\n\nOverall, the service found, \"the more comprehensive analyses are the work by EPA, EIA, and MIT.\"\n\nAnother bill, another study\n\nThe two groups behind the study Johnson relied on also did a separate projection of the Wisconsin energy cost impact of a more recent bill -- the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 sponsored by U.S. Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey.\n\nThe Waxman-Markey bill, unlike Lieberman-Warner, \u00a0passed the House 219-212 on June 26, 2009. It did not get a Senate vote. Its impact was studied in 2009.\n\nIn that study, the two groups projected much smaller price increases from Waxman-Markey (19.9 percent to 26.1 percent for gas, and 37.5 percent to 59.7 percent for electric)than from the bill Johnson chose to highlight (increases well over 100 percent).\n\nThat\u2019s likely because Waxman-Markey rolled some of the revenue from pollution permits back to consumers in the form of rebates or expanded efficiency programs.\n\nJohnson spokesman Brian Faughnan told us Johnson\u2019s climate change letter was simply an attempt to show the reasonable possible impact of major legislation that started in the Senate, the chamber where he serves.\n\n\"Senator Johnson\u2019s letter does not claim to give a full range of the estimates of the impact of cap and trade,\" Faughnan wrote in an email to us.\n\nAnd in any event, the two studies by the manufacturers show major increases in gas prices, and significantly greater electricity costs, Faughnan wrote.\n\nOur rating\n\nExperts agree that cap and trade likely means higher energy costs for consumers.\n\nJohnson goes further, saying it would be \"prohibitively expensive.\" He tells constituents he opposes it in part because a \"recent study\" showed it could \"raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent.\"\n\nThere is a study that includes those estimates for Wisconsin.\n\nBut Johnson ignores critical facts. The same study cites much smaller increases under a second scenario. And its conclusions, published by opponents of the bill, are an outlier among several other studies that independent congressional researchers say were more thorough -- and show much smaller increases. He also ignores studies that said a more recent bill dramatically held down the size of cost increases to consumers.\n\nIn an area in which precise conclusions are difficult, Johnson cherry-picks one study of a dead bill and presents its worst-case scenario as hard evidence of \"prohibitively expensive\" effects of a cap and trade approach.\n\nWe rate his statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09410"}
