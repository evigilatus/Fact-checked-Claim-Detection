Trump said: \"President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to over $19 trillion, growing.\" \"So what should we show him? Our roads and bridges are collapsing in the case of third-world airports and 43 million Americans on food stamps. We wanted to check his statistics on Americans using the supplementary food assistance programme, or SNAP, the programme formerly known as food stamps. The programme &apos; s benefits provide grocery vouchers to qualified low-income Americans. The United States Department of Agriculture, which oversees the programme, counted some 43.6 million people in the programme in April 2016, the latest available data. So Trump is at a point, in terms of numbers. But there's a better story. Although the number of people carrying food stamps is large, it is an improvement. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2021, when Obama took office in January 2009, approximately 32 million people received SNAP benefits. This number increased during the major recession as more families moved to the assistance programme, with an average of 47.6 million participants per year in 2013. A report by the Food Research and Action Centre, a hunger and nutrition advocacy group, paid tribute to the 43 million people in April as the lowest level of participants since October 2010. From April 2015 to April 2016, the number of participants decreased to 1.9 million. We explained in an earlier fact study that it was unclear whether the SNAP records would be as high under a Republican president, as the economy would weaken before Obama took office. The number of beneficiaries is already increasing under President George W. Bush, whose administration expanded eligibility criteria and tried to get more Americans to apply for assistance from the South Pacific National Action Programme. The Republican Policy Programme approved by the Republican National Council recommends that the SNAP programme be broken away from the United States Department of Agriculture and the Farming Bill, under which funding for the programme is usually negotiated in Congress. As a separate entity, the South Pacific National Action Programme will be more vulnerable to budget cuts. The Governor Trump said: \"Forty-three million Americans on food stamps.\" The number of participants in the South Pacific National Action Programme has declined in recent years in the midst of economic recovery, but Trump reads the latest. We're assessing Trump's claim correctly. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6e08da4b-58b2-458b-8403-14758e05183c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04637"}
