Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, suggested that Democrats had the moral high ground.\nEven though some Democrats had thought that President George W. Bush had abused his authority when he initiated the Iraq War, the House, while under Democratic control in 2007 and 2008, did not impeach him.\nThe current resolution to authorize a lawsuit, Jackson Lee said in a floor speech on July 30, 2014, \"smacks against the Constitution, which says there are three equal branches of government. Therefore, the executive has the right to perform his duties. I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution for it is, in fact, a veiled attempt for impeachment, and it undermines the law that allows the president to do his job. It is a historical fact that President Bush pushed this nation into a war that had little to do with apprehending terrorists. We did not seek an impeachment of President Bush because as an executive, he had his authority. President Obama has the authority.\"\nA reader asked us to check whether it\u2019s accurate for Jackson Lee to say, \"We did not seek an impeachment of President Bush.\" So we took a closer look.\nJackson Lee, it turns out, is an imperfect vehicle for making this charge. Here\u2019s the problem: A dozen House Democrats in 2008 did introduce a resolution seeking the impeachment of Bush. And Jackson Lee was one of the measure\u2019s 11 co-sponsors.\nThe measure in question was H. Res. 1258, introduced by then-Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, on June 10, 2008. The resolution -- a 167-page laundry list of criticisms -- accused Bush of \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" citing numerous \"abuses of power\" related to his prosecution of the war in Iraq and the fight against global terrorism, among other topics.\nIf Jackson Lee means to define \"we\" as the Democratic caucus as a whole, she has a point. The resolution never gained wide support among the Democrats, even though they controlled Congress at the time. The bill died quietly in committee.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPelosi explained her thinking about the impeachment resolution in a July 2008 interview on ABC's The View. \"I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country,\" she said. \"We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes.\"\nEven so, it seems odd to hear Jackson Lee saying \"we did not seek\" impeachment when she, in fact, was a co-sponsor of a measure that sought precisely that.\nWhen we reached out to Jackson Lee\u2019s office, communications director Michael J. McQuerry said, \"the Congresswoman was stating that the Democrats did not try to impeach President Bush over executive orders.\"\nHowever, we looked through Jackson Lee\u2019s floor speech and saw no references to executive orders. For that matter, the specific target of the House GOP\u2019s lawsuit -- administrative changes to delay the effective date of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate -- did not take the form of an executive order, either, although Republicans have been critical of some of Obama\u2019s executive orders more generally.\nFurther undercutting Jackson Lee\u2019s explanation, the 2008 impeachment resolution she co-sponsored did address executive orders twice:\n\u2022 It quoted then-Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., saying the Bush administration's \"shroud of secrecy extends to agency rules and executive pronouncements, such as executive orders, that carry the force of law. Through the diligent efforts of my colleague, Sen. (Sheldon) Whitehouse (D-R.I), we have learned that (the Office of Legal Counsel) has taken the position that a president can \u2018waive\u2019 or \u2018modify\u2019 a published executive order without any notice to the public or Congress -- simply by not following it.'\"\n\u2022 Citing a 2007 article from the Washington Post, the resolution said that Mike McConnell, Bush\u2019s director of national intelligence, in a letter to the late Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, \"acknowledged that Bush's executive order in 2001 authorized a series of secret surveillance activities and included undisclosed activities beyond the warrantless surveillance of emails and phone calls that Bush confirmed in December 2005.\"\nOur ruling\nJackson Lee said, \"We did not seek an impeachment of President Bush.\" She has a point that neither the House nor a majority of the Democratic caucus sought Bush\u2019s impeachment. However, a dozen Democratic lawmakers did -- including Jackson Lee herself. It seems hypocritical of the congresswoman to seize the moral high ground -- essentially saying that her party gallantly went against self-interest by declining to seek Bush\u2019s impeachment -- when in fact she personally had sought precisely that outcome.
