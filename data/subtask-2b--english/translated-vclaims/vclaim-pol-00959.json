Sanders started by saying why it was important to get rid of Trump. \"Not only did we have a president who wanted to throw 32 million people out of the health care they had, having promised that he would provide health care for all,\" said Autonomous Vermont in February 25. \"This President is the first President in the modern history of our country to attempt to divide our people, based on the colour of their skin, the country in which they were born, their sexual orientation, their sex, their religion.\" In this fact check, we examine whether Trump wants 32 million people to lose their health care. Trump spoke of his health-care objectives in broad terms, sometimes even contradicting himself. Ultimately, however, the provision is due to legislative and executive procedures. Sanders based his number on the ongoing attempts of Tramp to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We will put Sanders' claim in context. At the presidential primary stage of the Republic, Trump provided two pillars for his health care plan. \"We'll get rid of Obama's care,\" he said on March 5, 2016. \"It's a complete disaster being replaced. And we'll have big health care at some cost.\" In general, Trump spoke of increased competition and the use of the private market to provide better insurance. He also said that his goal was to meet the needs of the poorest. \"There's going to a group of people at the bottom, people who didn't do well,\" he said on 18 February 2016. \"We'll take care of them through, perhaps, medical care concepts.\" :: Medical care is primarily for older persons, while medical assistance is for the poor, so the meaning of Trump is unclear. After the elections, with Republicans taking control of the White House and Congress, the legislative process began. ................................................................................................ The first victory came when the house approved the American Health Care Act. The Republicans met Trump at the White House to celebrate. Trump said, \"What we have is a very, very, very elaborate thing.\" \"This is a great plan,\" said Trump, May 4, 2017. \"I actually think they'll get better than that. And that's, don't make a mistake, that's a cancellation and replacement for Obamakari.\" The Budget Office of Congress estimated that the House Bill would reduce the number of persons otherwise secured by 23 million by 2026. Trump later called the House of Representatives Bill \"Medium\" and he hoped the Senate version would add more money. The Senate has struggled to enact health-care legislation. Trump put pressure on the Republicans to unite around a bill. On July 24, 2017, the White House meeting with senators, the Senate version said, \"You will provide truly great health care.\" The Congressional Budget Office estimated that under the Senate Bill, 15 million people would lose insurance after one year and 22 million by 2026. Late at night, the dramatic vote under the thumb of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, failed the procedure. Trump often expressed regret at that moment. On January 13, 2021, General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines in security, and said, \"We're not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, he said, \"We got health care, and it was done,\" in a radio interview on October 17, 2017. \"Then I raised a hand and then the hand -- I went up the wrong direction at 2:00 in the morning, and everyone was shocked and disappointed.\" Another proposal is under way in the Senate. It could have eliminated large portions of the Obama care programme, including the requirement for insurance, the expansion of medical support and premium subsidies, but would not have replaced those programmes with any new ones. Trump expressed support for this kind of difficult approach. \"If the members of the Republican Senate cannot pass what they are now working on, they should immediately repEAL, and then re-publish the law later,\" grocery on June 30, 2017. If the Republican senators cannot get through what they are working on now, they must immediately return to their work, and then re-editorize them later! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 30 June 2017 after two weeks, repeat this line. \"The Republicans must now fail to take care of Obama and work on a new health-care plan that will start from a clean page,\" Tramp tweeted July 17, 2017. \"Dems will join!\" Only Republicans must now fail to take care of Obama and work on a new health-care plan that will start from a clean page. Donald J. Trump (e.g., July 18, 2017, Congressional Budget Office) estimates that the annulment bill will result in another 32 million people without insurance by 2026. The impact will not come immediately, but will rise rapidly, from 17 million in the first year to 27 million in three years, adding another 5 million by the end of the period. The Sanders campaign referred to this estimate as evidence that Trump wanted to deprive 32 million people of the health care they would otherwise have received. But part of that 32 million would have opted not to buy insurance because of the end of the individual mandate. CBO doesn't estimate an exact number because there are two ways this works. Some people don't buy just because they no longer face punishment, others will cut coverage because premiums will rise or insurance companies will withdraw from the markets in which they live. (The end of the mandate would encourage healthier people to stop buying, leave patients in the insurance pool, and produce higher prices.) For this unknown part of the people who could have provided insurance and simply chose not to buy because they didn't have to, their insurance wasn't taken away. It was something they didn't want. In the end, no health-care bill was adopted. Our judge Saunders said that Trump wants to fire 32 million people from their health care. This is based on the encouragement in the Senate to vote in favour of the Abolition Bill. Three years later, this measure would have reduced the ranks of insured persons by 27 million and 32 million after nine years. These are the government's estimates for the future, not the people who might lose insurance immediately, as some might understand Sanders' words. In addition, the 32 million people include an unknown number of people who choose not to buy Soleil for insurance because of the end of individual jurisdiction. Furthermore, Trump also supported measures that would reduce the number of insured persons by 23 million and 22 million. This makes it more difficult to link it to a specific reduction in the number of insured persons. It is reasonable to say that Trump has supported the loss of insurance for tens of millions of people over time, but no more. We're assessing this claim half right.
