Jon Runyan \"voted to redefine rape.\"", "truth_label": "false", "date": "stated on October 10, 2012 in a campaign event:", "title": "Shelley Adler claims Jon Runyan voted to redefine rape", "text": "Democratic congressional hopeful Shelley Adler says the voting record of her Republican opponent, Rep. Jon Runyan, stands as \"proof that we can't trust him to be on our side.\"\n\nBut one piece of Adler\u2019s evidence against Runyan doesn\u2019t hold up against the facts. \u00a0\n\nAt an Oct. 10 campaign event, Adler -- who is challenging Runyan on Nov. 6 for the seat representing the state\u2019s third congressional district -- listed the reasons women should be wary of her opponent.\n\n\"We can\u2019t trust him to stand up for women, after he sponsored legislation that would allow insurance companies to deny women access to birth control and basic preventive health care services. He voted to cut off critical, life-saving health care for women that included cancer screenings, like mammograms, and even voted to redefine rape,\" Adler said. \"That\u2019s not being on our side.\"\n\nAdler levies a hefty allegation against Runyan in claiming he voted to redefine rape, but it\u2019s just not true.\n\nAdler\u2019s charge -- which her campaign has repeated before -- stems from legislation sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith (R-4th Dist.) called the \"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.\"\n\nThe bill, as introduced, would have permanently restricted federal funding for abortions except in cases of \"forcible rape,\" incest, if the victim was a minor, or to save the life of the mother.\n\nIn September, PolitiFact Wisconsin checked a claim from Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat from Wisconsin, that House Republicans \"tried to change the definition of rape\" and rated it Mostly False.\n\nAs one piece of evidence to support the statement, Moore\u2019s spokeswoman cited Smith\u2019s legislation. But PolitiFact Wisconsin found that House Republicans were not trying to change the definition of rape, per se. Rather, they were trying to limit federal funding for abortions.\n\nSo Adler starts off on a flawed premise. But the charge against Runyan \u00a0-- which Chris Russell, Runyan\u2019s campaign spokesman, called \"just plain despicable\" -- \u00a0is even more misleading because when he cast a vote in favor of Smith\u2019s bill, the word \"forcible\" had been removed.\n\nAdler\u2019s spokesman, Michael Muller, acknowledged the error, saying \"you're right about the vote.\"\n\nSmith first introduced the bill in 2010 when Democrats controlled the House. The legislation went nowhere.\n\nBut the next year Republicans gained control of the House. Smith reintroduced his bill on Jan. 20, 2011.\n\nAs we noted in a previous fact-check, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican nominee for vice president, and Rep. Todd Akin -- a Republican Senate candidate from Missouri who made the controversial remark that pregnancies are rare in cases of \"legitimate rape\" -- both signed on as co-sponsors of Smith\u2019s bill.\n\nRunyan never co-sponsored the legislation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCritics condemned the term \"forcible rape,\" saying it would exclude rapes involving drugs and victims of statutory rape. By February, Smith had agreed to strip the controversial language from the bill.\n\nSo when the House passed the bill on May 4, 2011, the legislation exempted all cases of rape from the ban on federal funding for abortions.\n\nThe legislation passed by 251 to 175, with Runyan voting in favor of the legislation. The Democrat-controlled Senate never voted on the proposal.\n\nSo \u00a0Adler is wrong to claim Runyan voted to redefine rape.\n\nThe vote he cast was in favor of prohibiting federal funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother was at risk.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAdler said Runyan \"voted to redefine rape\" while listing the reasons \"we can\u2019t trust him to stand up for women.\"\n\nThe Democratic congressional hopeful distorts the voting record of her Republican rival with this claim.\n\nHouse Republicans introduced a bill that restricted federal funding for abortions, except in cases of \"forcible rape.\"\n\nRunyan never signed on as a co-sponsor of that legislation. Further, when the bill reached the House floor for a full vote and Runyan voted in favor of it, the word \"forcible\" had been removed.\n\nWe rate Adler\u2019s claim False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10139"}
