The About section at the bottom of this site states, \"This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users.

In the past, he advocated for Georgetown University to offer financial aid for African-American students \"whose forbears were slaves.\"\nBut unlike what the story claimed, Soros does not have any apparent history of trying to eliminate the history of slavery in the United States.\nThe breakingnews365.net article does not specify when the special session was that would have approved the name change. The Washington State Legislature adjourned its last special session July 20, 2017.\nThe Washington State Legislature\u2019s report of all the bills passed in 2017 contains no mention of a bill that changes the name or a recent special session.\nThe statement that Washington state changed its name is made up, so we rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02861"}
