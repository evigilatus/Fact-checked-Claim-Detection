Carlos Trujillo, R-Miami, says he doesn\u2019t know why his \"parent trigger\" bill is creating a partisan fight in the Capitol.\n\nYes, it\u2019s supported by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, but it\u2019s also popular with supporters of President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, he said.\n\n\"This legislation was drafted by President Obama's top advisers. It was drafted by President Clinton\u2019s top advisers,\" he said on March 18, 2013, during the House Education Committee hearing on his bill. \"Gov. Bush is a big supporter of this, so it\u2019s not a partisan issue. I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s turned into that.\"\n\nWe wondered if Trujillo was right about the roots of the parent trigger bill. Did state Democrats miss the bipartisanship memo? The bill in question is HB 867, \"Parent Empowerment in Education.\" The law allows parents at failing schools to demand changes, including asking for public schools to be turned into charter schools.\n\nOpponents say this power already exists under state and federal law, and teachers unions don\u2019t like that public schools could be turned into charter schools. Supporters, like Bush\u2019s Foundation for Florida\u2019s Future, said it gives parents at those schools a \"legal seat at the table\" in turning around a school.\n\nCalifornia became the first state with a parent trigger law in 2010, and states including Texas and Indiana have followed in its footsteps. The nonprofit group Parent Revolution launched the California initiative and is supporting Trujillo\u2019s bill.\n\nAsked to support the claim, Trujillo\u2019s legislative aide Alex Miranda pointed us to the executive director of Parent Revolution, Ben Austin. Austin played a role in drafting the original California legislation, which was introduced by California Democratic Sen. Gloria Romero. That legislation was used as a model for Florida.\n\nAustin\u2019s online biography says he has worked on several Democratic presidential campaigns and inside Clinton\u2019s White House \"in a variety of roles.\" Plus, he was \"an early supporter of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign,\" the website states.\n\nWe asked Parent Revolution for more details about Austin\u2019s working relationship with the presidents, as well as seven other board members and staffers whose bios included Obama or Clinton ties.\n\nParent Revolution spokesman David Phelps told us the group designed California\u2019s legislation to help that state qualify for a grant under Obama\u2019s Race to the Top initiative. But he also said \"the usual political definition of \u2018top adviser\u2019 \" would not apply to their board members and staff.\n\n\"President Obama has spoken frequently (as has Education Secretary Duncan) about the need for parents to be full partners in the decision-making process around their children's education,\" Phelps said. \"Parent trigger and our work at Parent Revolution is a proactive response to those Obama administration calls.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhelps was not aware of Obama or Clinton publicly endorsing the measure. He also stressed that Florida is not using a carbon copy of California\u2019s parent trigger law, as each state \"has its own specific priorities and educational needs, and state legislators write bills accordingly.\"\n\nWe caught up with Pat DeTemple, Parent Revolution senior strategist. DeTemple winced a little when we told him Trujillo\u2019s statement. \"I don\u2019t want to speak for Rep. Trujillo,\" he said. He touched on Austin\u2019s \"political\" role in Clinton\u2019s White House and ticked off a series of Austin\u2019s Democratic credentials.\n\nOkay, but does that make him a top adviser to either Clinton or Obama?\n\n\"No, no,\" DeTemple said. \"I was a general election director for Barack, and I was not a top adviser to him either, you know?\n\nStill, Trujillo has a point about the law attracting national Democratic support, even if Florida Democrats aren\u2019t into it, DeTemple said. He pointed to Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa as examples of high-profile Democrats who support the concept, as well as Obama's former chief of staff, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nOpponents of the parent trigger movement, such as Orlando parent advocacy group Fund Education Now, say talking up liberal credentials is an attempt by supporters of parent trigger \"to blur political lines and to declare support from Democrats for this conservative free-market effort.\"\n\nKathleen Oropeza, co-founder of Fund Education Now, stressed the parent trigger law was picked up as model legislation by the conservative, pro-business advocacy group American Legislative Exchange Council after California\u2019s parent trigger law survived a legal challenge.\n\nShe called Trujillo\u2019s Clinton/Obama claim an overreach.\n\n\"Ben Austin and Mike Trujillo each worked on Obama and Clinton campaigns,\" she said. \"That does not mean that Obama asked to have the trigger law written, or that he supports it.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn trying to persuade Democrats to support his parent trigger bill, Trujillo said, \"This legislation was drafted by President Obama's top advisers. It was drafted by President Clinton\u2019s top advisers.\" He makes it sound as if the legislation were written in the West Wing.\n\nParent groups, unions and activists may disagree vehemently on the bill, but they sound in agreement on one thing: The concept was not drafted by \"top advisers\" to Clinton and Obama. The people who had a hand in creating the legislation would more accurately be described as supporters of Obama and Clinton, not \"top advisers.\" We rate his statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09540"}
