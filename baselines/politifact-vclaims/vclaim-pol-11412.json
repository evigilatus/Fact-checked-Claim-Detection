Bob McDonnell rejected host David Gregory\u2019s contention that the legislation puts Virginia in a socially conservative corner.\n\n\"This bill allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure,\" said McDonnell, a Republican.\n\n\"It\u2019s actually only about seven that have these kind of procedures,\" Gregory interrupted.\n\n\"No, but there\u2019s 23 that require a woman to have an opportunity to see an ultrasound,\" McDonnell replied.\n\nWe wondered if the governor\u2019s number is correct.\n\nDebate over Virginia\u2019s law this winter became a national story when it became clear that the measure would require use of an invasive, transvaginal ultrasound -- even against a woman\u2019s will.\n\nAt McDonnell\u2019s urging, the Republican-led General Assembly eventually passed a toned-down measure mandating that women, at least 24 hours before an abortion, undergo a common abdominal ultrasound in which an imaging wand is rubbed across the stomach. The patient must be offered an opportunity to view the image and hear the fetal heartbeat. Victims of rape and incest are exempt from the law if the molestation or assault was reported to legal authorities.\n\nTaylor Thornley, a spokeswoman for McDonnell, said the governor got his statistics about other states from separate studies by two groups that seldom agree: The Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports women\u2019s access to birth control and abortions; and the National Right to Life Committee, which opposes abortion. Neither group\u2019s research includes Virginia\u2019s law, which will become effective July 1.\n\nThe National Right to Life Committee lists 23 states that have an \"ultrasound option\" and gives a brief description of each law.\n\nGuttmacher lists 21 states with ultrasound laws, including seven that mandate the test be performed before an abortion. Unlike the National Right to Life Committee, Guttmacher does not count North Carolina and Oklahoma, where the mandatory ultrasound laws have been stayed pending court challenges.\n\nGuttmacher shows the wide range of laws:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive states require that ultrasounds are offered to the woman by the provider: Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and Utah.\n\nNine states require that if an ultrasound is conducted to prepare for the abortion, the provider must offer to show the woman the image: Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia.\n\nSix states require an ultrasound for each abortion and the provider must offer to show the woman the image: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nOne state, Texas, \u00a0requires an ultrasound for each abortion and that the provider display and describe the image.\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina and Oklahoma would fit into that final category if not for the court challenges. In the meantime, those states and Wisconsin require that women be given information on how to access ultrasounds. (Utah requires both that the woman be offered an ultrasound and that if the procedure is performed to prepare for the abortion, the woman is offered an opportunity to view the image.)\n\nSo the state requirements range from giving women information on accessing ultrasounds to requiring abortion providers to give ultrasounds and display and describe the image.\n\nElizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the institute, said once Virginia\u2019s law goes into effect in July, it will be listed as requiring an ultrasound before an abortion and that the provider must offer to show the woman the image.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcDonnell, in a carefully worded statement, said the bill he recently signed \"allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure\" before allowing abortions. It is technically correct that 23 states have passed legislation that at least requires women be offered information on how to get ultrasounds before abortions.\n\nBut the governor, in implying Virginia has adopted a mainstream law on ultrasounds, omitted a contradicting fact: Virginia will join only nine states that have passed mandatory ultrasound bills. And the enforcement of the laws in two of those states has been delayed by legal challenges. \u00a0\n\nWhile McDonnell is accurate in saying 23 states have laws that deal with ultrasounds, his claim \u00a0creates a misleading impression by not acknowledging only nine states require the procedure.\nWe rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11412"}
