One of the articles refers to the trade history of Trump in New York as evidence that he takes care of minorities. The entire article reads as follows: \"Only three people have won the Ellis Island Prize for their work within the black community... Rosa Parks 2 3. Mohammed Ali Donald Trump... yet wants you to believe he's racist.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim gets one big mistake: while Donald Trump won the prize, called the Medal of Honor for Ellis Island, it was not for \"work within the black community.\" We've reached out to Ellis Island's honorary association, which runs the award. Society is a non-political organization that promotes diversity and understanding among religious and ethnic groups, as well as the restoration and preservation of Ellis Island. The spokesman, Otto Coca Poletti Fact, reported that Trump was one of several persons to be awarded the medal of honour for Ellis Island in 1986 - the first year in which it was given (the same year Parks and Ali were also beneficiaries). Trump has been selected for the professional contributions that the City of New York has benefited from as a developer, as well as for his German heritage. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher \u2022 January 16, 2021 \"This article is ridiculous and an honest lie,\" said Coca. In the first year, \"People have been honoured with the prize for what they defended more than they did,\" said Coca. For example, parks were honoured to stand in the face of trials. Trump's confession came from \"Good work for New York City\" from his work. The medallion has changed over the years, as Coca said, and now beneficiaries are selected for charitable efforts as well as other contributions. According to an article published on 16 October 1986 in The New York Times, those invited to the Award were selected from more than 15,000 nominations. The article states that the winners were \"a mixture of relatively prominent and unknown citizens\" and were screened by the National Ethnic Alliance of Organizations. The article lists Trump as a recipient, with a \"German developer\" along with his name. A photo taken on October 27, 1986 by Jetty Yvonne Hemsey shows Trump standing next to Parks and Ali at the reception to honour the recipients. Joe DiMaggio, Victor Burg and Anita Bryant also appear in the picture. \"It has nothing to do with the race,\" said Coca about the picture. \"They were all honored for different reasons and they were all standing together, that's the only reason the picture exists.\" Our popular article published on social media claims that Trump \"was only one of three people to win the Ellis Island Award for \"Working within Black Society.\" Trump was awarded the Medal of Honor to Ellis in 1986, but was not honoured to be one of a handful of recipients who helped black society - because of his contributions to real estate. Since then, the Ellis Island Honorary Society has honoured about 100 Americans each year. We value this wrong mail.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00417"}
