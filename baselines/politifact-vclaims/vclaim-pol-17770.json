According to some reports, officers have given no explanation for the arrests.\nWhy? One Instagram post has a theory.\n\"Here is what is going on since Trump labeled ANTIFA a terrorist organization their rights were stripped by the Patriot Act which states if someone is labeled a terrorist they are not afforded due process,\" reads the July 18 post. \"PS: Obama suspended habeas corpus too!\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)\u00a0\nThe Instagram post is a screenshot of a Facebook post from a comedian named Sam Tripoli. We reached out to him for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\n\n(Screenshot from Instagram)\nAntifa stands for \"anti-fascist.\" It\u2019s a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists that\u2019s been around for decades, but has had a resurgence since the election of President Donald Trump.\u00a0\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly blamed antifa activists for the violent protests that erupted after the death of George Floyd in late May. There\u2019s no evidence that antifa played any significant role, but Trump said May 31 that the United States would designate the movement as a terrorist organization.\u00a0\nThe post is inaccurate. Antifa is not a designated terrorist organization, and even if it were, American activists would still have due process rights.\nAntifa isn\u2019t a terrorist organization\nDespite Trump\u2019s tweet, antifa has not been designated as a terrorist organization. It is not listed on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations.\nNational security experts told PolitiFact there is no legal process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. If the Trump administration did try to designate antifa as a terrorist organization, it would likely be challenged in court.\u00a0\nAlso, antifa is not a structured organization \u2014\u00a0it has no leaders and is organized into autonomous local groups.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s a little bit like feminism,\" Mark Bray, a historian and part-time lecturer at Rutgers University, told PolitiFact. \"There are feminist groups just like there are antifa groups, but neither feminism nor antifa is a group.\"\nSecond: If antifa groups were designated terrorists, American activists would still have due process rights thanks to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nThe Patriot Act, which passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, does not give federal officers the right to detain suspected terrorists who are U.S. citizens without probable cause. The legislation mainly expanded law enforcement\u2019s ability to use wiretaps in counter-terrorism investigations. It was re-authorized and revised in 2015 to place limits on how much telecommunication data intelligence agencies can collect from Americans.\nWhat\u2019s going on in Portland?\nIf antifa isn\u2019t a terrorist organization, then why are law enforcement officials detaining protesters in Portland? It has to do with the federal government\u2019s response to ongoing protests over police brutality.\nDemonstrators in Portland have been protesting against police brutality and racism against Black Americans since the death of George Floyd in late May. On July 14, reports surfaced that federal law enforcement agents were using unmarked cars to detain protesters in Portland. Over the next few days, videos shared on social media showed the detentions.\n\nFederal agents in Portland include members of the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and a unit from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. U.S. Border Patrol told CNBC that agents were deployed to Portland in support of a June 26 executive order from Trump and a new Homeland Security task force for protecting American communities.\nThe Trump administration says the officers are needed to restore peace in Portland, where protests devolved into rioting July 18. But Oregon officials and Democrats have criticized the federal government\u2019s crackdown.\u00a0\nThe Oregon attorney general filed a lawsuit July 17 that alleges the federal government violated citizens\u2019 rights by detaining them without probable cause. On July 19, House Democrats called for an investigation into allegations that federal officials were unlawfully arresting protesters. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley \u2014 all Democrats \u2014 have criticized the Trump administration\u2019s use of force against protesters.\nIt\u2019s unclear to what extent antifa activists are among the protesters detained in Portland. The city is home to the oldest antifa cell in the country, and activists associated with the movement have been involved in recent protests there. One purported antifa activist faces charges for alleged crimes that took place during the demonstrations.\nOur ruling\nThe Instagram post claims that, since antifa is a terrorist organization, its members\u2019 due process rights are stripped by the Patriot Act.\nThat\u2019s wrong.\nAntifa is not an organized group and has not been designated as a terrorist organization. Even if it were, American antifa activists would still have due process rights afforded to them by the Constitution. The Patriot Act does not give federal law enforcement officials the right to detain suspected terrorists who are U.S. citizens without probable cause.\nThe Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17770"}
