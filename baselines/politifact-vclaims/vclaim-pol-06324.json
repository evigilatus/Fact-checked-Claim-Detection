Rick Scott's Economic Growth Summit in Orlando:", "title": "Jeb Bush says he cut Florida taxes by $19 billion, but did he really?", "text": "Jeb Bush keeps promoting his record during the runup to announcing his presidential campaign, telling a crowd at a Republican event he cut taxes as Florida\u2019s governor.\n\"In Florida, for eight years we cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion, creating a much better business climate,\" Bush told the crowd at Gov. Rick Scott's Economic Growth Summit in Orlando on June 2, 2015.\nFlorida\u2019s budget went from $48.6 billion to $73.9 billion during Bush\u2019s tenure, thanks in part to an influx of some 3.5 million people. The state also pocketed $10 billion in cash reserves and won a top bond rating.\nBut was he able to help cut taxes by $19 billion at the same time? We cracked open the state\u2019s books to take a look for ourselves.\nProjecting a point of view\nBush\u2019s Right to Rise political action committee told us they came up with the figure (actually $19.3 billion) using data from Florida\u2019s Office of Economic and Demographic Research. This figure has been cited often by both politicians and the media, but the details are where things get tricky.\nWithout putting you to sleep with nitpicking of revenue projections, this is what Right To Rise did: Using an annual state report called the Fiscal Analysis in Brief, the PAC tallied the total of all revenue changes from legislative changes in each year between the 1999-2000 and 2007-08 fiscal years.\nHere\u2019s where we come to our first round of caveats. Economic experts told us those revenue changes aren\u2019t all necessarily tax cuts. Each year includes dozens, if not hundreds of different legislative actions, ranging from fee and license changes to sales tax holidays and lottery proceeds. Those aren\u2019t all what we\u2019d consider tax cuts, they\u2019re just changes in how much the state collected.\nIt\u2019s also a good thing Bush used the term \"we,\" because the revenue changes resulted from action by the Legislature. Bush\u2019s influence and his line-item veto power did come into play, but he can\u2019t take credit for all of these measures. He has said, \"I cut taxes to the tune of $19 billion\" before, though.\nRight to Rise added up those cumulative revenue changes for each year and developed a formula to estimate how much state revenues have been affected since. Our experts told us that\u2019s acceptable, but it makes things more complicated.\nIt means, for example, that if taxes were cut in 1999, Right to Rise counted those revenue changes for each subsequent year through 2007. By the end of Bush\u2019s term, we\u2019re looking at eight years of cumulative tax savings. If you really want to read the fine print, you can see the PAC\u2019s estimates here.\nThe nominal dollars saved using those projections totaled more than $17.6 billion, but the PAC adjusted the estimate into 2007 dollars. That leaves us with the $19.3 billion estimate.\nEconomists told us while it was fine to adjust the projections for inflation, there are limitations to that estimate. That\u2019s mostly because analysts don\u2019t really know what would happen to any given revenue source in the real world.\n\"I think it\u2019s kind of tough to make this kind\u00a0of analysis, because the economic impact is listed, but would change as the economy changed,\" Norton Francis, a senior research associate with the Urban Institute, told us. \"They\u2019re basically looking at a point in time, going back and revisiting it.\"\nTwo big specifics\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re still with us at this depth of wonkishness, there\u2019s more to consider.\nA big chunk of the $19.3 billion in projected tax savings came from the 2001 law to phase out the federal estate tax, which was backed in Washington by Bush\u2019s brother, then-President George W. Bush. The state essentially received a share of this federal tax, but lost that money when the phase-out was complete. According to the PAC\u2019s projections, by the 2007-08 fiscal year that loss of estate tax money cost Florida about $848 million per year.\nSources told PolitiFact that it\u2019s not really right for Jeb Bush to take credit for the federal repeal, because the state didn\u2019t do anything.\n\"It\u2019s not like anyone in Florida got rid of it,\" Francis said. \"The federal government got rid of it.\"\nBush spokesman Matt Gorman said Bush supported the repeal of the tax as governor, and didn\u2019t push to replace it with a state tax. Several states did enact their own tax to make up for the lost revenue.\nOne review by economist Martin Sullivan, writing for tax news publisher Tax Analysts, omitted the estate tax in his report because it didn\u2019t require legislative action to go into effect. His analysis, which wasn\u2019t adjusted for inflation, tallied the total of Bush-era tax cuts over those eight years at about $13 billion.\nOf note is where the biggest chunk of Bush\u2019s claimed tax savings came from: A change in the amount the state taxed intangible assets, like stocks, bonds and accounts receivable. Florida made about $600 million per year from the tax, a fair sum for a state with no income tax.\nBush pushed hard to trim the tax in 1999 and 2000. He finally succeeded repealing the tax entirely in 2006.\nFrancis said that point gets\u00a0lost when people use a big number like $19 billion.\n\"When you\u2019re looking at the intangibles tax, what were the benefits of that?\" Francis said. \"Was any of it good for the average person?\"\nKurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, which supported ending the tax, pointed out that removing it benefitted people with lower incomes and assets for years, because the exemption was gradually increased before the tax was repealed entirely.\n\"People considered it a benefit for the rich because the income limits were so high at the end,\" Wenner said. \"Really, just about anyone who had any amount saved up saw a benefit.\"\nSullivan\u2019s analysis provided one answer most people can probably wrap their heads around. He concluded the real Bush-era tax savings by 2006 ended up being about $140 per person, per year.\nOur ruling\nBush said \"for eight years we cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion.\"\nHe was citing a projection from his Right To Rise PAC that measured cumulative revenue changes from 1999 to 2007. The total of $19.3 billion is adjusted into 2007 dollars. The analysis includes the federal repeal of the estate tax, for which economists told us Bush couldn\u2019t really take credit. It also includes a big cut to the state\u2019s intangibles tax, which may not benefit your average person much.\nExperts said there are limits to how economists can estimate the impact of legislative actions, but the PAC\u2019s projections could be considered fair. What\u2019s trickier is whether Bush can take credit for all the revenue changes or even call them all tax cuts.\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
