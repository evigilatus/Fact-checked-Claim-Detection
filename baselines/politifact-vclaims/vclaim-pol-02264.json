Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently cheerleaded West Virginia small businesses in a tweet from his Senate account.\nManchin tweeted, \"Did you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday\"\nDid you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday\u2014 Senator Joe Manchin (@Sen_JoeManchin) March 21, 2018\n\n\nWe were surprised that small companies comprise 96 percent of West Virginia\u2019s economy, so we took a closer look. As it turns out, Manchin used the wrong terminology, ultimately making his claim incorrect.\nWe turned to data from the federal Small Business Administration, which offers fact sheets about small businesses in every state.\nManchin\u2019s in the ballpark for the number of small businesses in the state. The SBA counts 115,673 small businesses, a number that is apt to fluctuate regularly, as companies start up and go out of business. (The agency\u2019s definition of a small business is one with fewer than 500 employees.)\nAnd the fact sheet has a number close to the 96 percent figure Manchin cited. The SBA says that 98.9 percent of West Virginia\u2019s businesses are small businesses.\nBut that does not support what Manchin said. Saying that almost 99 percent of West Virginia's businesses are small firms is not what economists refer to as a \"percentage of the economy.\" That term refers to the percentage of all economic output, which is sometimes called state-level gross domestic product.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact sheet doesn\u2019t provide small business output as a percentage of the economy, but it\u2019s certainly well below 96 percent.\nWhy? Because while small businesses account for nearly 99 percent of employers in the state, they only account for about half \u2014\u00a050.1 percent \u2014 of West Virginia employees. So it is\u00a0not credible to say that half of the workforce produces 96 percent of the output while the other half \u2014 the big-company workforce \u2014\u00a0produces just 4 percent of output.\nIn fact, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the half of West Virginia employees working for big companies account for more than half of economic output, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.\n\"In the nation as a whole, employees at smaller businesses tend to earn lower compensation than employees in larger businesses, probably indicating they are less productive,\" Burtless said. \"All these facts lead me to believe there is no possible way those 120,000 small businesses can account for 96 percent of the production or output of the West Virginia economy.\"\nManchin\u2019s office declined to comment for this article.\nOur ruling\nManchin said that small businesses in West Virginia \"make up about 96 percent of our state's economy.\"\nThis appears to be a case of mistaken terminology. Small businesses do make up nearly 99 percent of the state\u2019s employers, but only half of its employees. The way it is worded, Manchin's claim exaggerates the output of small businesses and underplays the economic influence of large companies in the state.\u00a0\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-26 22:06:53 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Small businesses in West Virginia \"make up about 96 percent of our state's economy.\"    Joe Manchin U.S. Senator, D-W.Va. https://twitter.com/Sen_JoeManchin/status/976533912422944768   a tweet Wednesday, March 21, 2018 2018-03-21    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02264"}
