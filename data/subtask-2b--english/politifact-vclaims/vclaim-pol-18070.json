Bernie Sanders was going to win the Nevada Democratic caucuses held on Feb. 22, the presidential candidate was declared the frontrunner. But a Facebook post published the next day wasn\u2019t impressed with his big win.\n\"Bernie only had 3,444 votes in NV,\" it says. \"There is more people than that waiting to pee at a Trump rally.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nActually, Sanders snagged 41,075 votes, according to the Washington Post. He was followed by former Vice President Joe Biden (19,179 votes), former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (17,598) and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (11,703).\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

County convention delegates are the number of county delegates each candidate gets at the state Democratic convention. That, in turn, determines how many national pledged delegates each candidate gets.\u00a0\nBut even if that\u2019s where this post drew its data, the figure is still wrong. In the end, Sanders had 6,788 county convention delegates and 24 pledged national delegates.\u00a0\nTo secure the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for president, Sanders (or another candidate) will need 1,991 national delegates. As of March 5, Sanders had 459, Biden had 513 and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard had two.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18070"}
