It included a picture of a PayPal account with a balance of $3.46 million.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIt\u2019s a hoax.\nThere are two ways to tell.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the easy way. Multiply $1,000 by 100,000 and you get $100 million -- not the $3.4 million Rogers said he had.\nSecond, if you performed a reverse Google image search of the picture Rogers included, you would find that this image, and gimmick, has been used before.\nThe Twitter user @calebproera used the same image in a post Oct. 22. It popped up on a different Facebook timeline with the same message on Oct. 8.\nAnd if you searched the caption Rogers wrote, you would see the same post from a different Facebook user Oct. 8 and another version from a different Twitter user Oct. 6. And, for good measure, again on from Sept. 16.\nSorry if you thought the free money was on its way.\nIt\u2019s not. This claim rates Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01358"}
