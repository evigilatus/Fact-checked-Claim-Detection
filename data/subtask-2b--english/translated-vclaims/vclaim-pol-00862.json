Robert Sanborn, President and CEO of non-profit children at risk, said that parents must make \"hard choices\" when it comes to choosing the day-care option for their children because of financial constraints and the different quality of the facilities. \"At present, only 11% of 15,000 childcare providers in Texas have certified that they meet quality standards,\" said Sanborn before stopping and reiterating the demand for confirmation. \"We must do more.\" Childcare providers in Texas must meet the minimum standards approved by the State. Furthermore, they can participate in a voluntary government programme and in several national certification programmes for service providers that meet higher standards. Is it true that only 11% of Texas childcare providers are certified through these programs? Researchers in the non-profit organization said that it was the minimum standards versus quality standards that calculated the percentage of this demand by identifying childcare providers who participated in government and national programmes assessing the quality of caregivers. Childcare operations in Texas, ranging from those managed through an individual home to those carried out from a centre, must be approved by the State. In order to be qualified, service providers must meet minimum standards based on the type and size of the operation, and must undergo a certain number of inspections by State agents. Carrie Williams, spokesman for the Texas Health and Humanitarian Services Committee, which oversees the licensing and registration of service providers, said that the Agency did not evaluate facilities on the basis of their relative quality. \"Our focus is on whether or not facilities meet the standards established to ensure the health and safety of children in care,\" she said in an e-mail. These minimum standards differ from the quality standards to which Sanborn refers in his claim. If the service providers meet the minimum requirements of the State, they are eligible for accreditation from a voluntary government programme and several national organizations. This would allow them to be \"verified as meeting quality standards,\" as Sanborn said. These programmes usually require processes to meet standards related to staff training and education, curricula and classroom size. Many also require a fee. At the state level, the rising star of Texas is the existing voluntary quality assessment programme. It includes three levels of certification, each with progressively stricter standards. Service providers can qualify for the programme only if they participate in the Texas Labour Force Commission programme, which supports childcare costs for low-income families. She said that Sanborn's claim had also been considered by four national organizations, including the National Young Children's Education Association, the National Accreditation Commission, the adoption of the National Early Childhood Programme and the International Christian School Association. The figures add to Everett that the group &apos; s findings were recent in September 2018, and shared a table of data collected from a few different sources, including a list of all Texas childcare providers and lists of Texas service providers participating in Texas Rice Star and the four identified national non-profit programs. According to their research, of the 15,036 registered service providers in Texas in September, 1,501 service providers (about 10 per cent) participated in the \"Texas rising star\" and/or one of the four national programmes identified by children at risk. Everett said that the Group had added an additional percentage point to its conclusions to account for any suppliers that might participate in smaller national accreditation programmes. We have collected the same data ourselves, using the most recent figures available from each organization. At the end of March, there were 14,716 childcare providers in Texas registered with the State. Of these, about 1,400 (or about 10 per cent) are approved through the Upstairs Stars Programme in Texas. The membership lists submitted by each of the four national organizations included a total of 464 service providers in Texas. This means that it is fair to say that between 10 and 13 per cent of Texas service providers are certified as meeting quality standards through at least one of these five voluntary accreditation programmes, since some service providers can be certified by multiple organizations. Sanborn said, \"Only 11% of the 15,000 child-care providers in Texas believe that they meet quality standards.\" The calculations behind the claim have been verified, but Sanborn has ignored the important context of what standards are being considered. He referred to the percentage of childcare providers who participated in voluntary programmes with higher quality standards than the minimum standards required to obtain State approval for employment. We're mostly assessing this claim right. In fact, this statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
