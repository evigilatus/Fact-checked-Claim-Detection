They cannot,\" Gingrich said. \"And yet Hillary wants to increase the number by 500 percent.\nClinton has been called out on this before \u2014 by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\nThe basis for the claim stems from a Sept. 20, 2015, interview with Clinton on CBS' Face the Nation. Host John Dickerson asked Clinton if President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to increase the number of Syrians allowed in the country to 10,000 was enough. (The United States had accepted about 2,000 by 2015.)\nClinton said she would like to see even more refugees allowed into the country \u2014 suggesting as much as a 550 percent increase.\n\"Look, we\u2019re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more,\" Clinton said, \"and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.\"\nIn a speech in December 2015, Clinton said, \"It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones.\"\nShe also said there had to be vigilant screening and vetting of refugees from Syria and that such process historically takes up to two years. The estimated wait checks out.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGingrich says the government cannot adequately screen Syrian refugees. The refugees admissions process actually involves the FBI as well as the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies.\nFBI director James Comey has said there are challenges and could be gaps in any admissions process of refugees from a conflict zone. However, Gingrich failed to acknowledge the lengthy process before any refugee is admitted into the United States that includes in-person interviews, health screenings and referrals by nongovernmental agencies.
