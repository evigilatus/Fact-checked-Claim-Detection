(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe story falsely claims that Obama freed al-Baghdadi, who died in a raid by U.S. forces in October 2019, from U.S. custody. Its headline: \"\u2018He\u2019s low risk,\u2019 said Obama before freeing ISIS leader al Baghdadi.\"\nBut that allegation about Obama is False. We\u2019ve fact-checked it several times before.\nObama wasn\u2019t in office when the United States had al-Baghdadi\nThe AJUANews.com story seems to have been lifted word-for-word from a November article with the same headline on ObamaWatcher, a site that says it posts conservative satire.\u00a0\nThat ObamaWatcher story is tagged as \"Barack Obama Fan Fiction\" on the site. It says Obama was responsible for al-Baghdadi\u2019s release from U.S. custody in 2004.\nObama, however, was first elected president in 2008.\nWhen we first looked into al-Baghdadi\u2019s release, the Defense Department told us the future ISIS leader was held at a U.S. detention facility in Iraq known as Camp Bucca from early February 2004 until early December 2004. There\u2019s no record of him being held at any other time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaghdadi was not freed by the United States, either. Rather, the United States handed him over to the Iraqis, who released him some time later.\nSome politicians, pundits and news outlets have inaccurately claimed Obama let al-Baghdadi go in 2009. That misconception tracks back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca.\nKing said he recalled al-Baghdadi leaving in 2009 and saying, \"I\u2019ll see you guys in New York.\" King later told ABC News he \"could be mistaken\" and that al-Baghdadi\u2019s \"face is very familiar.\"\nA U.S.-Iraq agreement did drive the transfer of many detainees to Iraq in 2009, but that framework was set up by President George W. Bush in 2008.\nThe Defense Department said al-Baghdadi was not in U.S. custody in 2009. And an article in the Guardian quoted another ISIS commander talking about meeting al-Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2004. The article said he was transferred because officials saw nothing of concern.\nWe also found no evidence that Obama, then an Illinois state senator who had just won election to the Senate, said al-Baghdadi was \"low risk\" when he was released in 2004 \u2014 or ever.\u00a0\nThe Obama administration designated al-Baghdadi a global terrorist in a 2011 federal notice.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nAJUANews.com said, \"\u2018He\u2019s low risk,\u2019 said Obama before freeing ISIS leader al Baghdadi.\"\nThe ISIS leader was removed from U.S. custody and handed over to Iraq in 2004, before Obama was president. There\u2019s no evidence Obama played any role in that transfer.\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17590"}
