The article was republished from a website called Great Game India.\n\"Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab,\" the story reads. \"Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.\"\nThe story weaves together unrelated facts to construct a conspiracy theory. Officials are still trying to determine the exact cause of the outbreak, but there\u2019s no evidence of it being created for use as a bioweapon.\n\n(Screenshot from Zero Hedge)\nThe article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But there\u2019s no evidence for that.\nThe story focuses on the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. In 2013, researchers there were investigating a new cluster of coronavirus infections that appeared to have originated in Saudi Arabia.\u00a0\nGreat Game India implies that disease is the same one that\u2019s currently affecting China. But the lab was examining the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.

Qiu, her husband and her students from China were removed from the lab in July 2019.\nThere are questions about what information Qiu shared with Chinese officials while visiting Wuhan, and the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory has sent viruses to China in the past for research. But there is no evidence to support the claim that Qiu stole coronavirus samples and gave them to the Wuhan lab to create biological weapons.\nThe Wuhan lab\nThe assertion that the origin of the coronavirus outbreak is a Chinese lab near Wuhan also lacks evidence.\nThe Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world\u2019s most dangerous pathogens, such as Ebola and the SARS coronavirus. Some experts have linked the lab to China\u2019s biological warfare program. The country denies having such a program, but the State Department has raised concerns about China\u2019s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons.\n\"Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus,\" the Great Game India story reads.\nAs of now, however, the lab\u2019s proximity to the seafood market is a coincidence, as there is no evidence that the lab is the source of the coronavirus outbreak.\nRELATED:\u00a0No, there is no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus\nThe CDC and the World Health Organization are still investigating the cause of the coronavirus outbreak. In its most recent situation summary, the CDC said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the Wuhan coronavirus.\nTheir findings suggest \"a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus.\" Early reports suggested that the disease appeared to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to several Asian countries, Australia, France, Canada and the United States.\nOur ruling\nA Zero Hedge story claims that Chinese agents stole coronavirus samples from Canada to create a biological weapon, which has now caused an outbreak of the disease around the world.\nA Chinese scientist who worked in a Canadian lab studying coronaviruses is under investigation for trips she took to Wuhan. But there\u2019s no evidence she gave China coronavirus samples to develop a biological weapon. Plus, the lab worked on MERS, not the Wuhan coronavirus. The Wuhan lab mentioned in the story does deal with dangerous pathogens like coronaviruses, but there is no evidence that it is the source of the latest outbreak.\nThe story lacks evidence for its headline, so we rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17645"}
