The Mimi says, \"Would you like to understand better why we have a federal deficit? In 1952, the corporate income tax accounted for 33 per cent of all federal tax revenues. Today, despite the accumulated profits, corporate taxes bring in less than 9 percent. It's time for real tax reform.\" The reader asked us to verify his claim, so we did. First, we can confirm that corporate profits are very close to their highest level ever. This chart by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows that post-tax corporate profits as a percentage of GDP reached their historic peak in the third quarter of 2013, before falling marginally since then. But what about corporate taxes as a percentage of all federal tax revenues? Sanders is basically on the mark here, too. These are the relevant historical data from the Office of Administrative and Budgetary Questions. The first graph appears in 1952. The first row contains raw dollars and the second row shows the percentage of all tax revenues represented by taxes: individual income taxes imposed on companies in 1952, income taxes on social insurance and retirement taxes. \u2022 11 January 2021 Company income and social insurance taxes and retirement taxes The 2013 number is slightly higher than Sanders said, but his claim is basically accurate on the numbers. However, the measure that Sanders used might not be the best. The economists told us that it would be more useful to know corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP. But looking at it this way, the general pattern remains so. In 1952, corporate taxes accounted for 5.9 per cent of GDP, a figure that fell to 1.6 per cent today. So Saunders has the point that corporate tax collection declined as a percentage of all taxes collected, even as corporate profits rose to record levels. However, a group of economists presented two parts of the precautionary context that deserved consideration. \u2022 In 1952, it is chosen to some extent by cherry. That year ranks third in history for corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP. Daniel Mitchell, economist at the Cato Institute, said: \"The time was when the United States was the dilemma of the global economy and faced very little competition from foreign firms.\" However, even recently in 1979, corporate taxes accounted for 2.6 per cent of GDP, a percentage point higher than today. So the slope is real, even if it's used a year later. \u2022 Most of today's business revenues are taxed through the Individual Income Tax Act, not through the Companies Act. This relates to discrimination that only the Coalition Provisional Authority can love. One type of company, \"C,\" pays corporate income taxes on its profits. Another type, S, pays taxes on its profits through the owner &apos; s individual income tax returns. \"changes in tax rates and tax rules for C and S companies contributed to an increase in the number of companies that became S-corps and thus paid the individual income tax instead of the company income tax,\" said Kyle Pomerlio, an economist with the tax institution. This has enhanced individual income tax collection and reduced corporate income tax collection. Between 1980 and 2010, the category of business involving S companies, sole owner companies, partnerships and limited liability companies increased by 10.9 million to over 30 million, while the number of companies declined, as Pomerlaw said. This means that there are fewer companies to pay the corporate income tax. In addition, the volume of business revenues generated by these types of business has also increased, as Bomerlao said. Between 1980 and 2010, this income increased fivefold, from $320 billion to over $1.6 trillion. \"In fact, the latest data show that business (these) earns a larger total net income than traditional C companies,\" said Pomerlaw. \"In 1980, it was the exact opposite.\" Roberton Williams, a colleague at the Urban Institute - Brookings Institution Centre for Tax Policy, agreed that looking at companies C alone produced a cloudy image. \"It's hard to say what share of income will come from today's corporate income tax if these changes do not occur,\" he said: \"In 1952, corporate income tax accounted for 33 per cent of all federal tax revenues. Today, despite standard profits, corporate taxes bring in less than 9 percent.\" If official figures are used, Sanders is right, but it should be noted that the figure for individual income taxes now includes a large part of the taxes on corporate profits. That distorts the other clear picture Sanders is trying to paint. Anyway, we're assessing his claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07377"}
