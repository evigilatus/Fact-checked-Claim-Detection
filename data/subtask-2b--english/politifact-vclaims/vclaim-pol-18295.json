This was the ruling of The United States Supreme Court shortly after the \u2018civil war\u2019 in Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866) which yet stands to this day: \u2018Neither the legislature nor any executive or judicial officer may disregard the provisions of the constitution in case of emergency \u2026\u2019\n\u2026 therefore, ANYONE who declares the suspension of constitutionally guaranteed rights (to freely travel, peacefully assemble, earn a living, freely worship, etc.) and or attempts to enforce such suspension within 50 independent, sovereign, continental United States of America is making war against our constitution(s) and, therefore, we the people. They violate their constitutional oath and, thus, immediately forfeit their office and authority and their proclamations may be disregarded with impunity and that means ANYONE; even the governor and President.\"\nThe cited case, Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866), was about disputed judicial authority during the Civil War. In 1864, Lambdin P. Milligan was arrested and tried by a military tribunal in his home state of Indiana and sentenced to death by hanging. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the military courts established by the president during wartime had no judicial power in secure areas with established civil courts, and Milligan was released.\u00a0\nThe case citation and time frame in the post are legitimate. But the quote about government authority does not come from this case.\u00a0\nThat quote, or a close match, comes from a case argued in the Illinois Supreme Court in 1935. In People ex rel. Lyle vs. City of Chicago, the justices of Chicago\u2019s municipal court filed a complaint against the City Council over unpaid salaries amid the Depression. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled in their favor and ordered the city to pay them the partial salaries that had been withheld.\nIn his opinion, the Illinois chief justice said that \"neither the legislature nor any executive or judicial officer may disregard the provisions of the constitution even in case of a great emergency.\" He was referring to the Illinois Constitution and the Municipal Court of Chicago\u2019s founding laws.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second part of this claim that says orders \"can be disregarded with impunity\" doesn\u2019t come from either of these cases and wasn\u2019t found in any court cases or acts.\u00a0\nWe also found ample evidence that states do have the authority to issue stay-at-home orders. According to the American Bar Association, the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 10th Amendment and past U.S. Supreme Court decisions dictate that \"state governments have the primary authority to control the spread of dangerous diseases within their jurisdictions.\"\u00a0\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that there haven\u2019t been cases brought against governors and local governments in California, Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania that are attempting to prove stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional. There have been mixed results from local courts, which all base their decisions on state laws and constitutions.\u00a0\nRight now, the Supreme Court refuses to take a side. On May 8, the high court declined to review a case from a group of Pennsylvania businesses\u2019 that wanted to block Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s stay-at-home order.\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has supported state\u2019s rights to deal with public health emergencies. The best example of the Supreme Court supporting a state\u2019s power to impose mandatory restrictions during a pandemic is Jacobson vs. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905).\u00a0\nThe case was brought against the Cambridge board of health and its response to a surge in smallpox cases in the city. The city\u2019s board of health issued an order that all adults had to be vaccinated against the disease, or they would face a $5 fine (about $100 today). Henning Jacobson refused to be vaccinated, after having bad reactions to earlier vaccines. When the state of Massachusetts fined him, he appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00a0\nThe court ruled in the state\u2019s favor, stating that they had full power to restrict the freedoms of any citizen if it \"is necessarily subject for the common good\" and that they had \"distinctly recognized the authority of a State to enact quarantine laws and \u2018health laws of every description.\u2019\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims that under an 1866 Supreme Court ruling, stay-at-home orders are illegal and can be disregarded with impunity.\nThe claim cites an actual Supreme Court case, but it quotes a judicial opinion from an unrelated state case in Illinois dealing with judges\u2019 salaries.
