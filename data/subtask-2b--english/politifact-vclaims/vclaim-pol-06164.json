He then contrasted Florida\u2019s success with the beleaguered European nation.\n\"A country in economic peril, Greece\u2019s priorities have historically been very different from Florida\u2019s,\" Atwater wrote\u00a0on July 13, 2015. \"For example, Greeks depend much more on their government for employment and services. Although we have twice the population of Greece, the State of Florida employs three times fewer government employees.\"\nPunditFact previously confirmed that Greece\u2019s economic output is\u00a0comparable to Miami, but could that 3-to-1 comparison of public-sector workers be accurate? Yes, if you\u2019re looking at Florida\u2019s direct employees, but experts we talked to said Atwater\u2019s comparison is deeply flawed.\nGreek tragedy\nFirst of all, let\u2019s stipulate that Greece\u2019s population is about\u00a011 million, while the Census Bureau says Florida is now closing in on\u00a020 million, so he\u2019s close on that point.\nComparing employment is a bit trickier, since Greece\u2019s public-sector employment has been in flux. To adhere to what its European lenders are demanding, Greece has spent several years trying to cut down its reliance on public-sector jobs.\nAtwater\u2019s office told us they used 2013 data from Greece\u2019s Ministry of Administrative Reform and E-Governance for Greek government workers (653,746) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Current Employment Statistics program for Florida state employees (207,008).\u00a0\nSeveral sources agreed 2015 estimates put the current number of Greek public-sector employees at around 600,000. Florida\u2019s employee numbers have stayed relatively stable in that time frame, with about 208,000 this year, so it looks like the 3-to-1 ratio Atwater cited could stand.\u00a0\nBut our experts said the CFO is really comparing oranges to olives here.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRollins College business professor James Johnson pointed out that those 600,000 Greek jobs include all government workers -- those paid by the central government and those paid by regional and municipal governments.\nA better way to measure the state\u2019s government employment would be to add Florida\u2019s 133,000 or so federal workers to Atwater\u2019s 207,000 total, Rollins said. And even more important are the more than 730,000 workers toiling away at the local level. Also, Washington sends money to Florida that directly and indirectly affects workers at the state and local levels.\nAdd that all up, and there are almost 1.1 million government employees on all levels across Florida at any given time. That is quite a bit more than the 600,000 or so Greek government workers.\u00a0\nExperts also note that Greek economic woes aren\u2019t entirely about how\u00a0many\u00a0people are currently employed by the government.\n\"Greece\u2019s problem was not so much the size of its public sector, but generous retirement benefits, including pensions,\" Johnson said. Greece doesn\u2019t even top Europe in terms of highest percentage of the workforce employed by the public sector. In 2011, before Greece started cutting workers, it ranked behind\u00a0Italy, Germany and France.\nIn any event, fairly comparing a single U.S. state with a sovereign nation is largely impossible, considering the different sets of responsibilities each bears, our experts said.\u00a0\nAtwater\u2019s office reiterated that it was making a point that the Greek central government is wasteful and poorly run when compared to Florida, but experts told us that it\u2019s difficult at best to draw such parallels.\n\"It\u2019s sort of a totally different system. It is fair to say the state of Florida is more efficient than the country of Greece, but you could say that about any other state,\" Jupiter-based financial analyst Tom Essaye said. \"It would be much more fair to compare Florida to other states than Greece.\"\nOur ruling\nAtwater said, \"the State of Florida employs three times fewer government employees\" than Greece.\nFlorida does directly employ about one-third as many state government workers as Greece does. But a more reasonable comparison should also include government workers at the federal and local levels -- which means Florida\u2019s overall total of government workers would outnumber Greece\u2019s public-sector employees.\u00a0\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
