The video clip shows Comey and Rogers confirming they have no evidence indicating that Russia altered vote tallies\u00a0on Election Day in swing states like Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.\u00a0\nBut vote tallying is only one aspect of the electoral process, and it\u2019s not the only aspect of the campaign that Comey and Rogers talked about.\nComey and Rogers said they believe Russia meddled in the race leading up to Election Day, chiefly by cyber-infiltrating the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. Contrary to Trump\u2019s tweet, they also said the intelligence community did not assess whether Russia\u2019s actions actually had a measurable impact on the election outcome or public opinion.\nBecause Trump sent out his tweet before the hearing ended, Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., was able to ask Comey and Rogers about it.\n\"We\u2019ve offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact because it\u2019s never something that we\u2019ve looked at,\" Comey said.\nBut there\u2019s no question from their testimony that Rogers and Comey believe that Russia wanted to influence the election:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Mike Conaway, R-Texas, asked: \"Both your agencies agree with the assessment that the Russians' goal was to undermine the public faith in U.S. democratic process. Is that still your assessments?\"\n\u2022\u00a0Comey and Rogers both said \"yes\" when Conaway asked them if they still agreed with the intelligence community\u2019s January conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to harm former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and, by extension, help Trump.\n\"I don't know for sure (when we made that judgment), but I think that was a fairly easy judgment for the community,\" Comey said. \"Putin hated Secretary Clinton so much, that the flipside of that coin was he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much.\"\n\u2022\u00a0 Comey said Russia\u2019s interference stood out because it was so \"noisy,\" possibly in an attempt to cause panic among the American public. \"They were unusually loud in their intervention,\" he said. \"It\u2019s almost as if they didn\u2019t care that we knew what they were doing or that they wanted us to see what they were doing.\"\nWe reached out to the White House for comment but didn't hear back.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process.\"\nRogers and Comey never said this \u2014 not in the video clip Trump shared, nor at any point in the five-hour hearing.\nRather, they said they believe Russia interfered in the presidential election, in an attempt to help Trump and undermine the democratic process. They said they don\u2019t know one way or the other if that interference actually did affect public opinion or the outcome of the election.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    5 7  Politifact Rating: False  \"The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process.\"    Donald Trump President   in a tweet Monday, March 20, 2017 03/20/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03537"}
