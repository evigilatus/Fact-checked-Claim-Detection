Big country, 1.4 billion people, right. Not much of a drug problem. I said what do you attribute that to? \u2018Well, the death penalty.\u2019\"\nOn Singapore, \"I said, Mr. President, what happens with your drugs? \u2018No. We don't have a problem, President.\u2019 I said, really why? \u2018We have a zero tolerance.\u2019 And he is not playing games \u2026 So what do you mean no problem? \u2018We have a zero tolerance policy.\u2019 What does that mean? \u2018That means if we catch a drug dealer, death penalty.\u2019 \"\nPolitiFact decided to fact-check whether China and Singapore have the death penalty for drug dealers as Trump claimed. (We will set aside for now whether these countries\u00a0have \"no\" drug problems as a result, as Trump claimed the leaders said.)\nWe found those countries do have the death penalty for individuals who traffic, smuggle or transport certain drugs. The White House did not comment on the record, but in the context of Trump\u2019s speech, it appears these are the individuals he was referring to when speaking about \"drug dealers\" \u2014 not just individuals who may sell drugs on the streets.\nNonetheless, China and Singapore have also been called out as human rights abusers for these practices, and drug policy and law experts expressed skepticism about the death penalty being a deterrent for drug trafficking in the United States.\nChina\u2019s laws\nChinese law says that individuals who smuggle, traffic, transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions are to be punished with 15 years of fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment or death sentence, and confiscation of their properties.\nThe law mentions certain amounts of opium, heroin, methylaniline and \"other narcotic drugs of large quantities.\"\nHuman rights groups and experts say data on death sentences and executions in China is unreliable and unknown. That information is kept as a state secret. Amnesty International\u00a0estimates thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death each year.\nGiven data limitations, it's difficult to assess the efficacy of its policy against drug offenders.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore's law\nSingapore\u2019s Misuse of Drugs Act calls for the death penalty for individuals convicted of trafficking specified amounts of opium, cocaine, cannabis, and other substances. The law said the word \"traffic\" means to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute.\nIndividuals possessing certain amounts of specified drugs are also presumed to have it for the purpose of trafficking, unless proven otherwise. Recent law revisions give courts discretion not to impose the death penalty in certain circumstances.\nA\u00a0March 2010 study\u00a0on executions, deterrence\u00a0and homicide in Hong Kong and Singapore said there are \"no decent indicators\" available regarding drug use over time in Singapore, and if the data exists, \"they are a government secret.\"\nSingapore\u2019s minister for foreign affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, at a September 2016 United Nations meeting said his country regarded drug trafficking \"as a most serious crime,\" and that the death penalty kept major drug syndicates away from Singapore.\nSingapore had\u00a0eight executions for drugs\u00a0from 2015 to 2017, according to a March 2018 report from Harm Reduction International.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmerican application\nDrug policy and law experts said attempts at similar laws in the United States would face\u00a0constitutional obstacles.\nThey pointed to a high bar for the death penalty established in the\u00a02008 U.S. Supreme Court case\u00a0Kennedy vs. Louisiana, which addressed whether states violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment by imposing the death sentence for the crime of child rape.\u00a0The court\u2019s opinion said\u00a0\"the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim\u2019s life was not taken.\"\nHowever, the court said its concern was limited to crimes against individual persons and did not address offenses against the State, such as treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity.\u00a0Congress in 1994 enacted a law allowing the imposition of the death penalty for drug kingpins even if no death occurred.\n\"If the death penalty is unconstitutional to impose against a child rapist, it is hard to imagine a court upholding its imposition against a person for selling drugs,\" said Alex Kreit, a law professor and co-director of the Center for Criminal Law and Policy at Thomas Jefferson School of Law.\nExperts also questioned how effective the death penalty would be as a deterrent for drug offenders.\n\"The likelihood of getting caught, prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to death \u2014 especially at the federal level with only three executions since 1964 \u2014 is tiny,\" said Matthew Robinson, a professor of criminal justice at Appalachian State University.\nOur ruling\nTrump said China and Singapore impose the death penalty on drug dealers.\nChinese law says that individuals who smuggle, traffic, transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions can receive a death sentence. Singapore\u2019s Misuse of Drugs Act also calls for the death penalty for individuals convicted of trafficking specified amounts of opium, cocaine, cannabis, and other substances.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim True.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-14 15:24:27 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  Says China and Singapore impose the death penalty on drug dealers.
