Now it\u2019s $10,000 a month.\"", "truth_label": "mostly-true", "date": "stated on October 2, 2015 in an episode of HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher\":", "title": "Bill Maher: Cancer drugs cost $10,000 a month", "text": "Patients used to pay $10,000 a year for cancer drugs, but now they\u2019re paying $10,000 a month, according to HBO talk show host Bill Maher.\nThat\u2019s a message circulating on Facebook recently, promoted by the\u00a0\"Bill Maher Fanpage.\" A reader asked us to check it out.\nThe quote comes from the Oct. 2 episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, where Maher discussed Turing Pharmaceuticals, the company that jacked up the cost of a life-saving drug from $13.50 to $750 essentially overnight.\n\"Not that (Turing CEO Martin) Shkreli is unusual for the pharmaceutical industry,\" Maher said on his show. \"Fifteen\u00a0years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it\u2019s $10,000 a month because this cartel owns the U.S. government every bit as much as Mexican drug lords own theirs.\"\nIt\u2019s well known that the cost of health care is on the rise,\u00a0but has the annual cost of cancer drugs really increased so dramatically in just a decade and a half?\nMaher\u2019s team sent us links to some news articles about the rising cost of cancer drugs, and we tracked down information that speaks to his claim.\nThe best information we could nail down is the cost of anticancer drugs at launch,\u00a0the initial price when the Federal Drug Administration approves a drug.\nThese are the sticker prices set by the pharmaceutical companies, not the prices patients actually pay out of pocket, which are reduced by insurance payments, patient assistance programs and other discounts. Costs increases, though, are often passed on to consumers.\nMaher has a point that cancer drug costs are on the rise. We charted the launch costs of cancer drugs the FDA approved since 1999, using a list compiled by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nThe second half of Maher\u2019s statement -- that cancer drugs now cost about $10,000 a month -- is also on solid ground. Of drugs approved in 2015, the monthly average cost is $11,319. And experts in the field often cite that $10,000 figure themselves.\nBecause many cancer drugs are not administered to patients for a full year, it\u2019s difficult to determine an average annual cost, so the first half of Maher\u2019s statement -- that they cost about $10,000 a year 15 years ago -- is hard to nail down. To his point, though, the monthly cost of a new drug was dramatically lower in 2000 than what it is now at about $4,634.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the news articles that Maher\u2019s team sent us is an academic article in the Journal of Oncology Practice that supports his statement. The report reads, \"The average cancer drug price for approximately one year of therapy or a total treatment duration was less than $10,000 before 2000.\"\nMaher\u2019s statement is \"in the ballpark,\" if not an understatement, said Rena Conti, a health economist at the University of Chicago who researches cancer drug prices.\nIn a 2015 paper Conti authored with three other leading health economists, she examined the launch cost of anticancer drugs controlled for inflation and the benefit to the patient (how much it prolongs life expectancy). For example, in 1995, anticancer drugs cost $54,100 for an additional year of life, the study found. In 2005, drugs cost $139,100 for the same benefit, and the price grew to $207,000 in 2013.\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical companies set their own drug prices. What\u2019s pushing them to increase the costs?\nIt\u2019s not necessarily that cancer drugs are getting better and are thus worth more. Conti\u2019s research concluded that just about one-fifth of the cancer drug cost increase can be attributed to a better product.\nThere are two primary forces behind annual cancer drug cost increases, Conti said: First, pharmaceutical companies estimate a \"zone of indifference\" -- based on last year\u2019s prices, how much more would buyers be willing to pay? Second, rebates and discounts for drugs have also increased over time, and this creates an incentive for drug companies to increase their costs alongside the discounts.\nPharmaceutical companies defend drug price increases by emphasizing that the revenue funds innovative research and that drugs lower overall health care costs by treating illnesses.\nBecause there\u2019s no formal price regulation and competition in the industry is rare, \"It really is a system where there\u2019s no downward pressure on drug prices,\" said Peter Bach, director of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center for Health Policy and Outcomes in an interview with Fortune.\nOur ruling\nMaher said, \"15 years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it\u2019s $10,000 a month.\"\nThe average annual cost of a drug isn\u2019t easy to calculate, given the way cancer drugs are scheduled; many drugs aren\u2019t used every month for an entire year. So the first half of the statement is hard to verify,\u00a0though we did find one academic source that cites a similar figure.\nHowever, Maher has a point that the cost of cancer drugs has increased dramatically since 2000, when the average monthly price of a cancer drug, when it first hit the market, was about $4,600. In 2015, the monthly cost is over $10,000.\nMaher\u2019s numbers are a little squishy, but they\u2019re in the ballpark. We rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05659"}
