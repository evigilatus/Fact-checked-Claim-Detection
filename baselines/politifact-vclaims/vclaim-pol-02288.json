(But as our friends at Snopes point out, this choice is a somewhat ironic considering FIGG\u2019s CEO is a woman.)\nA visit to MCM\u2019s homepage clearly shows the company is not staffed exclusively by women \u2014 not by a long shot. In fact, the MCM website page that features key personnel does not include a single woman.\nAccording to MCM\u2019s website, the company is fully owned and managed by five brothers: Raul Munilla, Juan Munilla, Jorge Munilla, Lou Munilla, Fernando Munilla and Pedro Munilla (seen below, from left to right).\n\nAs for MCM\u2019s vice president? Its manager of general construction? Or its regional operations director for Texas? All men, too.\n\"Although the company has several women in very responsible roles, the ownership is made up of the Munilla brothers and their families,\" said Donald Silver, a spokesman for MCM. \"It is so unfortunate that some junk news sites chose to carry unsubstantiated stories that were false and hurtful.\"\nTo bolster the flimsy case against women construction workers, the Squawker article places great weight on an interview between an MCM employee and her alma mater, Florida International University.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeonor Flores, a project executive at MCM and a 1998 graduation of FIU, was interviewed for an article that would appear on FIU\u2019s website about the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge.\n\"It\u2019s very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter, because I think women have a different perspective. We\u2019re able to put in an artistic touch and we\u2019re able to build, too,\" Flores told FIU in an article that ran March 3, less than two weeks before the March 15 bridge collapse.\nThe Squawker article pointed to Flores\u2019 quote as proof that MCM had allowed senior-ranking female employees to prioritize aesthetics over safety. The Squawker article characterizes Flores\u2019 quote as follows:\n\"Leonor Flores, FIU alumna, and MCM project exec says her number one priority when building bridges is to make sure they look pretty. Nothing else matters.\"\nBut let\u2019s set to one side this rather extreme reading of Flores\u2019 quote. An update to the FIU article issued a day after the bridge collapse clarified that \"Leonor Flores did not work on the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge project in any capacity.\"\nSilver, the MCM spokesman, confirmed Flores was not the project manager on the FIU pedestrian bridge construction project.\nOur ruling\nA video blogger said an all-female construction company built the Florida bridge that collapsed.\nOne of the two companies responsible for building the bridge \u2014 and the focus of the conspiracy theory \u2014 is MCM, which is owned and managed by five brothers. MCM\u2019s vice president, manager of general construction and its Texas operations director are all men. In fact, the MCM website page that features key personnel does not include a single woman.\nFurthermore, Leonor Flores, a project executive at MCM, who has figured into the conspiracy theory as something of a scapegoat, had no involvement in FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge, according to her alma mater FIU.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02288"}
