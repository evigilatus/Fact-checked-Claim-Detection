The Republicans in the Horsemen Bay have indicated that legislation providing for such a change involves the costs of seeking elections by universal suffrage open to all members of the cooperative. Fraser told the Senate Committee on Business and Commerce on April 19, \"If you're a person who lives, let's say, in Marple Falls and wants to run, you have to... seek the support of 210,000 people, perhaps more than $300,000 to run for a cooperative board of directors, which is somewhat ridiculous.\" Ka-ching. Did he claim money? In an interview, Fraser noted that each of the seven directors in Piednall was elected by the more than 200,000 members of the Cooperative, and deployed in 24 provinces. In contrast, members of the Texas House represent approximately 139,000 residents each. Frasier told us that his cost estimates assumed that the board candidate would send at least one post to each board member, at a cost of at least one dollar per recipient, so the one collective mail would cost over $200,000. The candidates also spent money on such things as websites. But what do campaign reports show for Piednals candidates? It turns out there's nothing. The State does not require this because the cooperative is not a governmental entity. For his part, Fraser referred to the estimated expenditure on the Texas House campaign, which indicated that in October 2010, the lowest cost-effective campaign had cost about $296,000. The most expensive campaign -- which did not end in victory -- cost more than $1.2 million. Fraser painted expenditure figures from a Texas Tribune chart published in November. The graph was limited to candidates in competing races, bringing the total expenditure from July 2009 to 23 October 2010 - thereby reducing the value of candidates likely to be spent during the November general elections. According to the graph, Raoul Torres, a Republican in Nois County, spent $296,284 until 23 October on his way to victory, while the Democratic Party Patrick Rose of Dreping Springs spent $1.2 million trying to re-elect him. Using the same graph, we later identified more than 50 winners in the House of Representatives who had spent less than Torres on 23 October, although many of the nicest spenders faced a united third party alone. After her re-election by the Republican Party Susan King, on her way to the best liberals and independents, she spent the least: $30.995. Among the victors of major opposition parties, the Republicans, John F. Garza, who released the Democratic Republic, David Lebowitz, spent $72,583. When we inquired about the cost of previous Council campaigns, Council spokesman Anne Harvey encouraged us to contact the candidates directly. We sent or left telephone messages with 13 candidates for two seats on the Council last year, asking them how much they spent on what. Of the defeated, Ken Rigsby Side spent $2,700 of his own money wandering around, Dan Pederson said he spent about $1,000 on yard signs, shirts and ads, and Ted Lehr said he spent less than $500. In the low end, Thornton Kell said he spent a small amount to buy a list of cooperative members. Jeffrey Vanderball and Bob Driscoll said he didn't spend any money. More details from the loss of candidates: -- Steven Carrecker said he spent almost $2,000 exclusively on newspaper ads. He also said that his support group, Clean Water, had sent 4,000 postcards, which might cost $2,000. David Foster, Director of the State Programme for Clean Water Action in Texas, told us in an interview that the group spent $15,000 on postcards containing the names of its preferred candidates who had been mailed to 7,000 group members in the cooperative service area. It also reaches members electronically and telephonely. Carreker said that he did not believe that the transition to 30,000 resident districts, as Frasier suggests, would change significantly: \"I realize (because of direct experience) the enormous task of successfully communicating with 200,000 other members, but it is difficult to communicate with even seven of these numbers.\" - Joe Sumi said: \"I had a little money, less than $3,000 and had to rely on volunteers and the word mouth.\" As for Frasier's figure of $300,000, he said, \"I have no way of confirming this figure.\" The e-mail of Sumi continued: \"Anyway, unless the candidate has the support of special interest groups and/or political parties, the joint candidate does not have a great chance of winning... especially when only 10-12% of the members (participation) vote. In the 2010 races, 20,727 members of the Cooperative voted, according to the results announced by the Cooperative at the Council meeting on 28 June. \"PEC area over 8,000 square miles. Five of the six candidates have won the election since 2009 \"because they have received the support of various special interest groups\" which \"wanted to maintain public order because any candidate with their support has a tremendous advantage,\" said Smee. The system has now been established to maintain a certain elite in power. With regard to successful candidates: Chris Perry, who had won the seat in District 4, said that he had spent less than $1,000 on his own funds, mostly for a website, leaflets and travel. He did not request or accept contributions, but he made declarations \"from a variety of individuals and organizations, but I have no idea what they spent or did to support me, other than notify their friends or members of their support.\" Perry said, \"I don't know anyone who would\" spend $300,000 plus. It's gonna be a lot of money to spend on a cooperative board election. Ross Fisher, who won the 5th region race, said that he spent about $4,200, or less than $1 per one of the 4,824 votes he drew \"to communicate directly with the PEC voters in order to overcome a coordinated effort to control\" the Council. In his e-mail, Fraser said, \"It's true that it's hard to reach all P.C. voters. The candidate must be willing to spend money to compete with private interests that wish to raise rates to finance an environmental agenda. The single-member regions will make it financially possible for a middle-wage drawer to be nominated for membership of the PEC Council, and will increase useful communication between the members and their Council.\" Both Fisher and Sumi referred to a letter from 15 February to the members of the PEC4U Steering Committee, which described the composition of the group four and a half years ago as an \"unconnected organization and web site,\" which initially wanted \"their primary motivation\" to \"congratize the community to reduce the use of fossil fuels and to make renewable energy and conservation programmes available to all members of the group. We soon learned that there will be no real change without fundamental changes in the governance of the Economic and Social Council and the Governing Council elections process.\" The letter also expresses its pride in appointing the group and supporting the candidates in the last three council elections. \"You're all the directors we agreed to and helped us get an election,\" says the letter. \"We feel that our close relationship with the press, as well as with Action for Clean Water and the Public Citizen, played a key role in those elections.\" In the Texas Public Citizen &apos; s Office, researcher/organizer Andy Wilson told us that this group does not support candidates for the Council of Pedrenales but encourages voters to participate. Wilson said that he had taken no position on whether the members of the cooperative should elect the council from the single-member provinces. After that, we asked PEC4U members about their expenditures. They replied that the group had never had a political record and had not made any candidate contributions or campaign-related expenditures. \"We don't have deep pockets hidden and didn't spend money on campaigns,\" said Committee member Sue Barnett. However, members of the steering committee, John Watson, said the group \"involved in e-mail, communication and personal contact\" with members of the cooperative. Councilman Bill Christensen said: \"Though some individuals have spent a few dollars here and there to make copies like this, PEC4U itself does not spend any money - it does not even have a bank account or any legal status. It's a very loose organization.\" Member Rick Sterenberg said: \"My expenditures from my own funds have amounted to about $30 per year for Internet domain renewal fees since 2006 or 2007. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ I think we've also donated some stickers, ink and paper to our printer.\" Conclusion: Of the 10 candidates who responded to our query, only one said that he had spent more than $4,000; others said that they had spent from zero to $3,000. We went back to Fraser, who told him the original \"indirect observation\" reflected what a normal resident would cost to defeat an enemy supported by PEC4U and clean water work, which, along with the general citizen, called \"the machine.\" Fraser pointed out that Fisher was the only one who had succeeded in such a candidate since the groups began to influence the cooperative elections: \"I'm not sure if it's $300,000, $50,000 or $1.2 million... Under any scenario, if you're going to call 210,000 people, it's expensive.\" Our final analysis of Frasier's cost announcement: Get out. We see no reason why any Texas House race should be used as a guide to estimate the cost of searching for the seat of the Governing Council. And the answers we got from most of the candidates last year indicate that there's no basis for linking the costs of such campaigns anywhere near $300,000, which is more than 60 times -- 60 times -- more than anyone told us that he spent it. The statement is very inaccurate, he smokes. Pants on fire. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 January 12, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13168"}
