(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe tweet is by Randy Bryce, whose Twitter handle is @IronStache.\u00a0He is a U.S. Army veteran who ran as a Democrat for Wisconsin\u2019s 1st congressional district. It has been shared on Twitter more than 22,000 times and more than 500 people replied to it, including some who said that it\u2019s not a Sinclair Lewis quote.\nWe reached out to Working Families, a political group where Bryce is a senior advisor, according to his Twitter bio, to ask about the quote. A spokesman for the organization said in an email that \"it turns out Sinclair Lewis never wrote those exact words, though they\u2019re commonly attributed to him.\"\nBryce updated his Twitter acknowledging that it\u2019s not a Sinclair Lewis quote, the spokesman said. When we checked Bryce\u2019s account on March 12, the tweet was still pinned to his page. But he had also tweeted excerpts from the Sinclair Lewis Society at Illinois State University, which notes on its website that though the quote sounds like something Lewis might have said or written, the society has never been able to find the exact quote.\nWhether Lewis said the quote about fascism is the society\u2019s \"most asked question,\" according to its website. The society also lists passages from two novels he wrote that are similar to the quote attributed to him.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \"It Can\u2019t Happen Here,\" he writes: \"But he saw too that in America the struggle was befogged by the fact that the worst fascists were they who disowned the word \u2018fascism\u2019 and preached enslavement to capitalism under the style of constitutional and traditional Native American liberty.\"\nIn \"Gideon Planish,\" he writes: \"I just wish people wouldn\u2019t quote Lincoln or the Bible, or hang out the flag or the cross, to cover up something that belongs more to the bank-book and the three golden balls.\"\n\"There was also a play by Sherman Yellen called \u2018Strangers\u2019 in the late 1970s which had a similar quote, but no one, including one of Lewis\u2019s biographers, Richard Lingeman, has ever been able to locate the original citation,\" according to the society.\nIn 2007, Harvard Magazine published a plea from a reader who sought \"the definitive source\" of the quote, which he said was \"attributed variously to Upton Sinclair, H.L. Mencken, and Huey Long, and to Sinclair Lewis\u2019 \u2018It Can\u2019t Happen Here.\u2019\"\nBut the reader said online searches of the novel didn\u2019t reveal the quote, and when we searched the book for the quote on Google Books, we couldn\u2019t find it either.\nWe emailed Harvard Magazine to find out if the publication has discovered the quote\u2019s origins in the years since that reader\u2019s request, but senior editor Jean Ann Martin said, \"sadly, we have not located a definitive source to date.\"\nCertainly, many people have attributed the quote to Lewis\u2014not just Randy Bryce or the Facebook poster. Lewis has \"long been quoted erroneously,\" according to a Nov. 6 Talking Points Memo story. It\u2019s been pinned to other people, too. On Goodreads, the quote is attributed to James Waterman Wise.\nBut lacking a credible, solid source for the quote, we won\u2019t attribute it to anyone. We rate this Facebook post False.\n Share the Facts 2019-03-12 18:54:24 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Sinclair Lewis said, \"When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.\"    Viral image On the internet     Tuesday, March 5, 2019 2019-03-05    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00908"}
