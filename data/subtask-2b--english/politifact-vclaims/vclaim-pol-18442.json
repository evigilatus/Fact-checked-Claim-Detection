What\u2019s going on here?\" Twitter attached a warning to the tweet that: \"some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process.\"\nThere is no evidence that the person was wrongly handling the ballots.

The election\u00a0worker was transporting the ballots to the Convention Center where they are being processed.\n\"It was full, and he brought it into (the) convention center where it was secured,\" Feeley said. \"Despite the allegation that he was some civilian walking off with the box, he is a city employee.\"\nPennsylvania continued to count ballots the morning after Election Day.
