Ucci says requiring banks to have outside security cameras would deter robberies", "text": "On the morning of Sept. 20, 2010, \u00a0a 49-year-old service station manager brought a deposit bag with $12,542 to a Citizen Bank branch in Woonsocket. A man in a ski mask confronted him outside the bank and demanded the money.\n\nWhen David Main tried to run away, the robber fatally shot him outside the bank entrance and ran off. Three accomplices have since been indicted for the crime.\n\nNow state Rep. Stephen Ucci is sponsoring legislation that would require all banks to \"maintain security video cameras covering all customer doors, automatic teller machines, and night deposit repositories.\"\n\n\"If that bank had been required to install security cameras outside of its building years ago, the victim may still be alive today,\" Ucci said in a statement. \"A robber\u2019s primary goal is to get in and out of the bank or ATM as quickly as possible without being recognized. A surveillance camera capturing a criminal\u2019s face and other identifiable traits would certainly discourage robbery attempts and serve as a deterrent to robbers.\"\n\nThe killing of Main, a father and husband, provoked outrage and calls for the death penalty.\n\nUcci told us he submitted his legislation after talking to Main\u2019s employer, who told him about the killing. He said the police did not ask him to pursue the bill and that he did not research the subject.\n\nWhile we understand his motivation, we wondered: does video surveillance deter robberies at banks?\n\nWe often see surveillance images of robbers -- some disguised, some not -- who clearly were not deterred by cameras prominently placed in banks.\n\nSo we searched for some evidence.\n\nFor starters, we learned that nationwide, 5,628 bank robberies (including a very small number of larcenies and burglaries) were reported in 2010 to the FBI. Loot was taken more than 90 percent of the time. The crimes resulted in 106 injuries and 16 deaths.\n\nOf the banks that were targeted in these cases, 5,543, or 98 percent, had some form of video surveillance.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a few robbers unfazed by video surveillance. Did plenty of others refrain from robbing banks because of video cameras? No study shows that, as far as we know.\n\nWe did find one enlightening report, written by Deborah Lamm Weisel, director of police research in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at North Carolina State University. Her 2007 text on bank robbery was created for the non-profit Center for Problem-Oriented Policing and appears on the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s web site.\n\nWeisel notes that the number of incidences has increased dramatically since the 1960s, as banks expanded hours and branches.\n\n\"Bank robberies are usually fast, low-risk crimes, because employees are trained to comply with a robber\u2019s demands,\" she writes.\n\nWhen listing measures that heighten a robber\u2019s \"perception of risk,\" she mentions hiring security guards, assigning employees to greet customers and enforcing policies prohibiting caps and sunglasses inside the bank. She did not include electronic surveillance.\n\n\"Cameras do not appear to reduce robberies. Many bank robbers are not deterred because they simply do not believe they will be caught. Others believe that cameras can be thwarted with a disguise or by covert behavior or that cameras can be disabled such as with spray paint; or they simply do not think about cameras at all,\" Weisel writes.\n\nSurveillance, she said, helps \u00a0\"in identifying and apprehending suspects and can aid in prosecution as well. \"\n\nDouglas Johnson, vice president of risk management policy at the American Bankers Association, agreed.\n\n\"I\u2019ve always heard and believed that cameras are not a deterrent measure. Cameras and video are there specifically for apprehension purposes,\" he said.\n\nCameras are already at all ATMs, he noted, and do not prevent ATM crime. \u00a0\n\nWilliam Farrell, legislative council to the Rhode Island Bankers Association, testified against \u00a0Ucci\u2019s bill at the State House because of civil liberty concerns and other issues. When interviewed, he said that industry experts don\u2019t view surveillance as an \"effective tool in terms of deterrence.\"\n\nWe did find a 2009 article, in which representatives of The Security Executive Council, a risk mitigation research and services organization, wrote that \"parking lot cameras \u2026 could help identify perpetrators before they put their masks on. They could also act as a deterrent.\" But the authors emphasize apprehension, adding only that such video surveillance \"could also\" serve as a deterrent.\n\nWhen we told Ucci our findings, he said his intent was not just to prevent robberies of banks, but of customers, too. Exterior surveillance could deter robbers from attacking customers outside, he said, as well as provide information about a robber\u2019s identity and getaway.\n\nUcci, no doubt, sincerely wants to prevent another tragic death like David Main\u2019s. And police officials in Providence and Woonsocket told us that video surveillance certainly helps catch and send robbers to prison, preventing repeat offenders from robbing again.\n\nBut we couldn\u2019t find any evidence that outdoor surveillance deters robberies of customers.\nAnd the experts we consulted doubt its deterrence value.\n\nWe rate Ucci\u2019s claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: The initial version of this item incorrectly reported the amount of money stolen in the 2010 robbery outside a bank.
