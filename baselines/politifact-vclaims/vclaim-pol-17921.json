But some conservative commentators say not all the money is going toward the cause.\nIn a since-deleted June 11 Facebook post (archived here), Ryan Fournier, co-founder of Students for Trump, claimed that donations to Black Lives Matter were actually being funneled to Democratic campaigns.\n\"All money donated to Black Lives Matter goes directly to ActBlue, a Democrat Super PAC that then feeds the money to Democrat candidates,\" he said. \"Congratulations, you played yourself.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fournier deleted the post after we reached out to him, but the Twitter version remained posted.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nOther conservative commentators, such as Candace Owens and the Hodgetwins, Instagram posts have made similar allegations. So we looked into them.\nThe post is inaccurate. ActBlue is a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and other causes like Black Lives Matter. It passes along donations to organizations that use its fundraising platform \u2014\u00a0it doesn\u2019t pocket the money itself.\u00a0\nClaim came from Instagram story\nWe reached out to Fournier for the source of his claim and haven\u2019t heard back. His assertion appears to stem from a video circulating on social media.\u00a0\nThe video shows a screen recording of an Instagram story from a user in Miami. He attributed the information to a conservative Instagram account called \"Telerevela,\" which started posting in February and publishes conspiratorial posts about the coronavirus pandemic and protests over police brutality in Spanish. Telerevela posted an identical video, albeit in Spanish, on Facebook around 1 a.m. on June 11.\nThe video, which has nearly 2 million views on Twitter, lays out a false trail for Black Lives Matter donations.\nIn it, the user tries to donate to Black Lives Matter. When they tap the donate button on the movement\u2019s website, they\u2019re directed to a web address that has ActBlue in it. The donation page also has a disclosure about the nonprofit.\n\n(Screenshot from Twitter)\nThen, they open up a page from OpenSecrets.org \u2014 the website of the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics \u2014 to see how ActBlue spends its money. They highlight what appear to be several multi-million dollar contributions to Democratic presidential candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\"And that my fellow Americans is how \u2018white collar\u2019 money laundering is done,\" reads some text at the end of the video. \"BLM is just another corrupt arm of the (Democratic National Committee).\"\nThe video misrepresents what ActBlue does, as well as where donations to Black Lives Matter actually go.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo misrepresents ActBlue platform\nBlack Lives Matter is using ActBlue\u2019s fundraising platform to take donations. But ActBlue isn\u2019t pocketing the money.\nActBlue told us in an email that it passes along contributions from its fundraising platform directly to the 501(c)(3) charities or 501(c)(4) nonprofits that asked for them. Its function is similar to PayPal or Stripe, which are conduits for online purchases.\nOpenSecrets also clarified that point in a tweeted response to Candace Owens\u2019 post, saying that \"a donation to BLM through ActBlue goes just to BLM, not any other group.\"\nActBlue is a fundraising platform used by Democrats & progressives. Like WinRed on the right, many candidates use it to process donations but that money isn't pooled to be shared across candidates or groups. A donation to BLM through ActBlue goes just to BLM, not any other group. https://t.co/rb5sF7VbwA\u2014 OpenSecrets.org (@OpenSecretsDC) June 11, 2020 \nOpenSecrets compared ActBlue with WinRed, a fundraising platform for Republican campaigns and causes that was launched in 2019 to compete with ActBlue. Both organizations facilitate fundraising for aligned political groups.\nDespite being classified as political action committees by the Federal Election Commission, ActBlue and WinRed have \"non-contribution accounts,\" meaning they have separate bank accounts that \"will not be used to make contributions, whether direct, in-kind or via coordinated communications, or coordinated expenditures, to federal candidates or committees,\" according to the FEC.\nDemocratic and Republican presidential candidates are listed as \"top vendors/recipients\" on ActBlue and WinRed\u2019s OpenSecrets pages not because the organizations have directly donated to them, but rather because the organizations act as \"middle men\" between the donors and the candidates.\nFor example, if you were to go to Biden\u2019s donation page, you would be redirected to a page on ActBlue\u2019s fundraising platform to complete the transaction. Similarly, if you tried to donate to President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, you\u2019d be redirected to a page from WinRed.\u00a0\nRELATED:\u00a0\u2018Defund the police\u2019 movement: What do activists mean by that?\nAs the Center for Public Integrity reported when WinRed was launched, the idea is to make it easier for political campaigns to fundraise small-dollar donations.\n\"Take the 2018 midterm elections, when Democratic House and Senate candidates outraised Republicans more than two to one in contributions from individuals,\" the center wrote. \"Republicans pointed to ActBlue, which helps donors more easily give money to Democratic candidates and liberal political groups, as a big reason why.\"\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc., the organization\u00a0that operates\u00a0the Black Lives Matter website, is fiscally sponsored by the nonprofit Thousand Currents. That means Thousand Currents\u00a0is handling\u00a0Black Lives Matter\u2019s finances as the organization seeks its own tax-exempt status. The Internal Revenue Service\u00a0stipulates\u00a0that 501(c)(3) organizations are \"absolutely prohibited\" from making contributions to political campaigns, which would apply to Thousand Currents.\nOur ruling\nA popular claim on social media asserts that donations to Black Lives Matter go directly to ActBlue, which uses them to fund Democratic campaigns.\nIt\u2019s wrong. ActBlue is a nonprofit technology organization that provides a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and causes. Black Lives Matter and Democratic presidential candidates use the platform to fundraise.\nActBlue does not pocket donations that are facilitated by its platform \u2014\u00a0it routes donations to organizations in a similar way to the Republican fundraising platform WinRed.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.\nCorrection, June 16, 2020: A previous version of this article stated that\u00a0the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. is a nonprofit. In fact, it is in a fiscal sponsorship with a nonprofit. It is not yet its own\u00a0501(c)(3) organization.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17921"}
