Rob Portman says hundreds of tax preferences and loopholes have been added since 1986", "text": "The only things certain in life are death, taxes, and Rob Portman\u2019s interest is in the latter. The first-term Ohio U.S. senator is, after all, a former budget director in President George W. Bush\u2019s cabinet, and tax reform is one of his foremost goals.\n\nJust which tax rates and preferences need reforming is a political judgment. But the scope of the challenge caught our attention when Portman told the Fox Business Networkon Feb. 20:\n\n\"There have been literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986, last time we did this.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of new references and loopholes, and we were curious about the number. So we asked Portman\u2019s press secretary, Caitlin Dunn, who sent us two sources to support the senator\u2019s claim.\n\nFirst was an August 2010 report to the White House by President Barack Obama\u2019s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, which laid out a menu of optionsfor simplification and better compliance within the tax system. The board included leaders in economics, business and labor and was chaired by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Like Portman, this committee cited 1986 as a baseline, because that was the last time Congress overhauled the nation\u2019s tax code.\n\nAmong the committee\u2019s observations: \"The tax code has become more complex and more unstable over the last two decades, in part because legislators have increasingly used targeted tax provisions to achieve social policy objectives normally achieved by spending programs. There have been more than 15,000 changes to the tax code since 1986, and a current JCT (Joint Committee on Taxation) pamphlet lists 42 pages of expiring provisions.\"\n\nThat 15,000 figure was also in the second source that Dunn sent us: a statement from a 2010 Senate hearing, by Sen.Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said, \"We have made 15,000 changes to the tax code since 1986, but many of these changes have stretched the code in different directions.\"\n\nIf you read these statements closely, you\u2019ll notice that they don\u2019t say exactly the same thing as Portman said. These statements talk about thousands of changes -- but a change can mean many things, including revocation of tax breaks, new rates, a reinterpretation of a rule or even a technical correction, according to a number of budget experts with whom we spoke. Affirming this was Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago and the staff director of the President\u2019s Economic Advisory Board in 2010 -- that is, the Volcker committee whose report was cited as a source by Portman\u2019s office for the 15,000 \"changes\" in the tax code.\n\n\"Definitely those are not all loopholes,\" Goolsbee told us in an email. \"That would include every change to the code.\"\n\nSo how many of them were new loopholes or preferences?\n\nWe called Tax Analysts, a Northern Virginia publisher of in-depth analyses of tax law, and asked Martin Sullivan, the chief economist.\n\nSullivan used to work for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. He was somewhat skeptical of broad claims on numbers in these matters. For example, if an existing law is changed and it results in a single section being split into a dozen or more parts -- but with provisions that already existed -- do you count that as a dozen new provisions?\n\nHe recalled counting the changes in a single tax law in 1997 -- 400 of them, he says. He says many of them resulted in tax cuts. But that does not mean they were all loopholes or special provisions. Four-hundred new loopholes in a single year would, in fact, be eye-popping.\n\nContinuing our quest for a number, we turned to congressional testimony from hearings on the need for tax reform, and found the prepared text for a March, 2011 Senate hearing by Fred T. Goldberg Jr., who co-heads the tax group at the Washington law firm Skadden Arps. Goldberg is a former IRS commissioner, former IRS chief counsel, and former assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy.\n\nIn his written statement, he referred to the \"endless stream\" of bills that followed the 1986 tax reform, and the \"mind-numbing complexity\" of the tax code that only grew worse. \u00a0\n\nIn other words, tax preferences grew. But this still did not give us a number.\n\nSo we talked with Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute and its Tax Policy Center. A former deputy assistant director for tax policy at the Congressional Budget Office, Williams said there has definitely been an expansion of the tax code, in many cases promoting policy makers\u2019 social and economic goals such as education (with tax credits), work (the earned income tax credit), retirement security (individuual retirement account changes) and so on.\n\nStir in corporate tax provisions and the number adds up.\n\nDoes it add up to hundreds?\n\n\"I certainly haven\u2019t counted,\" Williams said.\n\nAs we continued down this road, the question took on the characteristics of a puzzle, if not a chase down a rabbit hole. Portman\u2019s claim rang true, but no one had a precise way of measuring the number. Several experts, however, introduced us to the closest thing: The annual lists of \"tax expenditures\" published by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and, separately, the White House in its annual budget documents.\n\nA tax expenditure is a tax break, credit, deduction, exclusion or exemption granted for a specific purpose -- to spur energy production or education or employment, for example, or to exempt interest on certain construction bonds from taxes, or to provide special depreciation allowances for ethanol production plants. Some people call these loopholes, although every one of them is allowed for in the tax code, and they certainly qualify under Portman\u2019s characterization of \"tax preferences.\"\n\nThis gave us a benchmark. And in 2006, the Congressional Research Service, or CRS, said in a report that there were 133 of these tax expenditures as of 1987, the year following tax reform. The CRS prepares research reports to help lawmakers understand the history and background of particular issues.\n\nHave tax expenditures, or special provisions, grown by the hundreds since then?\n\nNot if you use the number on a CRS report last March 22, which said that there were now \"over 200\" separate tax expenditures. And that figure of \"over 200\" differed with one the White House used, compiled by the Treasury Department for inclusion in President Barack Obama\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget request. That document listed, item by item, 188 -- everything from expensing of certain small business investments to income averaging for farmers.\n\nProviding us with a slightly different number was Leonard Burman, a professor and economist at Syracuse University and former deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax analysis. Burman sent us a chart based on information from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It showed there were 202 tax expenditures in 2007. Since there were 133 right after tax reform, that would not suggest growth by the hundreds.\n\nBurman concluded that Portman was \"exaggerating a bit,\" but he added that Portman\u2019s \"basic point was right -- there has been a proliferation of tax preferences.\"\n\nIt was beginning to look as if Portman might be wrong. But in all these discussions was a caveat: The lists of tax expenditures are incomplete and imperfect. We\u2019ve noted already that the White House lists and joint tax committee lists don\u2019t align, for various technical and interpretive reasons.\n\nBut more importantly, the lists are nothing more than reports of tax breaks in effect at a given \u00a0point in time. If a provision is changed but its structure remains the same or similar, it may not get counted as a new tax expenditure, even though the change could benefit someone new or restrict someone else.\n\nSuch problems were pointed out to us by Alex Brill, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Brill served as an adviser on Obama\u2019s fiscal commission in 2010, and was an economist for President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers in 2001 and 2002. More pertinent for today\u2019s purposes, he was policy director and chief economist on the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee -- the committee that writes the tax laws -- -- from 2002 to 2007.\n\nBrill told us, \"There is no single, absolute, universal means with which to count.\"\n\nBrill sent us the prepared testimony from September 22, 2011, of \u00a0Thomas A. Barthold, chief of staff the Joint Committee on Taxation, before the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.\nIn his prepared remarks, Barthold included a graph of tax expenditures. It showed that in 1986, there were about 130 of them.\n\nThe number had hit 250 by 2009, dropping slightly in 2010. These were only tax expenditures that had a cumulative value of $50 million or more. But Barthold provided the committee with something better: a list of tax expenditures that have been added to the tax code since the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n\nWe counted them and got 157 -- still not in the hundreds when measuring expansion or changes.\n\nBrill, however, found a number of things missing from that list. \u00a0For example, the new medical device tax in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 and its exclusion of certain items was not listed, nor was a drug tax from the same bill, even though it excludes certain drugs -- a provision that could be considered a preference.\n\nBrill said he found at least four examples from health reform, \"and there are more from just that bill if you dig deeper.\"\n\nAlso missing from the list, he noticed, was the frequently criticized NASCAR tax break, a provision from the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 that allowed for accelerated depreciation of race tracks. That bill alone had \"tons of provisions\" that amounted to narrow tax breaks, Brill said.\n\nWe counted the breaks in that bill, using a Joint Committee on Taxation document listing the effects of each new provision on tax revenue in the 2004 act. We came up with 179.\n\nSo Portman, after all of this, appears to be correct: There have been \"literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986, last time we did this.\"\n\nExactly how many, no one knows. We even asked Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor, president emeritus of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and President Ronald Reagan\u2019s chief economic adviser from 1982 through 1984. Feldstein\u2019s name came up during conversations with others, partly because he, too, was on the Volcker committee whose 15,000 figure was cited by Portman\u2019s office.\n\nWhen we asked by email about those 15,000 changes and whether they included more than loopholes and preferences, Feldstein replied, \"I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t know. I believe that many were added in the Clinton administration as a way of achieving increased government spending through the tax code.\"\n\nThat may seem a bit political, but economists see tax expenditures just as Feldstein described: a way of achieving a goal without direct spending. They cost the government, regardless.\n\nWe are still without a precise count of the number of loopholes and preferences added after the 1986 tax reform. Brill, however, took a stab at it, telling us, \"Certainly it less than 15,000,\" but well more than the other numbers mentioned here.\n\nInitially, he guessed it might be 300, but after looking at just a couple of tax-related bills he concluded that \"I think its far, far more than that.\"\n\nSo we were able to find enough documentation to prove it, even though Portman used an educated guess, not a hard figure. We rate his statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09611"}
