Clarke, the outspoken former sheriff of Milwaukee County, says he is leaving Twitter. If that\u2019s true, he sure went out with a bang.\nClarke put the nation\u2019s coronavirus response on blast with a barrage of tweets on March 15, 2020, some of which were later removed by Twitter. Among them:\n\n\nHe urged people to \"go out into the streets\" and demand that schools reopen and government stop exerting such \"control over our lives.\"\n\n\nHe said the coronavirus is \"an orchestrated attempt to destroy capitalism.\"\n\n\nHe insisted \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that George Soros, a prominent backer of liberal causes, is \"somewhere involved in this.\"\n\n\nWhew.\nThere\u2019s plenty of potential Pants on Fire ratings to be had from the Stetson-wearing controversy-magnet, but we\u2019re going to focus on a fourth, since-deleted tweet.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the full text (minus a few choice words):\n\"I am tired of all this, \u2018We have to err on the side of caution\u2019 (expletive). We have to get back to reasonableness dammit. It\u2019s the damn flu. Stop being afraid and start being sensible. Wash your (expletive) hands! Stop buying toilet paper. Do you (expletive) hear me????\"\nClarke stepped down as sheriff in 2017 after 15 years as the county\u2019s top cop, saying he was leaving to take a high-ranking post in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \u2014 a job that never materialized. In the time since, Clarke has also lost posts at a pro-President Trump super PAC and as a regular contributor on Fox News.\nNow he\u2019s using his free time to make the case everyone is being unreasonable because this is just \"the damn flu.\"\nLet\u2019s break it down.\nHow they\u2019re the same\nCoronavirus and the flu are both viruses, and experts say they have some shared characteristics:\nRisk factors \u2014 The groups of people at highest risk are similar, including the elderly.\nSpread \u2014 Both diseases spread from person to person through respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes (though it\u2019s possible coronavirus lingers in the air longer after the sick person has left).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention \u2014 The expert advice is similar: wash your hands, don\u2019t touch your face, stay away from people who are sick and stay home if you are sick.\nSymptoms \u2014 Both cause fever, cough, body aches and fatigue, though coronavirus is more likely to cause shortness of breath.\nTreatment \u2014 \u00a0Neither virus is treatable with antibiotics (those only work on bacterial infections).\nHow they\u2019re different\nThe diseases have some critical differences, most importantly the death rate and lack of a vaccine.\nBased on the current numbers, someone with COVID-19 \u2014 the disease caused by coronavirus \u2014 is 23 to 68 times more likely to die than someone who contracts the flu, based on the latest data from the World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nVaccine \u2014 A flu vaccine is available and effective to prevent the flu, or at least reduce its severity. A coronavirus vaccine is not yet available, and likely won\u2019t be for at least a year.\nTreatment \u2014 There are antiviral medications that address flu symptoms and can even shorten the duration of the illness, but such medications are still being tested for coronavirus.\nDeath rate \u2014 The fatality rate for this year\u2019s flu is estimated by the CDC\u00a0 at between 0.05% and 0.1% in the United States. The coronavirus fatality rate was estimated at 2.3% of those infected by China\u2019s CDC and 3.4% by the World Health Organization (though many expect that to fall to the 1-2% range once we know more about how many people have been infected).\nInfections \u2014 Coronavirus has, so far, infected far fewer people. There were about 3,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. when Clarke tweeted, compared to an estimated 36 million to 51 million flu illnesses this season.\nKnowledge and research \u2014 Scientists know much more about the flu, such as details on how it is transmitted, the range of symptoms and treatment. Such details on coronavirus remain a point of debate.\nAll this to say, the CDC and other health officials have made it clear coronavirus presents a litany of risks the standard flu does not. The overwhelmed health care systems in first China, then Italy reinforced the severity of the disease and the breadth of its potential impact here.\nAnd the reaction of government alone \u2014\u00a0closing schools, bars, restaurants and more \u2014\u00a0makes it clear there is a stark difference between the two.\nOur rating\nRanting against those who would \"err on the side of caution,\" Clarke claimed coronavirus is just the \"damn flu.\"\nThere is indeed overlap in some basic areas \u2014 what symptoms it causes, how it is spread, who is most at risk, etc. But those pale in light of the stark differences.\nThere is no vaccine for coronavirus. Treatment approaches are not as well established. And most critically, someone who contracts COVID-19 is at least 20 times more likely to die of the disease than someone with the flu, based on the best available data.\nThe overall theme from Clarke\u2019s tweetstorm was that the coronavirus is no big deal \u2014 that the disease is just the same old flu virus with a heaping spoonful of government overreach.\nThat flies in the face of lots of established science, as well as what nations like China and Italy have already experienced.\nWe rate Clarke\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18160"}
