But is it correct -- as Commerce Secretary\u00a0Penny Pritzker\u00a0wrote recently in Medium -- that since 2009, \"after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent\"?\nTo check Pritzker\u2019s statement, we looked at two economic statistics compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which, as it happens, is part of the department Pritzker oversees.\nOne is real disposable personal income -- that is, the accumulation of all personal incomes in the United States, minus taxes and adjusted for inflation.\nThat statistic rose from $10.9 trillion in 2009 to $12.2 trillion in 2015, the last full year available. That works out to an increase of 11.9 percent.\nHere\u2019s a summary graph:\n\nThat\u2019s lower than the 14 percent figure Pritzker cited, but it\u2019s still a double-digit increase over six years, so it\u2019s in the ballpark.\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from Pritzker\u2019s office, but Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said he suspects she arrived at her number through a different but reasonable calculation.\nHe said she was probably referring to a comparison of an average of the 12 monthly figures from 2009 and the three monthly figures (so far) for 2016. We double-checked Burtless\u2019 math and found that it works out to be a 13.7 percent increase -- on target with what Pritzker said.\nBut while Pritzker is either correct or reasonably close when looking at the overall personal income numbers, it\u2019s worth remembering that this number can be affected by population growth, even over a period as short as seven years.\nConsider an alternative measure -- real disposable personal income per capita, which is the previous statistic, but adjusted for the size of the U.S. population.\nThat measurement has gone up from $35,616 in 2009 to $38,046 in 2015 -- an increase of 6.8 percent. That\u2019s only half as fast as Pritzker said -- and it\u2019s worth remembering that this was a cumulative rise over six years. As a result, disposable personal income rose by only about 1 percent a year above inflation during that period.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound quite as exciting.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t this feel\u00a0right to most Americans?\nSo if Pritzker\u2019s claim about after-tax income growth is reasonably accurate, how does that jibe with equally accurate claims noting that \"Americans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years\"?\nFor starters, as we\u2019ve noted, there are various ways to measure income growth, each of them legitimate but some of them show different results.\n\"I agree that we want to think about some sort of per-person measure, but is the right measure per capita or per employed or per labor force participant?\" said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed.\nIn addition, even if real disposable personal income is going up over time, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s rising as fast as it once was. To measure this, we looked at the average annual increase in real disposable personal income during three recent periods.\nFrom 1992 to 2000, real disposable personal income rose an average of 3.7 percent per year. From 2001 to 2008, it rose an average of 2.7 percent per year. And from 2009 to 2015, it rose by 1.6 percent per year. That\u2019s a clear pattern of diminishing growth, even if it\u2019s still growth.\nBurtless noted that the lack of attention given to the role that rising population has warped perceptions of economic output and income growth.\nSpecifically, he said, the slowdown in population growth since the 1970s, especially in the age groups likeliest to be working, has made it harder for the United States to reach the once-common historical level of 3 percent annual economic growth.\nOur rating\nPritzker said that since 2009, \"after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent.\"\nUsing the most basic, aggregate measure, Pritzker is either on target or reasonably close. However, it\u2019s worth noting that this accomplishment is not quite as impressive once you strip out population growth or look at growth levels historically. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/adb03577-9123-471c-87e4-b3383d5fddcf", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04950"}
