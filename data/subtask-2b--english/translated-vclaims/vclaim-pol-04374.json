The 100-day Clinton web page on immigration doesn't mention amnesty at all. However, it promises \"a comprehensive migration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship within its first 100 days of office.\" This requires a series of steps before the migrant who is here illegally is eligible for citizenship. This won't be granted a pardon in 100 days. However, Clinton is in favour of giving many of these migrants the opportunity to remain in the United States and to be temporarily free from the risk of deportation. It supports two programs that give them \"delayed work\" by the Department of Homeland Security. The first is known as the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) (for deferred work for the arrival of children). It has been in force since 2012 and protects approximately 730,000 people who have come to the United States as children. The second, called DAPA (for deferred action for American parents and legal permanent residents), was proposed for 4 million people or so whose children are already American citizens or legitimate permanent residents. She's trying to keep families together. However, the Supreme Court of the United States has prevented its execution. These programmes are designed to provide temporary relief; qualified migrants must renew their appointment every few years. These persons are still considered to be illegal residents of the country. Again, that's not a pardon. In the past, Clinton supported \"Gang of 8\" legislation calling for enhanced border security, using electronic verification to verify a person's eligibility to work and a system to prevent people from staying longer than their visas. Illegal immigrants are also required to learn English, pay a fine and pay taxes, and give greater preference to the applications of immigrants who are already seeking citizenship. During this process, these immigrants were not eligible for federal public benefits. Some critics described the measure, which had not passed, as an amnesty. Proponents said that it was not an amnesty, an allegation that we generally classified as half true. One of the legal dictionary defines amnesty as \"a blanket abolition of a crime by the Government, with the legal consequence that the accused or convicted have been charged or convicted. .................................................................................... The basis of the amnesty is generally that war or other conditions that have rendered criminal acts no longer exist or their importance has disappeared.\" However, in modern American policy, the usual standard of amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act 1986. That law, endorsed by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legally permanent residents if they were able to establish their presence in the country by 1 January 1982 and met some other minimum requirements. The law has been widely described as an amnesty programme, both at that time and at the present time. Its failure to stem the flow of illegal migration is partly the reason why \"excuse\" is such a toxic word today. When the Trump campaign asked about that part of the allegation, immigration consultant Julie Kirchner said that Clinton had promised his proposal within the first 100 days. Social programs (Clinton) support proposals that make some illegal immigrants eligible for Obama care, social security and medical care. But not all illegal immigrants will be for all programs, as Trump says. On the Obamacare program, Trump is right. The Clinton website states: \"We must allow families - regardless of their immigration status - to buy exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. Families who want to buy health insurance must be able to do so.\" Also note that Trump does not mention care, food stamps or health care for the poor. Undocumented migrants are not eligible for these programmes now, and they will not be eligible for the first two programmes, even if they are granted an amnesty for their illegal arrival in the United States. They will have to become legitimate citizens or permanent residents. (If Clinton gets Obama's care coverage, Medicaid may be in play.) However, on the issue of social security and medical care, if Clinton is able to access a DAPA-like programme, approximately 4 to 5 million illegal migrants (out of an estimated 11 million undocumented migrants) will receive the name \"delayed work\" and thus become eligible to work here. On January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s discussion. \"The United States is the only industrial country that has been modernized and does not already have a paid family medical leave programme.\" So at this point, Trump is mostly true, although it gives the false impression that illegal immigrants will have the right to all social programs under Clinton. That brings us to. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ Breaking the federal budget? Will this disrupt the federal budget as Tramp claims? As we noted in an earlier examination of the facts when Tramp was filing similar claims, undocumented workers served as social security aids. Some $12 billion was added to social security trust funds in 2010. Cause: They pay in the system, but they are not - and may never be - eligible for interest. In fact, a report issued by the Department of Social Security in 2015 estimated that if both the Canadian Development Assistance Agency and the Department of Social Affairs had been implemented, it would initially have increased the ability of social security to meet its obligations in the short term. These migrant workers &apos; payments generated a slight overall increase in earnings until 2045, a general decrease from 2046 to 2082, and a neutral after 2082. They're not gonna break the federal budget this way, or they're gonna break it any more than it's already broken. As for Obama Kerr, this is not free health care. It's an insurance program that people have to buy. The more young people are enrolled, the healthier the programme is. Usually if a person is poor and registered in the Obama care programme, he or she is added to the medical care programme or the federal child health insurance programme instead. It would be expensive to register illegal immigrants in Medicaid or CHIP, although whether it would \"break\" the federal budget is a matter for discussion. We have received various estimates from experts as to how much it would cost if all the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants were placed on Medicaid or Chip, which would not be very likely. Dean Baker, co-director of the Left Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, said that the maximum cost would be about $11 billion on a federal budget of $4 trillion. However, Jeffrey Clemens, Professor of Health Economics at the University of California San Diego, said that the most reasonable estimate was $33 billion, or \"66 billion if there were a large number of people with disabilities or high-cost individuals. \"These figures are still excessive in expenditures that would actually appear,\" he said, \"because only some of the relevant population is difficult to estimate will actually get ACA funding coverage.\" In fact, as the Clinton campaign later told us, Clinton in the Register says that there should be no significant additional cost with its plan because undocumented migrants would not be eligible for private insurance support or Medicaid. This change depends on how the laws are revised. Clinton Anderson Cooper said on March 21, 2016: \"If they can afford it, they should be able to get into the market and buy it. However, this will not apply to persons in need of subsidies in order to endure this because the subsidies in question must be placed within the framework of a comprehensive migration reform.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"Hilary Clinton pledged amnesty on her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obama's care, social security, medical care for illegal immigrants, and break the federal budget. She did not undertake to grant a pardon on her first 100 days. I promised to introduce immigration legislation. Its plan does not provide Obama's care, social security and medical care to immigrants They have to pay in the system to get those benefits just like everyone else. In the case of social security and medical care, there will be at least a contract - perhaps several years - before they receive any benefits. In the case of Obama's care, even if every 11 million undocumented migrants are very poor eligible for Medicaid, it will not \"break\" the federal budget of $4 trillion. But Clinton said they wouldn't be automatically eligible for medical assistance or subsidies. Trump made a lot of mistakes here, mostly miscalculated. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3878d3cf-2365-43a5-895f-219cac443911", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04374"}
