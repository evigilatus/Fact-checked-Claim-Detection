Louise Slaughter of New York and Brian Baird of Washington, that would ban insider trading by lawmakers, members of the executive branch and staff, and require that they publicly disclose stock trades of more than $1,000 within 90 days. It would also require the \"political intelligence consultants\" to register as lobbyists in both chambers of Congress.\n\n\nWe hadn't heard the allegation that members of Congress had a leg up for insider trading and wondered if it's true.\n\n\nThomas Newkirk, a partner with the law firm Jenner and Block, told us that indeed there's some uncertainty about how insider trading rules impact members of Congress and their staff.\n\n\nFor example, in 2001, a financial consultant meeting with the Treasury Department learned that the department planned to kill off the 30-year bond. In turn, the consultant tipped off traders at Goldman Sachs who proceeded to use that information to make the firm lots of money. It was considered insider trading because the consultant knew he was not supposed to release the information, Newkirk said. Federal regulators settled with Goldman Sachs and the consultant for about $10.3 million in September 2003.\n\n\nBut with members of Congress, it's different. Unless lawmakers have some express confidentiality agreement \u2014 whether it's in writing or in word \u2014 they can do whatever they want with the information they obtain on Capitol Hill, Newkirk said.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce Carton, a former Senior Counsel with the SEC's enforcement division and current editor of\n\nSecurities Docket,\n\nagreed there is uncertainty about the rules. \"Insider trading depends on some kind of duty. You can steal information, but unless you have some sort of duty of confidentiality to it, you're not going to be held liable,\" Carton said.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight now, there is no duty of confidentiality for Congress, their staff or executive branch employees, he said.\n\n\n\"It may be unethical, and it may be unseemly, but it's not illegal,\" Carton said.\n\n\nSo yes, it seems there is a way for members of Congress to engage in insider trading. Whether they are actually doing it is another story. So far, there are no specific examples of lawmakers engaging in \"secret spending and insider trading,\" as the e-mail indicates. But for its factual claim, we give Public Citizen a True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15651"}
