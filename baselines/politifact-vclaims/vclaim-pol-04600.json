It insures more than 8 million kids,\" Clinton said in his speech at the second night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. \"There are a lot of other things in that bill she got done, piece by piece, pushing that rock up the hill.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nWe will fact-check Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in expanding health care for children.\nChildren\u2019s Health Insurance Program\nWe have previously rated a few claims related to her role in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. Some claims have been more careful in their wording about her role than others. We could not reach a Bill Clinton spokesman, but we previously interviewed a Hillary Clinton spokesman on the same topic.\nThe CHIP program provides health care coverage to more than 8 million children, according to Medicaid. Created in 1997, when it was known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, it promotes health coverage for low-income children by providing federal funding to states. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe late-Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. received much of the credit for CHIP, because he shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch was the lead Republican cosponsor.\nIn 2007, Kennedy told the Associated Press that Hillary Clinton played a critical role.\n\"The children's health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,\" Kennedy said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick Littlefield, a senior health adviser to Kennedy at the time, agreed.\n\"She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions,\" Littlefield told the Associated Press. \"But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.\"\nShortly after the legislation passed, the New York Times reported, \"Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support.\"\nThe Washington Post The Fact Checker examined her claim in an ad that she worked with Democrats and Republicans to get the law passed and concluded that was questionable. While she worked behind the scenes on the legislation, the Fact Checker wrote that there was no evidence she worked with members of both parties and instead worked with White House staff and Kennedy\u2019s office -- not Hatch.\n\"The White House wasn't for it. We really roughed them up\" in trying to get it approved over the Clinton administration's objections, Hatch told the Boston Globe in 2008. \"She may have done some advocacy (privately) over at the White House, but I'm not aware of it.\nHatch added \"I do like her,\" referring to Hillary Clinton. \"We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No -- Teddy does, but she doesn't.\"\nOur ruling\nBill Clinton said Hillary Clinton sought to expand health care piecemeal including the \"Children's Health Insurance Program.\"\nClinton did work behind the scenes to create the program to offer healthcare to children. He avoided specifying how much credit she should get for that and whether she worked with both parties to make that happen.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b271dc16-ef63-49f3-ada2-0ba27d396bd6", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04600"}
