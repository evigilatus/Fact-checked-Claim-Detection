Hurricane Delta was Louisiana\u2019s fourth hurricane or tropical storm of the year. And for only the second time in history, forecasters in 2020 used up all 21 of the year\u2019s Atlantic storm names and had to resort to Greek letters.\u00a0\nOn the numerical comparison, Pence has a point. Hurricanes that reach U.S. land are happening about as often as they did 100 years ago.\nBut that isn\u2019t all the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other scientists have to say about hurricanes and climate change.\nFocusing only on the number of storms obscures warnings from NOAA and other scientists about the effect of climate change on future storms.\u00a0\n\"If we are thinking about what to expect in the coming century, it\u2019s not just a matter of extrapolating what we saw in the past century,\" said Gabriel Vecchi, a former NOAA scientist who is now a Princeton University professor.\nScientists are more concerned about the intensity of future storms.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhil Klotzbach, a scientist at Colorado State University, said scientists are continuing to disentangle questions about climate change and hurricanes. But it\u2019s clear that skyrocketing population growth along the coast means storms today are more costly and destructive than 100 years ago, and sea level rise means more dangerous flooding from storm surge.\u00a0\nWhat to know about hurricane numbers\nPence didn\u2019t specify whether he was referring to hurricanes that made landfall around the world, or just in the U.S. (The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for clarification.) The most reliable data is for U.S. landfalling hurricanes, so we\u2019ll start there.\u00a0\nJeff Masters, meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, said it is true that the number of U.S. mainland landfalling Atlantic hurricanes has not changed appreciably in the past 100 years. There was one year about a century ago, in 1916, when nine tropical storms or hurricanes hit the mainland U.S. With Hurricane Delta, 10 have hit the U.S. this year.\n\"We are cruising through names at a record pace, but largely thanks to a lot of weak and/or short-lived ones,\" said Brian McNoldy, a University of Miami hurricane researcher. \"This is in stark contrast to the 2005 season, which also went into the Greek alphabet for the first time but produced many long-lived and very intense hurricanes.\"\nThis year\u2019s busy season doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we should expect more storms.\n\"Computer modeling results of Atlantic hurricanes are inconclusive on whether or not climate change will cause an increase or decrease in the number of Atlantic hurricanes in a future warmer climate, with some models showing a decrease, and some showing an increase,\" Masters said. \"But what theory and modeling do agree upon is that we will see the strongest hurricanes get stronger. Observations suggest that we are already seeing that occur.\"\nMasters pointed to a June 2020 research article by scientists at NOAA and the University of Wisconsin-Madison that looked at global storms from 1979 to 2017. The number of major hurricanes \u2014 Category 3 or stronger \u2014 increased globally by 15% in the later half of that period.\nMajor hurricanes are significantly more damaging than a Category 1 or 2 storm.\u00a0\nA September NOAA research analysis concluded that future hurricanes will be more intense with higher rainfall rates as a result of global warming. NOAA has said that rising sea levels, another effect of climate change, will increase the threat of storm-surge flooding during hurricanes.\nRELATED: Can a nuclear bomb stop a hurricane? No, it\u2019s a myth that has persisted for decades\nOur ruling\nPence said that NOAA said \"there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago.\"\nThe data from NOAA show there\u2019s no major difference between the number of storms today and a century ago. But his statistic doesn\u2019t mean a lot on its own. What matters more is the intensity of hurricanes, and how climate change and sea level rise will affect future intensity.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18690"}
