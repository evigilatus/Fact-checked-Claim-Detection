John Kitzhaber signed Senate Bill 833 on May 1, 2013, a group opposing the measure mapped plans to gather enough signatures to refer it to voters. Protect Oregon Driver Licenses\u2019 effort succeeded, and state voters will decide on Ballot Measure 88 in November. A yes vote would allow the law, whose implementation was suspended by the referendum effort, to take effect.\nThe claim:\nGroup members remain unhappy with the process, saying they were denied chances to participate in a 15-member work group convened by the governor before the original legislation was drafted.\nAmong statements on Protect Oregon Driver Licenses\u2019 website is this claim: Gov. John Kitzhaber formed a group to create SB 833 \"behind closed doors without allowing any input from citizens who represent the public interest.\"\nPolitiFact Oregon checked.\nThe analysis:\nWe called Jim Ludwick, communications director for Oregonians for Immigration Reform -- the parent group of Protect Oregon Driver Licenses. Although the claim was made more than a year ago in April 2013, Ludwick said the group stands by it.\nHe told us group members, hearing that the governor wanted a \"special work force to draft legislation\" to authorize driver cards, repeatedly asked the governor\u2019s staff how they could take part.\n\"We wanted a place at the table,\" Ludwick said. \"We felt we should have a right to debate the issue.\" Only later, he said, did he and others learn a work group had already been appointed.\n\"The whole thing was cooked and baked behind closed doors,\" Ludwick said. \"We were strung along and excluded at every step.\"\nLegislative records show that four Democrats and four Republicans served as the bill\u2019s primary sponsors. We emailed their offices for their take.\nRep. Chris Harker, D-Beaverton, noted apparent confusion between the work group\u2019s role and the actual drafting of the bill.\nKitzhaber convened the 15-member work group, Harker said, to make policy recommendations around an Oregon driver card. Those recommendations, he said, were combined with information provided by Driver and Motor Vehicles Services and a bipartisan group of legislators to \"inform the drafting of Senate Bill 833.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill itself sailed through through two \"very well attended public hearings,\" Harker said. He added that it was significantly amended once and had \"input from more than 20 legislators.\" Harker said that the first hearing, held April 11, 2013, drew \"so many participants they had to open three overflow rooms; hardly what I would call \u2018behind closed doors.\u2019\"\nMembers of Ludwick\u2019s group, according to legislative records, were among those testifying.\nRep. Vic Gilliam, a Republican from Silverton, was even more vociferous.\n\"The unfounded protestations by this group and other similar groups has, for me, moved from disappointing to disgusting,\" he wrote in an email. \"Claims that a bill moved through the Legislature, with committee and floor-sessions in both chambers, seems hardly to have been fashioned behind closed doors, without allowing any citizen input.\"\nThe office of another co-sponsor, state Sen. Chip Shields, D-Portland, said opponents shouldn\u2019t have been caught off-guard by the 2013 effort since Shields introduced \"a very similar bill\" the prior session, in 2011. That bill, SB 845, died in committee but not before a public hearing.\nWe then emailed the governor\u2019s office, asking who participated in the work group and whether that process proceeded in accordance with Oregon\u2019s public meetings law requirements.\nSpokeswoman Rachel Wray provided the list of participants, who represented a variety of public and private interests -- four current and retired chiefs of police; members of four Latino-affairs and advocacy organizations; a labor union representative; dairy, nursery, restaurant and winegrower representatives; someone from Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon; and a member of the governor\u2019s staff.\nWe consulted state statutes, which give the governor a green light to convene such groups, so long as they make only recommendations for his consideration.\nThe ruling:\nThe 2013 Oregon Legislature, in a bipartisan effort, approved a bill providing driver cards to those unable to prove they are in the country legally. After the governor signed the bill, a group opposing it quickly gathered enough signatures to refer SB 833 to the November ballot.\nHowever, members of the group, Protect Oregon Driver Licenses, claim they were shut out of a 15-member work group that made recommendations for how the bill should be drafted, and that the effort was fashioned \"behind closed doors without allowing any input from citizens who represent the public interest.\"\nThe work group, in accordance with Oregon public meeting law, met privately, giving some credence to the opponents\u2019 claim of meeting \"behind closed doors.\" While the work group did not include those who opposed the effort outright, it did include a wide spectrum of views, from chiefs of police to industries and individuals potentially affected by the bill.\nIn addition, the bill that ultimately passed, after two well-attended public sessions, went through at least one significant amendment and other tweaks. Dozens of people, including the opposition, testified before the bill\u2019s eventual passage, making it hard to argue that, as an opposition spokesman asserted, everything was \"cooked and baked behind closed doors.\"\nThe statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\nThoughts on this ruling? Click on over to OregonLive.com/politics to leave your comments.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07448"}
