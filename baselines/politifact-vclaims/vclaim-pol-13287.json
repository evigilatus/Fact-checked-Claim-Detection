Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., gave a speech on the Senate floor to respond to Democratic charges that the major sticking point in the negotiations was a disagreement over Planned Parenthood.\n\nMany Republicans want to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the organization does abortions. The federal government currently provides Planned Parenthood with $363 million annually, but by law, that money cannot be spent on abortion. It is spent on other types of health care services, such as cancer screenings, breast exams, and tests and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.\n\nSome opponents of abortion say that by sending any money to Planned Parenthood, taxpayers are still supporting abortions indirectly, since money is fungible. That\u2019s why they\u2019re pushing to eliminate all funding for the organization.\n\nHere\u2019s a portion of what Kyl said on the floor:\n\n\"Everybody goes to clinics, to hospitals, to doctors, and so on. Some people go to Planned Parenthood. But you don\u2019t have to go to Planned Parenthood to get your cholesterol or your blood pressure checked. If you want an abortion, you go to Planned Parenthood, and that\u2019s well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.\"\n\nWe got many requests to fact-check his statement.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says the statistics are dramatically different -- that 90 percent of its services are preventive in nature, compared with 3 percent that are abortion-related.\n\nPlanned Parenthood calculates the numbers by services provided, rather than dollars spent. In a fact sheet last updated in March 2011, the group lists the following breakdown of its services:\n\nContraception (including reversible contraception, emergency contraception, vasectomies and tubal sterilizations): 4,009,549 services\n\nSexually transmitted infections testing and treatment: 3,955,916 services\n\nCancer screening and prevention: 1,830,811 services\n\nOther women\u2019s health services (including pregnancy tests and prenatal care): 1,178,369 services\n\nAbortions: 332,278 procedures\n\nMiscellaneous (including primary care and adoption referrals): 76,977\n\nTotal services: 11,383,900\n\nBy this tally, abortions accounted for just under 3 percent of the procedures Planned Parenthood provided in 2009, which is the most recent year for which the group is reporting statistics. And that would make Kyl\u2019s statement way off.\n\nWe should note a few caveats.\n\nFirst, we think many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood\u2019s use of \"services\" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion\u2019s prominence compared to what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s worth noting that Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, although the group says each affiliate\u2019s numbers are independently audited. (There is no single, national audit.) So we have no choice but to accept their accuracy more or less on faith.\n\nStill, even with those caveats, we do think that Kyl has vastly overstated the share of abortions.\n\nWe checked with Kyl\u2019s office but did not hear back. However, a few hours after the speech, CNN anchor T.J. Holmes told viewers that the network had received a statement from Kyl\u2019s office saying that the senator\u2019s remark \"was not intended to be a factual statement but rather to illustrate that Planned Parenthood, an organization that receives millions in taxpayer dollars, does subsidize abortions.\"\n\nThe statistics from Planned Parenthood and the statement from Kyl's office make it clear that he erred by saying abortion counts for well over 90 percent of the group's services. We find his claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13287"}
