He resigned first", "text": "Former President Richard Nixon is making a comeback, this time as congressional Democrats mull impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.\nJust this week, the House Judiciary Committee heard testimony on Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s final report from Nixon\u2019s former White House counsel, John Dean, a key witness in the Watergate scandal.\nWhat\u2019s often forgotten about Nixon is that, while he\u2019s the only U.S. president to resign from office, he was never actually impeached.\nThe latest public figure to bobble this fact was Jimmy Kimmel, host of ABC\u2019s late-night show, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"\nKimmel\u2019s comment came during the June 6 episode\u00a0of his show, as part of an extended joke breaking down Trump\u2019s recent feud with actress Bette Midler. The comedian listed several far-fetched connections between Trump, Nixon and Midler\u2019s 1993 film \"Hocus Pocus\" as evidence for why Trump lashed out at her on Twitter.\n\"Richard Nixon was the last president to be impeached by a \u2018witch hunt,\u2019\" he said at one point.\nWe found Kimmel\u2019s joke funny, but also worth fact-checking. Our finding: Kimmel was wrong in a few ways, and the history is worth a review.\nFor starters, Nixon was not the latest president to face the prospect of impeachment. That was Bill Clinton. The House of Representatives impeached him in 1998, but the Senate ultimately acquitted him.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore importantly, Nixon was never impeached. Impeachment requires a formal vote, and the House has only voted to impeach two presidents \u2014 Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Clinton more than 100 years later. (Johnson was also acquitted.) Nixon\u2019s story was different.\nIn Nixon\u2019s case, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment in July 1974 and reported them to the full House for consideration. But after the Supreme Court forced him to release incriminating White House tapes, Nixon resigned in August 1974, leaving office before the House could vote on impeachment.\nStill, it was widely believed at the time that Nixon would have been ousted if he\u2019d stayed around. \"Nixon would definitely have been impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate if he had not resigned first,\" said Ken Hughes, a historian at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center and an expert on Nixon\u2019s secret recordings.\nTimothy Naftali, professor of public service at New York University and the former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, added that impeachment \"by an overwhelming bipartisan majority was beyond question\" and \"as close to inevitable as can be.\"\nA spokesperson for \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" did not respond to requests for comment.\nOur ruling\nKimmel said, \"Richard Nixon was the last president to be impeached by a 'witch hunt.'\"\nNixon probably would have been kicked out if he hadn\u2019t resigned first, and the impeachment process against him had begun.\nBut only two presidents have actually been impeached, and Nixon was not one of them. He resigned before the House had the chance to vote on the articles of impeachment.\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00536"}
