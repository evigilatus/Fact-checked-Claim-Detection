President Donald Trump is expected to sign it into law.\n\"215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers,\" Fight for the Future tweeted March 28, after the bill passed the House.\n215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers #BroadbandPrivacy pic.twitter.com/m1HkVptuNt\u2014 Fight for the Future (@fightfortheftr) March 28, 2017\n\nFight for the Future has the vote count right; 215 members of the House of Representatives voted for the measure. We decided to dig into whether the group is right about what the bill means for online shopping.\nISPs and the bill\nFight for the Future\u2019s tweet might give the misleading impression that ISPs can\u2019t already see their customers\u2019 online purchases and sell that information. They can. Congress\u2019 action just makes this explicitly legal.\nAn ISP\u2019s function is to connect its users to websites or online apps, and so it can see nearly everything its users do on the Internet, including what kind of underwear they buy. An advertiser might be interested in purchasing that information from an ISP because then it can predict whether a given user is more likely to respond to an ad for boxers, briefs or tighty-whities.\nBeyond shopping habits, ISPs and advertisers can glean more significant personal information about their customers from Internet browsing patterns \u2014 like that\u00a0a spouse is contemplating divorce because he looked up \"best divorce lawyers in my area,\" or that a person has a chronic medical condition because she spent a long time reading certain pages on WebMD.\nIn October 2016, the FCC established rules intended to give consumers more control over how ISPs used their data. The rules required ISPs to obtain explicit information from their customers before using and sharing their web browsing history, which would include underwear purchases.\nThe rule also required the ISPs to get consent before sharing other \"sensitive information,\" like Social Security numbers, precise geolocation data and financial or health information. Many Internet companies and trade associations had already committed to requiring consumers to opt-in before they can share that sort of information, per guidance from the Federal Trade Commission.\nBut these opt-in rules never went into effect; Congress killed them in March 2017, months before the December 2017 start date. So ISPs can see and use customers\u2019 web browsing data as they always have.\n\"Practically speaking, I expect consumers will see no change in how their data is collected and marketed,\" said Brent Skorup, a technology policy research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center.\nFight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer said Congress\u2019 vote was significant because it gives ISP companies explicit permission to engage in practices that some privacy advocates consider \"abusive,\" and it gives ISPs an incentive to invest in systems to further these practices.\nISPs have been expanding the scope of their operations, merging with other varieties of service providers, such as Verizon purchasing AOL, or AT&T\u2019s planned deal to purchase Time Warner, Inc. This, combined with Congress\u2019 reversal of the FCC rules, might encourage ISPs to expand their role in online advertising, said Peter Swire, a professor at Georgia Tech and the chief counselor for privacy during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of online advertising today,\" Swire said. \"Now the big broadband companies will play more actively in that space.\"\nThose who supported gutting the FCC rules argue that the regulations put ISPs at a disadvantage compared to other Internet companies, like search engines or social media sites, that already sell users\u2019 data without first getting permission. They also say the rules stifle technology innovation.\nPrivacy advocates, however, say that ISPs have an especially large window into its users Internet habits, and this rule could have opened up the possibility of beginning to enact privacy regulations on other web-based companies.\n\"This is troublesome because of the larger question: Is privacy opt in or opt out?\" said Jamie Winterton, director of strategy for Arizona State University\u2019s Global Security Initiative. \"Can your browser behaviors be bought and sold?\"\nPrivacy protections\nThough they can see a lot, there are limitations to what ISPs can see.\nSome websites use encryption, so the ISP can see the domain name but not the exact page on that website the user is browsing. A website is encrypted if the address starts with \"https\" not \"http.\" For example, if a web user visit the Macy\u2019s website, which is encrypted, their ISP will know they\u2019re browsing the Macy\u2019s website, but it won\u2019t know if they\u2019re shopping for underwear, a prom dress or bedding. (The article you\u2019re currently reading is not encrypted.)\nHowever, if someone visits MeUndies.com right after visiting VictoriasSecret.com \u2014 both encrypted \u2014 an advertiser can probably make an educated guess that the person is in the market for some underwear. There are many more sophisticated ways an ISP or third party can glean information about a user even when the data is encrypted.\nRegardless, most ecommerce sites remain unencrypted, Swire said.\nAn Internet user who really does not want an ISP tracking any of their data can use a Virtual Private Network, which, put simply, is a way to scramble all Internet traffic so the ISP and potential hackers can\u2019t get at it. But this might not completely eliminate privacy concerns because some VPNs themselves don\u2019t fully protect users\u2019 data.\n\"If you don\u2019t want any of your information out there, you\u2019d have to do all sorts of things,\" Winterton said. \"It\u2019s a lot to ask of people.\"\nOur ruling\nFight for the Future said, \"215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers.\"\nISPs can see most of the websites their customers visit. Congress, with 215 votes from the House, sent a bill to Trump\u2019s desk that codified ISPs\u2019 ability to sell their customers' web browsing data, including any online underwear purchases that aren\u2019t encrypted.\nRegulations enacted in 2016 would have required ISPs to ask customers for explicit permission to share this data with advertisers or other third parties. But Congress acted before the regulations went into effect.\nFight for the Future\u2019s phrasing \u2014 and use of the loaded term \"spy\" \u2014 might lead people to think that Congress\u2019 action gave ISPs new freedoms, but they could always view and sell users\u2019 web browsing information. Now they have Congress\u2019 stamp of approval to do so without getting users\u2019 permission first.\nThat context is important, so we rate Fight for the Future\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    2 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  \"215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers.\"     Fight for the Future advocacy group   on Twitter Tuesday, March 28, 2017 03/28/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03499"}
