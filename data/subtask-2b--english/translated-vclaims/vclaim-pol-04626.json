That meant putting an end to the violence and crime suffered by the country. Trump added that there were illegal immigrants in the country abroad who put communities at risk. \"Almost 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered to be deported from our country, tonight, wandering freely to threaten peaceful citizens,\" said Trump in his acceptance speech on Thursday. We looked into this number to see if many of the immigrants convicted with deportation on the streets. According to the Trump campaign, his statement came from a report issued in June 2016 by the Centre for Migration Studies, a think tank that prefers stricter immigration policies. The Centre for Migration Studies also relied on data obtained by the Judicial Committee of the Senate. According to the Commonwealth of Independent States, there were more than 925,000 migrants who had been ordered to be deported but were still in the country as of July 2015. It is estimated that 20 per cent of them have been convicted of at least one criminal offence and almost all of them are at large. The Trump numbers are therefore correct. However, experts say that there are some important contexts. Ana Gonz\u00e1lez-Barera, a senior researcher at the Pio Research Centre, said that this figure included immigrants from countries that would never accept them again. \"In these cases, immigrants must be released after they have completed their sentence,\" said Gonz\u00e1lez-Barera. In other cases, state and local jurisdictions have adopted policies that limit cooperation with immigration authorities so that they do not notify them when a non-citizen who can be deported completes his or her prison term or sentence, as stated by Michel Metelstadt, Director of Communications at the Institute of Migration Policy. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, Jennifer Elzia, spokesman for the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, the Immigration and Customs Authority makes decisions on custody on a case-by-case basis, \"taking into account all the advantages and factors of each case while adhering to the current priorities, guidelines and legal mandates of the Agency.\" \"those who are not subject to mandatory detention and do not pose a threat to the community may be placed under some form of supervision as an alternative to detention while waiting for a hearing before the Migration Court,\" Eliza said. However, the Centre for Migration Studies refers to a report issued by the Institute in February 2016, which indicates that between fiscal year 2010 and 21 July 2015, 124 criminal migrants who were subsequently released from detention at the Centre were charged with murder-related offences. Our Governor Trump said, \"Almost 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered their deportation from our country, tonight they roam freely to threaten peaceful citizens.\" According to federal data, 925,000 migrants were requested to be deported but remain in the country in July 2015. It is estimated that 20 per cent of them have been convicted of at least one criminal offence and almost all of them are at large. However, immigration officials say that they make decisions on detention on a case-by-case basis, and that those who do not pose a threat to society may be placed under some form of supervision as an alternative. The Trump statement is accurate, but we need more information, and we evaluate it mostly correctly. Update: We have added information from the CIA that they make custody decisions on a case-by-case basis. We have also added a report showing that between fiscal year 2010 and 21 July 2015, 124 criminal migrants released from immigration and customs detention were subsequently charged with murder-related offences. Correction: An earlier version of this article wrongly mentions persons seeking asylum who are not brought before immigration judges as being excluded because of their criminal behaviour. https://www.sharethects.co/share/aaa2fc627-324a-45ec-be8b-7632680d76c6", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04626"}
