This video was edited to create a false narrative.\nThe 29-second video features a split screen, a reporter on the left and Biden on the right. The reporter at the beginning says: \"Joining us live this morning from New York, hey good morning.\"\nA few quick things wrong with the start of that clip: it cuts out key words the reporter said, namely that she was addressing singer, songwriter and activist Harry Belafonte:\n\"Harry Belafonte joining us live this morning from New York, hey good morning, Harry,\" she said.\nAlso, the Belafonte interview happened in 2011, and Biden had nothing to do with it.\nThe Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

You know how I know? I was the coanchor in studio. We were interviewing Harry Belafonte.\" In a follow-up tweet, Dabkovich tweeted a link to the original video from nearly a decade ago.\n(Description for the 2011 video says: Was legendary actor and singer Harry Belafonte asleep during a live satellite interview Friday morning with Eyewitness News? His publicist says no.\")\nTwitter flagged Scavino\u2019s post as manipulated media.\nThe fabricated video has text toward the bottom of the screen that falsely says: \"On air: Joe Biden | The importance of this election.\" The original video with Belafonte, of course, did not have that text. The manipulated video also includes snoring sound effects that didn\u2019t come from either Belafonte or Biden.\nAs the Associated Press reported, the Biden clip is from an April town hall on COVID-19 with 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Biden didn\u2019t fall asleep there, either. The doctored video pulled from a point in the interview when Biden was looking down. He later looked up. A social media user told the Associated Press he created the altered video.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims Biden was asleep and snoring during a TV interview.\nThat didn\u2019t happen. The video was edited to create a deceiving and inaccurate narrative.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17212"}
