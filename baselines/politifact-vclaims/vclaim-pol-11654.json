We explored that criticism, and are confident in our original analysis.\n\nThe White House, defending a decision requiring many Catholic hospitals, schools and charities to offer contraception coverage to employees, argues that most women \u2014 including most Catholic women \u2014 use birth control.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCecilia Mu\u00f1oz, \u00a0director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, marshaled this statistic in a Feb. 1, 2012, blog post:\n\n\"According to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church doesn\u2019t approve of \"contraceptive interventions\" to prevent pregnancy. We wondered: Did a reputable study say that most Catholic women have used birth control anyway?\n\nThe decision\n\nThe Obama administration decision, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Jan. 20, 2012, addressed which preventive services must be covered by most insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the patient.\n\nThose services include all FDA-approved forms of contraception. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012.\n\nBut the rule provides an exemption for \"certain non-profit religious employers\" -- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools. That\u2019s far too narrow an exemption, the \u00a0U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops argues.\n\nThat's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve Catholics \u2014 ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups.\n\nThe government is giving such nonprofit religious groups an extra year to implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them.\n\nThe bishops are leading a charge to reverse the decision, but the administration so far hasn\u2019t budged, instead citing statistics in support of its position, such as from the Guttmacher study.\n\nThe study\n\nWe found the study. \u00a0It\u2019s been making the rounds, cited by news organizations when it was released in April 2011, referenced by the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in a January column and underpinning talking points for Obama administration officials speaking on background Feb. 2.\n\n(The Guttmacher Institute, named for obstetrician-gynecologist Alan Guttmacher, says it advances sexual and reproductive health and rights with research, policy analysis and education. Not surprisingly, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops routinely objects to its conclusions and analysis, responding on its website, usccb.org.)\n\nThe study, \"Countering Conventional Wisdom: New Evidence on Religion and Contraceptive Use,\" is based on government data collected in the National Survey of Family Growth.\n\nThe survey has been conducted seven times since 1973 by the National Center for Health Statistics, with the most recent cycle in 2006-10. The survey includes women ages 15 to 44. Researchers conduct personal interviews to gather information on marriage, divorce, contraception, infertility and health of women and infants.\n\nThe source is regularly used for studies on contraceptives and religion, including one we found published by the Catholic Medical Association. (The 2001 article found the high rate of contraceptive use by Catholic women \"not new or surprising.\")\n\nResearchers ask women for their religious affiliation, including details about how important a role religion plays in their lives and how often they attend religious services.\n\nGuttmacher\u2019s study relies on data from the survey\u2019s interviews with 7,356 women between June 2006 and December 2008, focusing on those who called themselves Catholic, mainline Protestant and evangelical Protestant.\n\nThe numbers are stark, according to the study:\n\n\"Among all women who have had sex, 99 percent have ever used a contraceptive method other than natural family planning. This figure is virtually the same, 98 percent, among sexually experienced Catholic women.\"\n\n(Interestingly, the Guttmacher study noted that \"attendance at religious services and importance of religion to daily life are largely unrelated to use of highly effective contraceptive methods.\")\n\nBishops\u2019 response\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops responded to Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s blog post with a post of its own Feb. 3, 2012.\n\nIt didn\u2019t directly dispute the 98 percent statistic. But the post did argue it was irrelevant and used in a misleading way.\n\n\"If a survey found that 98 percent of people had lied, cheated on their taxes, or had sex outside of marriage, would the government claim it can force everyone to do so?\" the post said.\n\nThe bishops also argued:\n\n\u2022 The study says 98 percent of \"sexually experienced\" women, a distinction Mu\u00f1oz didn\u2019t make. (Sexually experienced women accounted for most of the women in the sample, including 70 percent of never-married Catholic women.)\n\n\u2022 The more relevant Guttmacher statistic would be use of \"highly effective\" methods of contraception covered by the new rule, such as the pill, IUDs and sterilization, among sexually active women who don\u2019t want to become pregnant \u2014 68 percent for Catholic women and 69 percent for all women.\n\nWhat the bishops don\u2019t mention is that this statistic looks only at women who have had sex within three months of the survey, and that \"highly effective\" methods don't include FDA-approved contraception such as condoms, sponges or suppositories. And the number they cite still represents most of the women in that category. But the bishops argued that this smaller group must be a minority of the general public, \"yet every man and woman who needs health insurance will have to pay for this coverage.\"\n\nSo the bishops are using a snapshot in time and arguing it\u2019s a minority of women. At any given point, women would be excluded because they\u2019re pregnant, postpartum, trying to get pregnant or not having sex. The same women might not be excluded in a different month or year. That\u2019s why the \"ever used\" question is relevant.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMu\u00f1oz said, \"according to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception.\"\n\nWe read the study, which was based on long-collected, frequently cited government survey data. It says essentially that \u2014 though the statistic refers specifically to women who have had sex, a distinction Mu\u00f1oz didn\u2019t make.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a large clarification, since most women in the study, including 70 percent of unmarried Catholic women, were sexually experienced.\n\nCatholic bishops argue it\u2019s more relevant to note the percentage of sexually active women who don\u2019t want to become pregnant and who currently use hormones, IUDs or sterilization \u2014 since the smaller number would provide smaller justification for spreading the cost of contraceptives to the general public.\n\nBut we think it\u2019s reasonable to note that most women have used contraceptives even if they aren\u2019t currently using them. It means most women would find occasion to take advantage of the new co-pay-free contraceptive rule. \u00a0Meanwhile, Mu\u00f1oz used the phrase \"have used,\" which made it clear she meant women who had used contraception before, not necessarily now.\n\nIt would have been clearest if Mu\u00f1oz had specified she was talking about women who have had sex \u2014 and perhaps that the statistic referred to women ages 15 to 44. But her statement was otherwise accurate. We rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11654"}
