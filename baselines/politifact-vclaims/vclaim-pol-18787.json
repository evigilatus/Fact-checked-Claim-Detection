As evidence, the user cites a post on a fringe internet platform where users can post anonymously.\n\"Someone posted on 8Kun that Hunter died of a crack overdose and Joe already on way to hospital,\" the Facebook post says. \"I can\u2019t verify (this) but (a) crack (overdose) sounds like BS or code. We know something like this will be going down just don\u2019t know when.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

No news organizations, including celebrity gossip outlets like TMZ, have reported that Hunter Biden overdosed.\u00a0\nThe rumor originated on internet platforms known to spread disinformation.\n8kun, formerly known as 8chan, calls itself \"the darkest reaches of the internet.\" The site rebranded in fall 2019 after manifestos related to three mass shootings were posted on the platform.\nSeveral Facebook and Instagram posts claiming Hunter Biden died cite a thread on 4chan, another forum that\u2019s similar to 8kun. The thread, posted by an anonymous user with an avatar of a frog in a robe, says Hunter Biden overdosed Oct. 25.\n\"Joe is already on his way to the hospital,\" the thread claims.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Joe Biden held a virtual concert Oct. 25 and spoke during the event, which started after the 4chan thread was posted.\u00a0\nThe 4chan thread and related Facebook posts are part of a conspiracy theory involving Hunter Biden\u2019s purported laptop, which the New York Post reported earlier this month was left at a Delaware computer repair shop.\u00a0\nThe theory goes like this: A laptop belonging to Hunter Biden contains illicit images of minors, which the FBI is investigating. In order to hide the evidence, someone will kill Hunter Biden and make it look like an accident. That playbook is similar to what happened to Jeffrey Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender who died in jail in August 2019.\nThere is no evidence to support that conspiracy theory. We\u2019ve debunked similar claims about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop and Epstein\u2019s death.\nRELATED:\u00a0Fact-checking unproven claims about Hunter Biden and child pornography\nWhat\u2019s true is that Hunter Biden has struggled with drug addiction in the past, something that his father has addressed on the campaign trail.\n\"My son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem,\" Biden said during the first presidential debate in September. \"He's overtaken it, he's fixed it, he's worked on it, and I'm proud of him.\"\nWe reached out to the Biden campaign for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate.
