Tampa Bay Rice is the third Evan Longroya baseman to talk to a TV reporter along the first base line. Their backs are facing baseball diamonds, and the two are standing 125 feet from the houseboard -- where Ray's colleague is beating. The teammate sprays the chain of command directly on them. In abundance, loguriya wheels around his head and torso, stretching his right arm and holding the ball bare-handed. The TV reporter shouts, Longoria shakes the pain in his hand and throws the ball back towards the archers' hill. \"Keep it in the field\" says, rudely. The video: 24 seconds was first published on YouTube on May 6, 2011 by Mr. Sprts12 and has since been seen more than 3.8 million times. The bigger question: Is the video real? Or is it fake? Polyte Fact Florida decided to take a break from politics to put the viral video now -- and Rice's third star -- to the truth-O-Meter. At first glance, fishing seems unlikely. And to baseball fans, maybe even impossible. But baseball guys have done nice, bare-handed robberies before. In 1989, then San Francisco giants off the field Kevin Mitchell planted a flyball off St. Louis Cardinals' short bat Ozzie Smith with his bare right hand. In 2005, New York Mets III, a baseman, David Wright, had a pigeon on his shoulder to catch a fly with bare hands. Mitchell and Wright were in the middle of the games, we should notice, and we saw the ball coming. Longoria didn't have time to respond. Stuart Sternberg stated on June 21, 2010, in a press release, that the prices of \"Tamba Bay Rice\" had been sentenced to the cheapest price in all professional sports. By Aaron Sharokman on June 24, 2010, we know many details about the origins of the video, as Lugoria himself explained to the St. Petersburg Times Mark Tupkin and Tampa Tribeon Roger Mooney. Lungoria said that the video was filmed near the end of spring training after Lungoria spent nearly six hours filming a Gillette ad. Lungoria said that the video was filmed in the McKinney Field in Bradton, Spring House of Pittsburgh Pirates. He claims it's original. The video -- \"It's still real, by the way,\" said he was shot with a portable camera in one taken in about five minutes, after Gillette was announced cabbage. \"Unbelievable, huh?\" He said that Lungoria, the spokesman for Gillette, had made other announcements. \"It's funny when you talk about things that spread through viruses, they really do that once you get things like Twitter and YouTube. It's moving from a little snowball to a fast snowfall.\" Let's go back to the tape. Because there are many things that don't add up. In the video there are four visible glitter slogans -- two behind the house plate and two on the rooftop front on the third base runways. But those slogans aren't part of McKinney Field in real life. The logos were digitally added and included in the final video published on YouTube. Then there's the user who posted the video, Mr. Sprts12. The user created his YouTube account on May 4th and only uploaded the Lungoria video. The user mentions his company as Gillette. Then there's the reporter and the graphic video that characterizes Longoria. There are no symbols or messages for the television station on video, and the reporter carries a microphone without a \"scientific\" specifying the station where the journalist works. Maybe even weird, we couldn't find the video posted on any news site. (Sure, a TV station likes to call the video as they do.) A strong circumstantial case that the video was manipulated. But we wanted to keep looking. We asked Topkin -- who covered baseball for the Times since 1987 -- what he thought about the video. From Detroit, where the Rays were playing Detroit tigers, Topekin said he thought it was a fake. Tobin observed several things that were not typical during a beating training session. There is no cage around the strike to catch foul balls or stop shootings that do not strike. There's also no screen that protects the shooter's beating training. There are no coaches in the video that hit groundballs or other players on baseball diamonds to track any blows. There's more. The blow, after hitting the ball right in Longoria and the reporter, didn't hear the scream for them to get out of the way. Although Longoria hunts my wonders, the beating immediately goes back to his striking position as if nothing had even happened. The photographer doesn't warn the reporter or Lungoria either. There is a framework analysis of the video. If you're watching closely enough, the ball falls towards the ground as it approaches Lungura and the reporter. But in the last frame -- right before Lungoria caught the ball -- it seems to be moving up again. \"Simply, once the ball starts on a downward path, it cannot go back up without external power,\" wrote YouTube user Smelting Smoke, one of several thousand people to comment on or question the authenticity of the video. \"It's obviously happening before the ball is taught.\" It's not the same ball and its track is completely wrong.\" The Times were asking readers online if they thought hunting was real or fake. The great majority, though not all, says it's a trick. With the evidence overwhelmingly indicating that the video was a fake, we asked the spokesman for Gillette Michael Norton if the company would put the mystery to rest. \"The video was filmed while it was on the site of the Gillette Vaughn Burgled ad,\" told Norton. \"We'll leave.\" Is it real? \"The debate reaches viewers.\" We're ready to judge you. From Gillette's computer-added sign, to the photographer's reaction and blow, from the way the main league teams do the beating, to video evidence, this viral YouTube video is a smart piece of advertising. And fantasy. Longoria is a good sport -- and the Gillette spokesman -- to say that hunting is real. But we don't believe it. We say pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13047"}
