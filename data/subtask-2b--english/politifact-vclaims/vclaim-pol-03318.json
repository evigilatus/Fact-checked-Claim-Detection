Bill Zedler said a federal program that gathers reports of vaccination side-effects doesn\u2019t draw in all kinds of outcomes.\nThe Houston physician disputed Zedler on that, leading us to roll out the Truth-O-Meter.\nWe heard about the pair\u2019s vigorous public back and forth from Jason Sabo, a lobbyist for the Immunization Partnership, a Katy-based nonprofit focused on eradicating vaccine-preventable diseases. Sabo emailed us a web link to a video excerpt from the April 25, 2017, hearing of the House Public Health Committee on House Bill 1124, which would make it easier for parents to opt children out of having immunizations required to attend public schools.\nThe video initially shows Lindy McGee, a physician at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, opposing the measure on behalf of herself and the partnership.\nZedler, R-Arlington, then pressed McGee about his conclusion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database that more people have died from the measles vaccination than from measles, a claim he repeated in our May 2017 follow-up interview with him (there\u2019s a fact-check in the works).\nAt the hearing, McGee replied that the database, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or VAERS, doesn\u2019t \"report causality. People report to that system what they\u2019ve seen. So I can report if I get hit by a truck after I\u2019ve gotten a vaccine and that would be reported as associated with a vaccine. It does not make any implication of causality. That\u2019s just the way it is.\"\nMcGee went on: \"So that is just everyone reporting any time they\u2019ve had an adverse event, any time within a certain amount of period from having a vaccine. It does not make any implications about causality. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s set up.\"\nThe parry-and-thrust\u00a0went on:\nZedler: \"So in other words, all you\u2019ve got to do is just think it could be.\"\nMcGee: \"Yes. That\u2019s exactly what it is. So I could break my arm the next day and I can report that to that reporting system. And I want the reporting system, it\u2019s meant to be set up that way because that\u2019s how we can figure out if vaccines cause injury.\"\nZedler: \"No, no, no, no, are you going to tell me that if somebody got a vaccine, and within hours to days had died, that it\u2019s not due to the vaccine?\"\nMcGee: \"It\u2019s not necessarily due to the vaccine, no, absolutely not. I could have a vaccine and I could get hit by a truck tomorrow and die. I could have a vaccine and I could commit suicide tomorrow and die. I could have a vaccine and have a heart attack tomorrow.\"\nZedler: \"Whoa, stop, stop. Nobody puts that down.\"\nMcGee: \"Yes, they do.\"\nZedler: \"No, they don\u2019t.\"\nMcGee: \"Yes, they do.\"\nZedler: \"Let me tell you, that is patently false and you know it.\"\nMcGee: \"It\u2019s not. You can look at it. You can look at the reports.\"\nZedler: \"So they put on there and they say, oh, just any death, and we don\u2019t have to prove causality?\"\nMcGee: \"Yes. It\u2019s not a system to prove causality. It\u2019s a system to track data and then the physicians or researchers at the CDC go and determine causality after that. It is not a system that could determine causality, it\u2019s not.\"\nZedler said a moment later: \"For you to get up and tell this committee that in essence they can put anything down there they want is quite a dishonest.\"\nMcGee: \"No, you can. You can report anything you want to.\"\nZedler: \"Well, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t buy that. And you know what? For you to tell this committee that is dishonest.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcGee: \"I welcome committee members to look up the system.\"\nZedler reaffirms statement\nWe took McGee up on that, also reaching out to the CDC, also\u00a0following up with Zedler, who said in an interview off the House floor that he was trying to say at the hearing that people don\u2019t routinely report automobile accidents and the like as the result of vaccinations. \"Now you might find one or two kind-of unusual ones,\" Zedler said of reports recorded in the VAERS (pronounced vairs). \"That they were killed in an automobile accident--nonsense.\"\nProgram open to reports of effects from anyone\nThe VAERS, according to the CDC, is a national vaccine safety surveillance program co-sponsored by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration that, since its launch in 1990, has collected hundreds of thousands of reports of \"adverse events\" that occurred after the administration of vaccines in the United States.\n\"Anyone can file a VAERS report,\" CDC says, \"including health care providers, manufacturers, and vaccine recipients. The majority of VAERS reports are sent in by vaccine manufacturers (37%) and health care providers (36%). The remaining reports are obtained from state immunization programs (10%), vaccine recipients (or their parent/guardians, 7%) and other sources (10%).\"\nBy email to our inquiry, CDC spokeswoman Martha Sharan stressed that the program accepts all reports without rendering judgment on clinical importance or whether a vaccine or vaccines might have caused the adverse event. Investigators focus, though, on \"the reports that \u2018signal\u2019 a possible safety problem,\" Sharan wrote.\nOn its website, the agency similarly says that every adverse effect recorded by the program isn\u2019t confirmed to have resulted from a vaccine.\n\"VAERS receives reports of many adverse events that occur after vaccination. Some occur coincidentally following vaccination, while others may be caused by vaccination,\" CDC says. \"Studies help determine if a vaccine really caused an adverse event.\"\nEven the Hulk?\nRehka Lakshmanan of the Immunization Partnership, responding to our inquiry, suggested we look up an anesthesiologist she described as having reported to the VAERS that after a vaccination, he felt like he was turning into the Hulk of Marvel Comics fame.\nIn a July 2005 web post, Dr. James R. Laidler wrote: \"The chief problem with the VAERS data is that reports can be entered by anyone and are not routinely verified. To demonstrate this, a few years ago I entered a report that an influenza vaccine had turned me into The Hulk. The report was accepted and entered into the database.\n\"Because the reported adverse event was so\u2026 unusual,\" Laidler wrote, \"a representative of VAERS contacted me. After a discussion of the VAERS database and its limitations, they asked for my permission to delete the record, which I granted. If I had not agreed, the record would be there still, showing that any claim can become part of the database, no matter how outrageous or improbable.\"\nWe did not find primary documentation of Laidler\u2019s described VAERS submission though he reaffirmed such actions in a phone interview. Laidler, of Portland, Ore., said he recalled submitting a\u00a0report in the early 2000s stating that after a measles vaccination, his skin turned green, his muscles grew and he started having rage problems--all symptoms intended to show he was becoming the Hulk. Laidler said his greater point, in the face of others who were citing VAERS entries as an indication the measles vaccination causes autism, was that anyone may report any adverse effect of a vaccination to the program.\nBy email, the CDC\u2019s Sharan separately replied that the Hulk story \"is true.\"\nChecking reported effects from Texas, U.S.\nOnline, we queried the VAERS database for serious reported side-effects of vaccinations in Texas.\nAmong 635 summarized results dating from 1990 into February 2017, we spotted one mention of suicide; after a person got a seasonal flu shot in 2013, he was diagnosed with Auto Immune Limbic Encephalitis, according to the entry, and had suicidal thoughts.\nWe also looked for entries about car or truck accidents.\nAccording to one entry, a physician reported in 2008 that a woman who received a dose of Gardasil was subsequently \"found dead in her truck from a blood clot that traveled from her legs to her lungs.\"\nAnother entry says an 18-year-old woman vaccinated against meningitis \"passed out while driving her car and crossed over the highway into oncoming traffic\" before dying. A third entry says a woman who\u2019d received a flu shot \"passed out while driving. She required emergency abdominal exploration for bleeding\" and internal injuries, the entry says.\nOur search yielded three reports of Texas heart attacks after vaccinations. In October 2007, an entry says, a 68-year-old man got a flu shot, then died from a heart attack by the next morning. In 2015, a person had a heart attack on the day he or she got vaccinated against pneumococcal pneumonia, subsequently spending five days in a hospital, the entry says. In May 2016, according to another entry, a 61-year-old man died after a heart attack and car accident that occurred 10 days after he got a shot.\nWe ran a similar search for serious reported post-vaccination events nationally in the year up to March 2017. From 159 results, we identified a reported fatal heart attack reported in Indiana after a flu shot in 2016.\nOur ruling\nZedler said a federal program that compiles reported side-effects of vaccinations doesn\u2019t take in reports of extreme results such as road accidents, heart attacks and suicides.\nIt looks to us, from our sampling, that\u00a0some results such as suicides are rarely reported as related to vaccinations. Still, the CDC-run VAERS evidently accepts reports of all kinds of outcomes from all corners, though having a submission accepted doesn't equal federal confirmation that a vaccination caused any effects. Further investigation might.\nWe rate Zedler's claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.
