As our friends noted in factcheck.org in this article, Richardson consistently referred to the larger number, even when the actual number was lower. Let's judge anyway, we'll rely on the current 75800 and consider it mostly true. It is difficult to calculate the magnitude of the significant role played by tax cuts in making companies create such jobs. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story of General David H. Berger, US Navy Commander. They rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use Marines for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" In fact, most of the job growth in the state started before Richardson became Governor, Peach said. However, Peech stated that tax incentives and income tax cuts, Richardson, created a favourable business climate, a stark change from the state mentality in the mid-1970s, when State officials refused to provide assistance to a promising young company called Microsoft. \"The climate here has changed a lot since then,\" said Peech. Bill Richardson was a big part of it. It's not the whole story, but it was a big part of it.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00339"}
