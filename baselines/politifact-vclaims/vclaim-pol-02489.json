The story has no evidence and is fake news. The story attributes the information to Ladies of Liberty, a website that describes itself as satire.\nMueller was appointed by the Justice Department as special counsel to investigate connections between President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and Russia. In May, Pelosi supported Mueller\u2019s appointment as a \"first step\" but in October called for an \"outside, fully independent investigation.\"\nThe Patriot Report said that Pelosi and Mueller had a 13-year affair that will force Mueller to resign, but Pelosi will hold her California congressional seat until she dies.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story said that Pelosi said her husband was aware of the affair and that her \"husband was afforded the same freedom to explore 'pleasures of the flesh.'\u00a0\"\nPelosi has never made any such comment.\nFictional affairs are common fodder on fake news websites. We previously debunked fake articles claiming that U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, had an affair with former FBI Director James Comey, and that U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had an affair with a cheerleader. We rated both of those claims Pants on Fire.\nWe sent a message to The Patriot Report on Facebook and did not get a reply.\nA headline said\u00a0that \"Mueller will be forced to resign over Pelosi affair.\" There is no evidence that such an affair occurred. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7cc9a475-7526-405a-bbbd-22d8b5e6ccd5", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02489"}
