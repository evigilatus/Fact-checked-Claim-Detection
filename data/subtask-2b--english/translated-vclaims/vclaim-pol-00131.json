As at 15 August, the post had been shared at least 87,000 times as of 24 September. The reader wanted to know whether it was true that no white migrant had been deported by the United States Immigration and Customs Department, or the Immigration and Customs Agency. There is no evidence of this. There are no sources in Facebook, and there are no corresponding government news or statements to support it. The Immigration and Naturalization Authority does not follow deportations on the basis of race or ethnic origin. The agency has statistics on where people are sent, but that alone does not refer to someone's race. The Pew Research Centre estimated that in 2017 there were 9.75 million unauthorized persons aged 18 years and over. Of the 9.75 million people, about 700,000 were white (not Spanish), according to Pew. In July 2017, the organization published a story about a man from Ireland who had been deported from the United States for exceeding his visa. The story knows the deportee, John Canningham, as a white immigrant. In addition to Kingham, another man from Ireland who lived illegally in the United States and a representative of the International Irish Immigration Center in Boston, \"all of them admitted that, as white men, they could fly under the radar of those who link unauthorized immigrants with Mexico and Central America,\" told the story of PRI. A year before Canningham was arrested, he told Bree: \"Most people think they're undocumented and think people across the southern border. They don't think about the Irish guy who lives next to them. They don't see that part of it, but we have to live with it every day.\" On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 On 3 February 2021 NPR in January 2018, she also reported that Dylan Oryodan, 19, from Ireland, had been detained by the Immigration and Customs Authority and was due to be deported. \"or Riordan did not necessarily believe that he would be white would save him from deportation orders. He thought staying out of trouble would keep him under radar. He says that the other detainees were surprised that he was arrested. \"The story says. NPR informed the Immigration and Naturalization Authority that Oriodan had exceeded its admission requirements. In fiscal year 2018, the Institute deported approximately 260,000 people. The first three countries in which persons were deported were Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. Hispanic or Latino (the terms used to refer to ethnic origin) can be of any race, including whites. In general, migrants were deported in 2018 to countries around the world, including Norway, Russia, Ireland, Kenya and China. (Here's the full list of countries where migrants have been deported) The Trump administration says that anyone in the country illegally is a priority for deportation. Our Facebook article said, \"You have not deported or detained an illegal white immigrant.\" The Facebook bulletin does not include a source of its claim. The ISI said it doesn't track the race of people removed from the country. Latin American countries were the main destinations where people were deported to 2018. Spanish or Latinos can be of any race, including eggs. According to news reports, white immigrants were arrested and expelled by the Institute during Trump &apos; s presidency.
