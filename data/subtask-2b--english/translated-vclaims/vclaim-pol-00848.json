Gary Farmer raised the case of medical marijuana card holders on the Senate floor. \"I was shocked to learn that some patients who are on kidney transplant lists or other organs are dropped from the list just because they appear to be licensed card holders under the database,\" said the farmer March 7. The farmer went on to say: \"It's one thing if you talk about moving lungs and smoking a commodity that would affect that member's survival. But patients who need a kidney or other cultivation should not be discriminated against simply because, once again, they exercise a legal medical option.\" (Joff) Ron Desantes signed a bill to allow medical marijuana smoking, which reflected the ban on smoking implemented by the legislature in 2017 following the adoption of a constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana in 2016.

How often do farming centres keep patients off transplant lists or remove them from lists because of medical marijuana? We found that it's happening, but we can't tell you how many times because of the lack of national data. We found some novels in the news reports, and we learned that they pushed at least half a dozen states to issue laws to help these patients. \"I am aware that such rejections were cases in California, Maine and Massachusetts,\" said Dr. Jordan Tichler, a cannabis medical expert, at Harvard University, Politifact. There are other wrinkles: the patient can be rejected because of an organ based on more than one factor, whether marijuana is a cause that can depend on the organ, or how much marijuana is used. Here's what we found. There is no national policy on whether medical marijuana users are prohibited from transplant lists, according to the United Organic Sharing Network, an organization that manages the State organ transplant system under a contract with the Federal Government. On June 5, 2011, Rick Scott stated in an interview on CNN that \"studies show that people who work in social welfare are more drug users than people who do not work in care.\" By Aaron Sharokman (June 9, 2011), these rules are determined by some 250 transplant centres. \"The rules vary from centre to centre and from member to member,\" said Arthur Kaplan, founding head of the Medical Ethics Division of the School of Medicine of the University of New York. \"I wouldn't say that most centres exclude people from using marijuana, but some do.\" A recent survey provides some evidence of patients &apos; rejection. The 2016 survey of AAA members, including agricultural doctors and support staff, was able to obtain some 225 responses (or 8 per cent of the members). Because the responses were anonymous, it was not known how many transplant centres had been included in the results. Almost 64 respondents said that their positions rejected all candidates regardless of the member if they were using marijuana, while 117 said that the Centre &apos; s policy varied according to the organ. The rest were unknown or not received. In order to learn more, we interviewed the spokespersons of five planting centres in Florida, the commemorative health of Jackson in Miami, Tampa General Hospital, the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, the Cleveland Weston Clinic, the Florida University of Health, as well as the University of California, San Francisco. They generally told us that transplant centres take into account the use of marijuana, including if a person uses marijuana excessively. However, decisions to evaluate applicants on the basis of marijuana use are made on a case-by-case basis - and there is no comprehensive ban on marijuana in their hospitals. The Miami Institute of Agriculture of the Jackson Health System, which conducted the second largest number of organ transplants in the country in 2018, described the assessment as complex. \"A multidisciplinary team assesses the patient's eligibility for transplantation on the basis of medical and surgical grounds, insurance, psychological and social criteria.\" \"We do not abandon patients who use medical marijuana, but we take this into account in their assessment of organ transplantation.\" A spokesman for Tampa General Hospital told us that the lung program would be the only program that would not include a patient using marijuana whether legal or illegal, but only if that patient was inhaling medicine. (In general, doctors may indicate that some patients using medical marijuana avoid smoking and swallow it in edible form or oil.) The hospital did not remove any patients from the waiting list because of the use of medical marijuana. The University of California Organic Agriculture Centre in San Francisco does not remove or deny a person only on the marijuana transplant list. However, if the use of marijuana or other substances undermines the patient &apos; s ability to work and reliably follows the prescription for dialysis and the use of medicines, this can put the patient on the transplant list at risk. Our ruling farmer said, \"Some patients on kidney transplant lists or other organs are dropped from the list just because they appear to be licensed card holders\" for medical marijuana. We found a paucity of national information to show how many times someone is kept off the transplant list as a result of marijuana abuse. However, what we found - including narrative reports from several states and some survey data - suggests that some patients were rejected from transplant lists because of their status as cardholders, as the farmer said. It's important to know that every transplant center sets its own rules. We're mostly assessing this statement right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4bb918cb-e17e-4369-a253-c47d3672ff10", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00848"}
