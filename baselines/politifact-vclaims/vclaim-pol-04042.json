For this fact-check, however, we wanted to focus on Trump\u2019s claim that the United States has spent $6 trillion on the wars.\nIs that right?\nWhat we found is that Trump confused what\u2019s been spent, and what is projected to be spent. That said, he\u2019s right to note the large cost of U.S. intervention in the Middle East.\nThe Congressional Research Service estimated in 2014 that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (mainly the cost of operations) had cost the United States about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\u2022 $686 billion for Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan)\n\u2022 $815 billion for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn\n\u2022 $27 billion for Operation Noble Eagle, enhancing security at military bases\n\u2022 $81 billion for programs and activities not directly related to war operations\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut those figures only include direct expenditures. More comprehensive analyses show trillions of dollars in additional spending.\nA recent Brown University study, for example, pinned the cost of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria at about $3.6 trillion from 2001 to 2016, using the $1.6 trillion operations costs as a baseline but also accounting for counterterrorism costs.\nAdding in money appropriated for war spending and on homeland security in 2017, the total reaches $4.79 trillion. This figure also includes future obligations for veterans medical and disability costs ($1 trillion through 2053) as well as interest on borrowing for wars.\nHere\u2019s a specific breakdown from the study:\n\u00a0\n\nA 2013 Harvard University working paper came up with an even higher cost: $4 trillion to $6 trillion for just Iraq and Afghanistan. Like the Brown study, the Harvard paper estimated that future medical care and disability benefits for veterans of these war will near $1 trillion.\nThe Harvard paper also attributes $750 billion in Pentagon medical and personnel costs to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and also considers the cost of nation-building in the two countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ruling\nTrump said the wars in the Middle East have cost $6 trillion dollars.\nTrump is citing the high-end estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet he is confusing money that\u2019s been spent with money that researchers say will be spent.\nThat\u2019s a $1 trillion difference or more.\nTrump\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b471a5a3-6b7d-4ec9-b8f2-f80cb9883425", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04042"}
