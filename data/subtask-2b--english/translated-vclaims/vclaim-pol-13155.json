On April 17, Houston Cronicle wrote Dick Armey: \"Incentives in our higher education system should attract the best professors and researchers in the world and provide our students with the best possible education. Let's start by allowing researchers to keep up to 90% of the research they produce instead of the 50% that is usually the maximum today. The disclosure of teachers' salaries would be another useful reform, along with the number of students they teach and the amount of funded research dollars they bring.\" \"At the University of Texas A&M, only 49 out of 3,000 faculty members have brought enough money to pay their salaries and public expenses over the past five years.\" Okay, we're bothered. Is this number true? With regard to our request for support, the spokesman for Freedom Works Adam Brandon stated by e-mail that the group was writing a detailed report explaining that \"great researchers should be rewarded for bringing them a lot of research dollars, rather than pulling them to support less productive researchers.\" Armi is headed by Freedom Workes, which says it mobilizes people for lower taxes, less government and more freedom. Brandon continued: \"The easiest calculation behind the envelope might be to assume that if the researcher had brought more funding than his salary, he would have \"paid for himself.\" To carry out a full cost analysis, you must overburden the compensation with overhead costs.\" Brandon said that the most recent information available, covering the year 2008, came from the Integrated Post-secondary Data System, which describes itself as a system of related surveys conducted annually by the Federal Government covering each college, university, technical and professional institution involved in financial aid programmes for federal students. Brandon said that the data was \"the basis of the analysis (Army) that only 49 researchers (A&M) paid for themselves.\" Brandon said that data from that system showed that for every dollar spent on the salaries of faculty members, the university spent money on public expenses. Thus, Brandon said, each dollar of research \"creates some extra costs elsewhere in the university.\" He said that, according to Aramie, every dollar of salary plus 25% to represent the cost of benefits should be paid $2.71 of overhead. \"The management of these accounts, we found that over a period of five years, only 49 researchers paid for themselves.\" We have unsuccessfully sought the details of the university's expenditure from Aramie to support his claim. Separately, an online search led us to articles published in September by the Bryan College Eagle Station on a report prepared by the University of Texas system A&M on the costs and contributions of faculty members in 2008-2009. As summarized in a press article on 15 September, the study was isolated \"What a teaching staff member generates through teaching - education paid by students and funding the formula by the State based on the weighted quarterly credit hours - subtracting the salary of the teaching staff member and the cost of the estimated benefits. It does not take into account the research dollars generated,\" the newspaper stated, although such information appears in a adjacent column. In a pre-detailed note, the A&M consultant, Michael McKinney, said that it showed that \"a college at each university generates revenues that exceed its payroll costs. The university literally means \"the note says. \"Our colleges work together, some study many university students, some study fewer graduate students, some provide new knowledge through research.\" When the report was released, it was criticized across the main campus of A&M, according to the eagle. Some complained about the results of research carried out by faculty members in the report, and some said that salaries were excessive. The newspaper quoted Jorge Vanegas, Dean of the Faculty of Architecture, saying that measurements prefer colleges that study more without calculating the function of Texas A&M as a research university. \"When the figures are taken from their full context and fed into misconceptions or lack of explicit recognition of what the entire academic spectrum should be, it causes a frustrating effect on the teaching staff,\" Vanegas said. The eagle reported that A&M had removed the report from the Internet, where a spokesman said that information on externally funded research was still being refined. A few days later, the president of the college campus, R. Bowen Loftin, sent an e-mail to the faculty stating that the results of the report would not be used to \"evaluate the overall productivity of the individual faculty member, and certainly would not talk about the quality of that productivity,\" as the newspaper stated. We obtained a copy of the report by requesting open recordings. Interest: One column in the graph shows the difference between the total funds generated by each teaching staff member and their salary costs. We quickly counted more than 49 faculty members who were born more than they had in the school year, in only the first three dozen academic departments of the university. Specifically, the report lists 21 colleges in agricultural leadership, education and communications; 17 colleges in agricultural economics; and 18 colleges in zoology - a total of 56 colleges - as net income generators. In those sections, 45 teachers were running in red, so to speak, according to the report. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, regime spokesman Jason Cook confirmed in an interview that the study did not attempt to determine the cost of overheads per teacher. \"I don't know how we can do that,\" he said. What about Armey's statement that only 49 faculty members at A&M have brought enough money to pay their salaries and public expenses over the past five years? Cook sent us an e-mail: \"We don't know how.\" Cook later said that the research referred to by the International Institute of Education by Freedom Works was useful in comparing A&M with other institutions, but could not be used to determine the number of faculty members who earned their wealth. The result: Unless we can access Army's data, we can't improve its methodology. In the meantime, our immediate examination of the recent Texas study A&M for teaching staff costs, which some critics said was less than the required number, indicates that more than 49 faculty members represented more than they cost in 2008-2009. We're assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13155"}
