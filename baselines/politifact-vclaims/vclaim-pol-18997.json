His campaign website said one-quarter of school children are Latino, but on the trail, Biden sometimes says about one-quarter of students are Latino and speak Spanish. Those two statements aren\u2019t the same, because not all Latino children speak Spanish.\u00a0\nWe asked Biden\u2019s campaign to provide evidence for the statistic.

In the United States, about 17% of all public school students speak Spanish, Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer and expert on immigration at the Pew Research Center told us.\u00a0\nPew researchers looked at the same 2018 data for Florida only, and found that about 24% of public school students speak Spanish at home (and most of those students are Hispanic). State Education Department data for the 2019-20 school year showed that about 20% of public school students speak Spanish as their native language.\u00a0\nNot all young Hispanics speak Spanish. Pew\u2019s 2016 national survey of Latinos found that English use is on the rise among young Hispanic people, but about 6 in 10 say they use Spanish.\nRELATED: Republicans and Democrats claim to support Dreamers.
