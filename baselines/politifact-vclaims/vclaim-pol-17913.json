Andrew Cuomo on Twitter.\nIn a May 7 tweet, Parlato shared a video she had made as part of her \"Table Talk\" series. In it, she spotlighted comments Cuomo had made about education during a May 5 press conference.\u00a0\nAccording to Parlato, Cuomo \"said gone are the days when we have one classroom with a teacher in the front. With all the technology we have, we don't need actual classrooms. He said we have the internet to teach our kids.\"\u00a0\nTable Talk: Have you heard @NYGovCuomo on NYS Education?! pic.twitter.com/fmvMNaXuoK\u2014 Beth Parlato for Congress (@BethforCongress) May 7, 2020 \nParlato, a lawyer and former judge, is running in the Republican primary for a seat in the suburbs of Buffalo and Rochester that was vacated in 2019 by Republican Chris Collins.\nDid Cuomo say what Parlato said he did? He said something close. But Parlato exaggerated some of his comments, and Cuomo later amended them.\nWhat did Cuomo say in his May 5 press conference?\nDuring Cuomo\u2019s May 5 daily press briefing, he addressed the effect the coronavirus pandemic was having on traditional education methods.\u00a0\n\"The old model of everybody goes and sits in the classroom and the teacher is in front of that classroom and teaches that class and you do that all across the city, all across the state, all these buildings, all these physical classrooms \u2014 why, with all the technology you have?\"\nCuomo said the internet has changed education and that traditional teaching practices may need to be reevaluated, especially considering how unprepared many districts were for online learning.\u00a0\nCuomo spoke about working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to \"reimagine\" education in New York state given the need for online learning during the pandemic. (Parlato also mentioned this in her video.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd on May 6, Cuomo asked Google\u2019s former CEO, Eric Schmidt, to help lead a new commission to redesign the state\u2019s educational systems.\nSo Parlato had a point that Cuomo was envisioning a future in which brick-and-mortar classrooms were less important. But she exaggerated somewhat. Cuomo didn\u2019t explicitly say he wanted to rule out traditional learning tactics or that \"we don\u2019t need actual classrooms.\"\u00a0\nIn fact, Cuomo talked about reopening schools in New York state once the pandemic has subsided enough to ensure safety.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s not about just reopening schools,\" Cuomo said in the May 5 press conference. \"When we are reopening schools, let\u2019s open a better school and let\u2019s open a smarter education system.\"\u00a0\nCuomo altered his stance after pushback\nCuomo\u2019s May 5 comments sparked a backlash from teachers, students and parents, with many interpreting Cuomo\u2019s message in the same way Parlato did. And in the weeks after Parlato sent her tweet, Cuomo backed off his comments.\n\"\u2018Reimagine education\u2019 means let's go through, let's look at what happened,\" Cuomo said on May 20. \"What can we learn that\u2019s positive? I would agree with the teachers who say, \u2018There is no substitute for classroom teaching.\u2019 There is no substitute.\"\nInstead, he said, \"what happened to us here was you couldn\u2019t do the classroom experience, because of the coronavirus, etc., so you have to go to remote learning. I don\u2019t believe every school district was ready for this abrupt shift to remote learning. And how could they be? Nobody was ready for this abrupt shift of this coronavirus.\"\nCuomo\u2019s office confirmed statements made at his May 5 and May 20 press conferences and didn\u2019t comment further on Parlato\u2019s video.\nOur rating\nParlato said Cuomo had said that \"with all the technology we have, we don't need actual classrooms.\"\nThat\u2019s close to what Cuomo said during his May 5 press conference, although Parlato left the impression that Cuomo was opposing reopening brick-and-mortar schools once the coronavirus pandemic is over, which is incorrect.\u00a0\nCuomo later walked back his comment amid a backlash from teachers, students\u00a0and parents.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17913"}
