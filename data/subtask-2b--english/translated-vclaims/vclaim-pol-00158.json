Harrison observed that although most health professionals were taught that the high BMI caused poor health outcomes, she wrote, \"Unfortunately, that's not true.\" She added: \"We have a wide range of issues associated with the high incidence of HIV/AIDS. However, the correlation does not prove causality, and there is a wide range of research that shows that the weight stigma and weight cycle can explain most if not all of the linkages that we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.\" We decided to check the point she was making, which is at the centre of a much more intense debate about whether excessive weight can be healthy at the same time - a perspective advocated by the \"health in every size\" movement, of which Harrison is a part. With approximately 72% of adults in the United States considered overweight or obese, this is an urgent issue. When we contacted Harrison to find out the basis of her statement, she responded quickly, citing two papers as major sources. The first, an article published in 2011 in Nutrition, says that it might be better to shift from weight loss efforts to health improvement in other weight neutral ways. She wrote her lead author, Linda Bacon, a professor at the University of California-Davis, \"Health at Every Size: The Surprise Truth About Your Weight,\" the book of 2010 adopted by fat-accepters. It addresses the first point of Harrison by this: \"while it is quite established that obesity is associated with increased risk for many diseases, causality is less entrenched.\" The other paper, an article in the magazine Obesity in 2014, provides similar arguments. The reason, the connection, the connection: let's say there's an old saw used by most statisticians: the connection is not equal to causality. But what does that mean? Let us use a false example: some people have difficulty seeing at night. It turns out all these people ate the carrots. Therefore, there can be a relationship between people who ate islands and those who suffered from night vision problems. This does not prove anything else, however, such as causality. The association is necessary when trying to determine causation, but it does not prove it. According to Dr. Samuel Klein, Director of the Human Nutrition Center at the University of Washington School of Medicine, St. Louis. In order to determine why, epidemiologists need more evidence. The best way, given the gold standard, is to allocate people randomly to one group or another to feed the group of islands and to block the islands from the other. The researchers will then monitor any difference in the number of people with night vision problems. That's neat, but it's not always possible or ethical. For example, some people cannot be randomly assigned to a group and then become more weighted. Instead, researchers use different types of studies, such as those comparing groups of people who already have characteristics, e.g., carrot eating or overweight, and those who do not know whether patterns are emerging. They use methods to control things that may affect outcomes, such as age, gender, income level, whether a person smokes, and other factors. Then they can assess the strength of the association or association they see. With smoking and lung cancer, very strong ties were seen, leading to the conclusion that smoking, yes, causes lung cancer. However, does excess weight cause other health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, sleep - loss of breath, or common problems? \"In the case of weight, unions are much weaker,\" said Kendrin Sunville, Associate Professor of Food Sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2012, the Henderson Statement stood. Current scientific research supports a correlation between overweight and poor health outcomes, but does not conclusively determine causality. But others, especially doctors, say there's no doubt that overweight increases the risk of such health problems. Dr. Harold Baez, Senior Scientific Officer of the Obesity Medicine Society, who represents practitioners who treat overweight patients, said. \"The overwhelming amount of clinical and scientific data supports obesity as a disease, both as a direct and indirect contributor to a large number of harmful metabolic and other health consequences,\" he said: For example, a scientific statement issued by the Endocrine Society in 2018 examined several studies on overweight and obesity and concluded that the two contributed to \"type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, kidney diseases, sleep-breathing muscles, bells, osteoporosis and primitive diseases, among other things.\" Then things get mysterious. Other experts agreed that some overweight people may not develop other conditions. \"It's quite true that not all cases of diabetes, hypertension, cancer and fat liver are caused by obesity,\" said Baze. They have admitted that people who fall into the category of obesity or overweight may also appear to be in a healthy metabolism at least for a period of time. But there's also a warning. \"If you're saying, \"Wait a minute, is sugar in their blood where we want it... not \"their threes are a little high and what about their blood pressure?\" That doesn't even mention the pain in the joints or the sleep break,\" said Baze. \"When you dig down, very few people really meet the criteria for being healthy too but fat, and if you follow them for five or 10 years, now the majority will have something.\" What about the stigma? There was less research on Harrison's second point: that most, if not all, of the diseases associated with obesity or overweight were due instead to the stigma faced by people, or the impact of yo-yo on nutrition, weight loss, and then again, in regular cycles. She referred to the paper presented by bacon that the weight cycle could lead to high blood pressure or high blood pressure. However, the research concluded that there were associations, although not a specific causal relationship. Similarly, in another study by Harrison, persons who reported weight discrimination of 6 per cent of the sample studied were twice as likely to be exposed to physiological stress for almost 10 years. The study stated that this stress could be associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. However, most of those with whom we spoke strongly challenged the overwhelming statement that many chronic situations could result from stigmatization and weight bike. While these can be a factor in health problems, they are not responsible for most of the health outcomes of her patients, as Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a doctor of obesity and assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Stanford also argues with lawyers who promote the idea that overweight is not a significant health risk factor. \"Health in every volume movement conflicts with what we know about obesity as a disease,\" Stanford said. \"The goal in that movement is not to learn science.\" The Governor Harrison said we had the idea that the highest BMI caused bad health outcomes \"just not right\" and added that \"We have a range of issues associated with BMIS height. However, the correlation does not prove causality, and there is a wide range of research that shows that the weight stigma and weight cycle can explain most if not all of the linkages that we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.\" In a strict reading of science, she has a point of view. It is very difficult to prove conclusively what causes the disease, and it turns out that \"relationship\" is a different result from causality. However, it appears to be applying this standard selectively, both to undermine the relationship between high HIV infection rates and poor health outcomes, and as evidence of the relevance of the weight and stigma cycle to certain chronic health conditions. However, in the case of obesity, researchers in multiple studies at the national and global levels have shown clear links between overweight and developing diseases, such as diabetes, and conditions, such as painful joints. There is much less evidence of the role of stigma and yo-yo in developing those medical problems, although experts urge further research into those issues. We appreciate Harrison's statement that it's mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00158"}
