(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nAll of the posts were published by people who have promoted QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that says Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles. QAnon supporters have claimed that Trump\u2019s hospitalization at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is actually a cover for mass arrests and executions of his political foes.\nThere is no evidence that\u2019s the case \u2014\u00a0and the Facebook posts are wrong to say that Trump is on Air Force One instead of staying at Walter Reed.\nThe posts rely on a mix of screenshots from QAnon accounts, photos of Trump and posts from Q, the anonymous internet persona behind the conspiracy theory. None of it proves Trump is on Air Force One. We reached out to the original poster for additional evidence, but we didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we know Trump is at Walter Reed? Here\u2019s a rough timeline of the president\u2019s status over the past few days.\nOn Oct. 2, Trump posted a video on Twitter shortly before departing the White House on Marine One. There is footage and photo evidence of him both leaving the White House and arriving at Walter Reed.\nOn Oct. 3, Trump\u2019s medical team held a press conference on the president\u2019s condition outside the hospital. Later in the day, Trump posted another video on Twitter thanking the healthcare workers at Walter Reed. The White House also released two photos that show Trump looking at documents or signing a piece of paper in the presidential suite at Walter Reed.\nRELATED:\u00a0Fact-checking misinformation about Trump, COVID-19\nOn Oct. 4, Trump\u2019s medical team gave another update on his condition outside the hospital. Dr. Brian Garibaldi, a pulmonary physician, said the president could be discharged as soon as Monday.\nA reporter for New York Magazine, Yashar Ali, debunked the claim that Trump wasn\u2019t really at Walter Reed. Tweeting a version of the Trump video, he wrote: \"I can't believe some of you conspiracy theorists are forcing me to do this, but a former USSS (Secret Service) agent who was on President Obama's detail has confirmed to me that this is indeed the larger office inside METU (Medical Evaluation & Treatment Unit) at Walter Reed.\"\nThere is also no evidence that Trump is faking his illness. That unfounded theory is outweighed by the significant amount of evidence showing that Trump does, in fact, have COVID-19.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
