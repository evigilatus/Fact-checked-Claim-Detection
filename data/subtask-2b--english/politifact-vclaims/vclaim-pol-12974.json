Batchelder says the consumers' council office has 74 lawyers on staff", "text": "Absent a dramatic reversal, the Office of the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel will be classified a budget loser once lawmakers finalize the state\u2019s two-year spending plan in the coming weeks.\n\nRepublican Gov. John Kasich and Republican lawmakers have taken direct aim at the office, which is charged with protecting Ohio consumers in utility cases.\n\nThe GOP-controlled House of Representatives supported Kasich\u2019s proposal to cut 51 percent of the agency\u2019s funding and added provisions to muzzle the office on issues related to natural gas markets and to eliminate the counsel\u2019s call center, a repository for consumer complaints.\n\nNational consumer groups sharply criticized the proposals, claiming they would prevent the office from fulfilling its mission.\n\nHouse Speaker William G. Batchelder, a Republican from Medina, was asked recently about the proposed cuts.\n\nBatchelder, echoing similar reasoning from Kasich, said the cuts are justified because the agency is overstaffed and because it plays a role similar to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.\n\nSupporters of the consumers\u2019 counsel say the office plays a watchdog role separate from the PUCO, which decides whether to approve rate increases the utilities propose.\n\n\"There are 74, I believe, attorneys in that office,\" Batchelder said on the Ohio News Network\u2019s \"Capitol Square\" on May 29. \"Is that duplicative? Is it wasteful? And I think since the legislature was busy with an axe on everything else, it makes it pretty hard to sell having the duplication or having 74 lawyers. I don\u2019t know how many the attorney general has.\"\n\nPolitiFact Ohio thought 74 seemed awfully high and decided to check out the speaker\u2019s claim.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long to conclude Batchelder was wrong.\n\nThe agency has a total of 82 employees, according to a staff listing the OCC provided. Of those workers, only 14 are attorneys. Some workers are part-time, meaning the office\u2019s staffing level equates to 72 full-time workers.\n\n\"We currently have 12 attorneys on staff assigned to case work and two vacancies. In addition to the 12 staff attorneys, the Consumers\u2019 Counsel Janine Migden-Ostrander and the Deputy Consumers\u2019 Counsel Bruce Weston are also attorneys,\" OCC spokeswoman Beth Gianforcaro wrote in an e-mail.\n\nOther departments at the OCC include the analytical department, communications, operations and the call center. Migden-Ostrander has said a 51 percent budget cut \u2013 from $8.5 million to $4.1 million, as Kasich and the House proposed \u2013 would result in layoffs and the elimination of the call center.\n\nBut cutting the agency\u2019s budget won\u2019t save the state money. The office is entirely funded from fees levied on the state\u2019s utilities, not tax dollars. Spending less money on the OCC would only put money back in the utilities\u2019 pockets.\n\nOn May 31, the Senate unveiled its budget proposal, which reduced the OCC\u2019s cut to 34 percent and removed the prohibition on the counsel talking about natural gas markets, which some called a \"gag order.\"\n\nA spokesman for Batchelder said the speaker misspoke about the number of attorneys in the office.\n\n\"He was trying to assert there were 74 employees at the office of the consumers\u2019 counsel and not 74 attorneys,\" Batchelder spokesman Mike Dittoe said. \"We apologize for the slip of the tongue there.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll allow that the speaker may have misspoke, rather than purposefully misused the statistics he cited. But he did repeat the inaccuracy, and wondered aloud how that number of lawyers compared with the staff of Attorney General Mike DeWine, Ohio\u2019s top lawyer. And the number itself is so overstated that it ecllipses the total staffing level of the consumers\u2019 counsel office.\n\nFurthermore, his complaint about duplication of services and wasteful spending when the state is \"busy with an axe on everything\" is misleading because funding for the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel doesn\u2019t come from general tax revenues. Rather, it is raised through fees levied on utilities.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio has noted before that as speaker, Batchelder is one of the most influential politicians in the state and Ohioans listen to what he says. In this case, he made the claim on a television broadcast on a statewide news network.\n\nAnd in this case his statement is not just inaccurate, but also makes a ridiculous claim.\n\nWhen that happens, the Truth-O-Meter points to one rating: Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12974"}
