  "vclaim": "In 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said: \"One of my proudest moments was when I told Obama, 'You will not fill this Supreme Court vacancy,'\" and in 2017, he said, \"Apparently there's yet a new standard now, which is not to confirm a Supreme Court nominee at all. I think that's something the American people simply will not tolerate.\""
