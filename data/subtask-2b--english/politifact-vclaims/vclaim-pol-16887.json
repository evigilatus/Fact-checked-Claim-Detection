The Chinese Communist Party is using Zoom as a way to spy on our citizens.\"\nStop using Zoom immediately.Any tech company that aligns with China must be ex-communicated from our countryThe Chinese Communist Party is using Zoom as a way to spy on our citizensRT! https://t.co/nylH3ltbgI\u2014 Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) April 3, 2020 \n\u00a0\nKirk\u2019s tweet cited an April 3 report from researchers at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab. The report spotlighted security problems using Zoom, but it didn\u2019t look at whether China was using the tech platform \"as a way to spy on our citizens.\"\n\"If (Kirk) is describing our findings as providing proof that the Chinese government is definitively spying on Zoom meetings, then that is inaccurate,\" said Bill Marczak, a senior research fellow at Citizen Lab and co-author of the report on Zoom\u2019s encryption.\nA spokesperson for Zoom told us the company, which is based in San Jose, California, is not aware of any efforts by China to use its platform for espionage. The FBI and Defense Department declined to comment.\nResearchers found security issues with Zoom\nIn their report, Marczak and co-author John Scott-Railton examined the encryption scheme protecting meetings hosted on Zoom.\u00a0\nThey found that Zoom \"uses non-industry-standard cryptographic techniques with identifiable weaknesses\" to safeguard its conferences. The app\u2019s encryption keys \u2014 long, random strings of characters used to protect encoded data \u2014 were sometimes routed through servers in China, even when all meeting participants are outside of China.\nThey wrote that this flaw is \"potentially concerning, given that Zoom may be legally obligated to disclose these keys to authorities in China,\" where they said the company employs roughly 700 people. The company\u2019s website says it has more than 2,000 employees worldwide.\nA spokesperson for Kirk cited these findings, news reports about them and China\u2019s history of surveillance and of spying on U.S. companies as evidence in support of Kirk\u2019s claim.\n\"It\u2019s well established that China is engaged in massive amounts of domestic surveillance and has established massive controls on any data that is routed to servers hosted in China \u2014 which is exactly what Zoom has done,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe Citizen Lab report did conclude that Zoom is \"not suited for secrets.\" It said governments, businesses concerned about cybercrime and espionage, health care providers, and activists, lawyers and journalists working on sensitive topics should all be especially careful.\nBut Kirk\u2019s tweet missed another conclusion that Zoom users may find reassuring.\n\"For those using Zoom to keep in touch with friends, hold social events, or organize courses or lectures that they might otherwise hold in a public or semi-public venue, our findings should not necessarily be concerning,\" Marczak and Scott-Railton wrote.\u00a0\nZoom is working to patch up security issues\nThe Citizen Lab\u2019s findings amplified concerns that have dogged Zoom as it has gained popularity.\u00a0\nOnline trolls have learned to invade meetings and project graphic material using Zoom's\u00a0screen-sharing feature, for example. The practice, known as \"Zoombombing,\" has led some school districts, including in New York City, to ban the platform for online learning.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom has since pledged to beef up its security. In a response to the Citizen Lab\u2019s report, CEO Eric Yuan said the routing of encryption keys through China was a \"misstep\" that resulted from Zoom\u2019s \"urgency to come to the aid of people around the world\" as the coronavirus spread.\u00a0\nThe routing problem has since been corrected, Yuan said, adding that it was never an issue for the separate version of Zoom available to government customers.\nThe company has also clarified its encryption practices, and Yuan said in another blog post that Zoom has paused extra features for 90 days so its engineers can focus on security fixes.\n\"Zoom has robust cybersecurity protection and a number of layered safeguards and built-in protections to help prevent unwanted meeting access,\" a company spokesperson told us.\nJames Andrew Lewis, director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said concerns about Zoom strike him as \"overstated.\"\n\"Zoom has development offices in China,\" he said. \"But its backroom functions are performed by an American cloud service provider using a very secure service located here in the U.S.\"\nMore people working from home is a \"goldmine for intel agencies\" that China will likely exploit, he said, but other technology companies may also face similar threats. The FBI recently issued a warning about cyber attacks that could come from the increased use of videoconferencing.\nKirk overstated the Citizen Lab\u2019s findings on China\nMarczak and Scott-Railton wrote that the problems they identified make Zoom \"a clear target to reasonably well-resourced nation state attackers,\" including China.\u00a0\nBut they never said China is spying on American citizens through Zoom, as Kirk claimed.\u00a0\n\"We found that the Chinese government could conduct this sort of surveillance, but our methodology cannot produce a finding one way or the other about whether this surveillance is actually occurring,\" Marczak told PolitiFact.\nHe said their goal was to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited, not to catch bad actors.\n\"China is capable of conducting this kind of surveillance,\" he said. \"The question is whether they are actually doing it. If they are doing it, ordinary people are unlikely to be targets.\"\nOther cybersecurity experts agreed that China would not likely target the average American.\n\"I would suspect that if Chinese intel agencies are taking advantage of Zoom vulnerabilities, and I assume they are, they are targeting government users and business users,\" said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.\u00a0\nIn past Chinese hacks involving information on ordinary American citizens \u2014 including attacks on Marriott and Equifax \u2014 the hackers were after big data sets that could be used to spot patterns in people who might be willing to spy on China\u2019s behalf, Segal said.\n\"You might be able to pull those things out of Zoom calls, but it would take much more work and be less reliable,\" he said.\nIt\u2019s also unlikely that China would be monitoring every U.S.-based Zoom call because of the money and manpower needed to do so, experts told us.\u00a0\n\"In practice, the cost to do this should be high enough that China wouldn't want to use this as a mass surveillance tool, but rather a tool for targeted surveillance,\" Marczak said.\nOur ruling\nKirk said, \"The Chinese Communist Party is using Zoom as a way to spy on our citizens.\"\nThe claim is based on a report from researchers at the University of Toronto. But one of the researchers told us that while they identified security issues with Zoom, whether China has exploited the platform for espionage was not something they considered.\nChina is likely capable of using Zoom for spying, experts told us.\u00a0It\u2019s not implausible that the country has tried using it to target governments, businesses and others with sensitive information.\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t know whether China has done so. But there\u2019s no proof that it has. A spokesperson for Zoom said the company isn\u2019t aware of efforts by China to tap into meetings on the platform, and experts said most ordinary Americans shouldn\u2019t have any reason to worry.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16887"}
