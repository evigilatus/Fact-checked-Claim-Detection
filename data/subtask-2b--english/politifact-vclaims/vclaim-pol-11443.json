U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republican from Wisconsin who has won kudos from some deficit hawks, is churning out essays and press releases on it.\n\nAnd Georgia\u2019s U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, is putting his own spin on the subject. \u00a0\n\n\"I find it very troubling that the president is asking to increase the nation\u2019s debt limit when his Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days,\" Isakson said in a Jan. 26 press release.\n\nThat\u2019s about three years.\n\nWe grabbed our calculator and got to work with the help of our sister sites PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, who have analyzed other claims on the same subject.\n\nBut before we proceed with our fact check, it helps to explain how Congress comes up with its federal budget.\n\nThis is how it works: Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years.\n\nIf these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.\n\nIf a budget resolution doesn\u2019t pass, the federal government won\u2019t go dark.\n\nBudget resolutions are distinct from appropriations bills, which actually allocate how the federal government spends its money. \u00a0If a resolution tanks, the majority party can use congressional procedures to move forward to consider appropriations bills.\n\nAs a previous PolitiFact National story said, \"the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.\"\n\nNow, on to our fact check. Thanks to PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, we have a good sense of whether Isakson\u2019s claim is accurate.\n\nLast year, George LeMieux, a Republican contender for U.S. Senate in Florida, posted on Twitter that it had been 750 days since his opponent and Senate Democrats \"passed\" a budget.\n\nLeMieux was referring to the last time the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, passed a budget resolution.\n\nIndeed, the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution was in 2009 for the 2010 fiscal year, according to a report on the budget process by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nPolitiFact Florida rated this statement Half True. The candidate got the number of days right, but placing the blame on Senate Democrats wasn\u2019t fair. Partisans on both sides share responsibility.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to Jan. 23, about 250 days after LeMieux made his statement. Ryan, the Republican House member from Wisconsin, said Senate Democrats \"have gone without any budget at all\" for more than 1,000 days.\n\nRyan\u2019s language could have been more precise, PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled. It had been that long since a budget resolution passed, but not since the last Senate budget resolution expired. He earned a Mostly True.\n\nIsakson uses somewhat different wording from Ryan and LeMieux. He said that the Democratic majority in the Senate has failed to \"submit\" -- not pass -- a budget in the past 1,000 days.\n\nDemocrats did submit a budget resolution since the last resolution passed, though it never went before the full Senate for a vote. \u00a0\n\nWe took a look at the Congressional Record, the official record of Congress\u2019 proceedings.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, under the heading \"Submitted Resolutions,\" is S. Con. Res. 60, introduced by Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. He\u2019s a Democrat and head of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nThe resolution would have set forth the budget for 2011, but the Senate took no action after its date of submission. \u00a0\n\nA resolution is \"submitted\" when its author formally presents it to the house of which he or she is a member, according to Congressional Quarterly\u2019s American Congressional Dictionary, a widely used authority on language used in Congress. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nInstead of passing a typical budget resolution for 2011, Democrats passed one that would last for a single year. They said that they were waiting for a fiscal commission created by President Barack Obama to make its recommendations for debt reduction, according to news accounts at the time.\n\nIn an email, Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson described Conrad\u2019s submission of the budget resolution as a \"gimmick.\"\n\n\"It was never reported out of committee. It was never brought to the floor. It was not debated for even one hour,\" the email said.\n\nFederal law limits debate on a budget resolution to 50 hours.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled Senate didn\u2019t put a budget resolution up for a vote last year. And according to news accounts, they don\u2019t intend to put one up this year, either.\n\nIsakson\u2019s claim that the \"Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days\" needs some revision.\n\nNo budget has been passed in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. None has been put up for a vote in that time, either. But one was submitted April 26, 2010, or 640 days before Isakson issued his press release.\n\nThat said, this flaw in Isakson\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t undermine his larger point. The budget resolution for 2011 languished. It never went up for a vote, and Democrats haven\u2019t submitted one since. In the past few years, Senate Democrats have taken limited action on budget resolutions.\n\nThe statement contains a kernel of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It meets our definition of Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Keown\n\n\nstated on August 12, 2010 in his campaign Web site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is wrong for the average federal worker today to make more than $100,000 while the average private-sector worker makes less than $70,000.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Stirgus \u2022 August 18, 2010", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11443"}
