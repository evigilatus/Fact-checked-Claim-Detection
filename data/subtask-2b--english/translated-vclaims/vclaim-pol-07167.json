One allegation from the current Mr. Democratic Jean Shahin has drawn our attention. Shaheen is facing a challenge from former Republican Sin, Scott Brown. In a newsletter from her campaign, Shaheen said: \"I have always supported women's right to choose because I know that women should make health-care decisions in consultation with their doctors and families, not with their employers. Scott Brown &apos; s record is clear: when calculated, he does not defend women &apos; s reproductive rights and economic security. He co-sponsored legislation allowing employers to deny women coverage of birth control or even mammography. New Hampshire women cannot trust Brown Scott, and his record shows that he is wrong for New Hampshire. We've noticed two related allegations, but they're specific enough to analyse them separately. First, did the legislation in question allow employers to deny women coverage in the area of birth control? Would employers have been allowed to refuse mammography coverage? We've heard about differences about birth control, but not mammograms. So we decided to check it out. (We have addressed the issue of birth control in a separate examination of the facts.) The mammography is used to detect breast cancer, either preventively in women without signs of illness, or as diagnostic assistance after reporting the existence of a mass or other symptoms, according to the National Cancer Institute. In a different Shaheen campaign newsletter, the campaign explained its sources by writing, \"FACT: Scott Brown: Co-sponsored and voted for Blunt Amendment, which allows employers to deny women access to a range of health-care services, including contraceptives and mammography coverage.\" The amendment in question was proposed by Mr. Roy Blunt of the Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea. The draft resolution - i.e., its elimination - was submitted by a vote of 51-48, in which a simple majority was required. Of those who voted \"nai\" -- that is, those who wanted to keep it under consideration -- Brown was, and then represented Massachusetts in the Senate. He also co-sponsored a previous measure, S.1467, the Respect for the Rights of Conscientious Persons Act 2011. The Shahin camp is therefore right that Brown acted in support of this measure. But what did the amendment say? It has expanded the scope of acceptable procedures to exclude provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for religious or moral reasons. It focuses on the mandates under the Act for preventive services, which is called the \"basic health benefit package.\" The Shaheen campaign referred to a news release on February 29, 2014, opposing the Blunt amendment by the Cancer Action Network of the American Cancer Society. The release said, \"The expansionary nature of the proposed Blunt amendment... could lead to a refusal to cover life-saving preventive services such as mammography or cessation of smoking based on the employer's discretion.\" However, we do not accept the advocacy group &apos; s claim without further examination. So we read the relevant parts of the law ourselves. We agree that this provision has been broadly drafted. It does not target abortion or birth control -- it simply says that employers cannot be asked to cover \"specific objects or services\" \"in conflict with the religious or moral beliefs of the guarantor, source or any other entity offering the plan.\" So, presumably, any aspect of preventive care can be qualified to choose between religious conscience -- including mammography. Or, in this matter, headphones or tongue depression. We cannot imagine any religious objections to the use of tongue inhibitors. But what about mammography? On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. \u2022 15 January 2021, we asked a number of medical and bioethics experts whether they had ever heard religious objections raised about mammography. No one said they did it. \"I did not hear this allegation in the specific context I described,\" said Paul A. Lombardo, a medical and ethical specialist at the State University of Georgia. Adam Sunfield, a senior policy partner at the Guttmacher Institute, noted that the opposition of Supreme Court Judge Ruth Bader Jensburg of the Hobei community referred to religious objections to blood transfusions (by Jehovah's Witnesses), antidepressants (by Scientologists), pig drugs, including anesthesia, vein fluids, gelatinized pills (by Muslims, Jews and Hindus) and vaccines (by Christian scientists). However, Sunfield could not remember the objections made to mammography. The opposition to mammography will also be news of a leading anti-abortion group, the National Commission on the Right to Life. \"I have never heard of any argument being made against mammography on the basis of conscientious objection,\" said Susan T. Musket, chief legislative adviser in the group. Arthur Kaplan, Director of Medical Ethics at the Langon Medical Center at the University of New York, said as soon as possible \"to make any sense of\" the claim involves what in the pool game can be known as a multiple bank shot. Family planning has become the target of anti-abortion activists because they perform abortions, but group clinics also provide other forms of health care for women. These include breast screening, but not breast screening per se. If the clinic determines that the patient needs breast examination, it will be referred to the health-care provider who provides one. Some anti-abortionists may \"see this as a trick,\" Kaplan said. \"There may therefore be a doctor or nurse who refuses breast referral from family planning on the grounds that it is merely funding abortion.\" But this is all a guess, Kaplan added. He said, \"No doctor I know has any problem with mammography.\" Holly Fern\u00e1ndez Lynch, Harvard University life ethicist and author of conscientious conflicts in health care: an institutional compromise, the prosecution called \"technically correct,\" but \"a bit of kashman.\" Could it have been used to block access to mammography? \"Yes,\" she said. Was that it? Of course not. I've never heard of a religious or moral objection to mammography. The best examples are contraception, abortion, vaccines (especially HIV), psychological care or palliative care.\" Our Governor Shaheen said that Brown co-sponsored legislation that would allow employers to deny women coverage of mammograms. The amendment, which was supported by Brown, has been drafted sufficiently to allow religious conscience to choose not to adopt almost any form of preventive care. But he didn't aim for mammography as I pointed out. While the amendment would have protected the objections of religious conscience, we failed to reveal any evidence that mammography had inspired religious opposition, either now or in the past. The prosecution contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We assess the claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07167"}
