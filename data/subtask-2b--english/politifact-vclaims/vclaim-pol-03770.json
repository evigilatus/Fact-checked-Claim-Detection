Cox, the chairman of the New York State Republican Committee, took exception when Gov. Andrew Cuomo said \"the exodus has stopped\" in New York state.\n\"He said there is no exodus, we\u2019ve stopped the exodus. Wrong \u2013 completely wrong,\" Cox said to reporters in Albany. \"The exodus of citizens from New York state has been growing, it\u2019s never been larger. That\u2019s an absolute fraudulent statement the governor made, that the net exodus of citizens from New York state has been stopped under his regime. Absolutely wrong. That\u2019s a lie and he knew it was.\"\nIs Cox right? Are more people moving out of New York state than moving in?\nCuomo\u2019s comment\nThe problem with Cox's statement, according to a Cuomo spokesman, is that Cox misinterpreted what the governor said during his regional State of the State address in Buffalo.\nCuomo said:\u00a0\"So we got the spending down. It allowed us to get the taxes down, and that\u2019s why you see a new attitude where businesses believe they\u2019re welcome in New York, families believe they\u2019re welcome in New York. The exodus has stopped, the job growth has started.\"\nCuomo's statement left room for interpretation, but PolitiFact New York evaluated that claim in July 2016 and rated it True.\u00a0\n\nSource: New York State Department of Labor\nCensus data\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCox interpreted Cuomo's statement as about people. The U.S. Census Bureau tracks how many people move in and move from states each year.\nBetween April 2010 and July 2016, the latest data available, 846,669 more people moved out of New York state than moved in. That's the largest outflow in the country.\u00a0\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau\nThe state\u2019s population increased by 367,719 people in the same time period thanks to births and international migration.\nCuomo took office in January 2011. Leaving out\u00a0data between July 2010 and July 2011 still leaves the state with a net domestic migration loss of about 723,000 between 2011 and 2016.\nThe exodus from New York state is not new. The trend goes back decades.\nOur ruling\nCuomo and Cox are like ships passing in the night. Cuomo's statement was previously rated True. And Cox's version of the statement - '\"the exodus of citizens from New York state has been growing\" - is verified by census data.\nWe also rate Cox's claim as True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4390d3e2-ddd7-476a-94ce-072de6842156", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03770"}
