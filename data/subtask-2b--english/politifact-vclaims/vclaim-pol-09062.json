But porn aside, there was a lot to check out here.\nWe contacted David McGuinn, president of Safe Deposit Specialists, a financial consulting firm that offers training, products and services to the financial industry. He told us he was flooded with phone calls when this claim resurfaced in 2013. He attributes it to the Cyprus financial crisis earlier this year.\nThe small Mediterranean country had been in severe recession since 2009, and a banking crisis led to a rescue package from the European Central Bank. The terms of the bailout left the government desperate for cash, so officials announced in March that they would seize a portion of savers\u2019 assets.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

McGuinn said this process doesn\u2019t occur frequently.\nAnd when officials do open safe deposit boxes, there are safeguards in place.\nRob Rowe, vice president with the American Bankers Association, explained that good cause must be proven in order for the Patriot Act to be used to open a safe deposit box, which is private property. The email in question cited the Patriot Act as the reason the DHS can seize this property, but Rowe said that isn\u2019t the case.\nAlso, DHS officials wouldn\u2019t be able to open up boxes without bank officials present, he said.\n\"The only way to open the box without the renter\u2019s key is to drill the lock. If and when a box is drilled, standard bank operating procedures require dual control \u2013 the presence of two officers \u2013 and many jurisdictions also require that the locksmith who drills the box to be specially licensed or certified,\" Rowe said.\nWhen we contacted Homeland Security about the issue, an official cited the Fourth Amendment, explaining that searches and seizures by the department may only take place with probable cause and a court-ordered warrant.\nOur ruling\nVarious chain emails over the past seven years have warned readers about the possibility of Homeland Security seizing items like gold, silver and guns from their safe deposit boxes at the bank. This\u00a0isn\u2019t possible without first obtaining a search warrant, since those boxes are private property. And banking officials told us random seizures just aren\u2019t happening.
