And when the woman in the ad returns to speaking in the present tense -- \"That won\u2019t protect my family\" -- the ad leaves a misleading impression of Cruz\u2019s current positions.\nSetting the table\nA few notes up front:\n\n\nGreat America PAC, founded in February 2016 and formerly known as TrumPAC, didn\u2019t respond to our requests for information to support the ad\u2019s claim.\n\n\n\n\nA Cruz campaign spokesman told us that on immigration, the senator never backed amnesty and that on Syrian refugees, he never backed an increase in the numbers.\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker gave the ad two Pinocchios -- its rating for a claim that has \"significant omissions and/or exaggerations.\" Our evaluation was similar.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Wanted to let in more Syrian refugees\u2019\nAs reported during the presidential campaign by the Huffington Post, Cruz in 2014 expressed support for allowing Syrian refugees into the United States. He said in a Fox News report on Syrian refugees (as shown in a video is on Cruz\u2019s own Senate web page):\n\"We have welcomed refugees \u2014 the tired, huddled masses \u2014 for centuries. That\u2019s been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so.\" He added: \"We have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists, but we can do that.\"\nThe Fact Checker found in reviewing other Cruz statements in 2014 that he was not a particularly vocal advocate for accepting more refugees, but he supported the idea.\nAfter the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, Cruz changed course, seeking to ban Syrian refugees who are Muslim from entering the United States.\nWanted to \u2018give amnesty to illegal immigrants\u2019\nSome consider amnesty to be anything less than deporting all illegal immigrants, while others think of amnesty as letting immigrants stay with no punishment or additional requirements.\nBoth the Fact Checker and FactCheck.org found it impossible to sort out Cruz\u2019s position on the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill from the so-called Gang of Eight.\nFactCheck.org noted that one Cruz amendment to the bill would have stripped out a proposal for a path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally -- but, purposefully, also left intact provisions to provide legal status for them.\nAnd the Fact Checker pointed out that Cruz introduced five amendments to the bill, including one that expanded legal immigration, and gave passionate speeches in support of his amendments. Cruz now contends his amendments were meant as a \"poison pill\" to kill the bill, which ultimately fell apart.\nBut as the Fact Checker observed, \"there\u2019s no way to prove which version of the story is the truth; what we can say is that Cruz was being disingenuous then or disingenuous now.\"\nAs for now, Cruz is adamantly against amnesty.\nOur rating\nGreat America PAC says Cruz \"wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to illegal immigrants.\"\nCruz in 2014 supported continuing to allow Syrian refugees into the United States and in 2013, he appeared to back measures to give legal status to illegal immigrants. At the same time, the political action committee\u2019s ad suggests those positions are current ones, when they aren\u2019t.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.\n\u00a0https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84579ab4-4915-4d6f-b127-4fd5f9fd9bb7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05060"}
