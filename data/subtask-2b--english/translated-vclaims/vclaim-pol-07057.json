Scott Walker adopts Mary Burke &apos; s criticism of the growth of jobs in the private sector, which has fallen behind the national average during his period of control. \"Before we take office, policies supported by my opponent cost Wisconsin 133,000 jobs,\" says Walker in the television commercial, which first appeared in October 22, 2014. \"We've set a high target to create 250,000 jobs because I know Wisconsin can do great things.\" With only two months remaining in his tenure, employment in the private sector increased by 111,000, or about 44 per cent of the figure promised by the Republican Governor of 250,000. The \"big goal\" statement is part of Walker's effort in recent weeks to offer his promise of 250,000 jobs as bold and aggressive, while comparing it to the dark days of the Great Recession. We have previously reviewed Walker &apos; s claim that the policies of his predecessor, Jim Doyle (who appointed Burke as his trade minister), caused the loss of 133,000 jobs in the second state of the Democratic Governor from 2007 to 2010. We've often misjudged that. The number is accurate, but the national recession was the main cause, not any particular governor. In fact, Wisconsin's performance was somewhat better than that of the rest of the country during that major contraction. In any case, Burke left the state government before the recession started. However, what about Walker's claim that the 250,000 promise was \"a great goal \"? \"Big,\" of course, is an inaccurate word. But what Walker's talking about has a clear statistical basis. That is, we can compare its goal - and the growth it required to achieve it - with the growth of employment in the past four years, both in raw terms and as a share of the private sector's job base at different times. In the 2010 race, Walker's opponents made more modest promises. The Republic of Mark Newman, who defeated Walker at the elementary level, has pledged 300,000 jobs in 10 years. The Mayor of Milwaukee Tom Barrett, who was defeated by Walker in the general election, promised 180,000 in three years -- a step slightly slower than Walker's pledge. Shortly after the Walker election in November 2010, the biennial reporter in the newspaper Milwaukee found that \"most of the recovery since the Second World War has produced the growth rate of jobs needed to achieve the Walker goal.\" But \"most\" is not everything, and the November 2010 story indicated that the unusually slow growth of employment has been marked by the last two recessions - which occurred in the early 1990s and the great recession, which officially lasted from 2007 to 2009. The recovery after the recession in 2001 received the name \"unemployed recovery.\" \"But this one,\" the economist John Heywood said at the time, referring to the Great Recession, \"is to put this one for shame.\" On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women have gained employment. In the history of Nosiapa Mezan - January 15, 2021, a somewhat different view came from the retired chief economist, Terry Ludman, who said that normal recovery must, of course, be restored to job losses during recession. We decided to check our own recent history, starting with the Republican Government. The first term of office of Tommy Thompson in 1986. Finally, during the 2010 campaign, Walker cited this term as an inspiration for his goal of 250,000 people. We relied on quarterly employment data reported by the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics and found that private employment increased by 233,000 in the first Thompson period. That was the sign of high water in any administration since then -- or in any four-year period since 1986, regardless of whether it corresponds to the Governor's mandate. The closest was in 1991-1995 (232,000). The Walker target has therefore exceeded actual performance over the past quarter century, at least in the initial number of added posts. From the perspective, the number of periods we have experienced since 1990 in six of the 24 periods when job growth has reached the highest 200,000 over four years. It should be noted that when Walker made his promise in 2010, the previous two periods were negative for growth, starting from 2004-2008 (-6800) and 2005-2009 (146000). When he made a promise in early 2010, the Great Depression had officially ended and massive job losses had stopped, but Wisconsin was still losing its jobs on a monthly basis. So reaching the target of 250,000 was far from the lock. But there's another way to look at these numbers. Economies grow over time, and the labour base was one third lower in the 1980s than it was when Walker made his promise. This means that when 233,000 jobs were added in the first Thompson period, that was actually a better percentage growth than Walker assumed when pledging. The Liberal Center for Wisconsin Strategy summarized its view in this way: \"Well, there certainly are a lot of jobs. But let's keep that in perspective. The population has increased by about 2 per cent since the onset of the recession. To get a job back to the pre-recession level, we need to create over 270,000 jobs.\" Our evaluation of Walker took pictures of him promising 250,000 jobs as a major target. The growth rates required in the post-deflation period to make this number happen were not uncommon after the Second World War. However, this was not the case during the last recovery process, at which time Walker made a promise that was about 15 years since the State experienced steady growth at this pace. Initially, the amount of 250,000 of the expected gains was higher than the actual gains over any four-year period since at least the mid-1980s. We assess his claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07057"}
