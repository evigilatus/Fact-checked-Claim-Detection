But some Facebook users accused Democrats of a similar uprising in 2018.\nOn Feb. 4, Ted Nugent, a singer-songwriter and conservative activist, shared a photo of people crowded into a rotunda.\n\"Remember when Democrat protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol in 2018, took over the U.S. Senate building, and tried to get into the U.S. Supreme Court during the (Brett) Kavanaugh confirmations?\" says text in the image. \"Democrat legislators and the MSM cheered it on. If it wasn\u2019t for double standards liberals would have no standards at all.\"\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The meme has been shared in dozens of other public Facebook posts, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.\nThere were demonstrations at the U.S. Capitol and nearby buildings during the Kavanaugh hearings, which drew protests after the nominee was accused of sexual assault.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the photo Nugent posted doesn\u2019t show that. It shows protesters in the Wisconsin state capitol building nearly a decade ago.\nIn mid-February 2011, tens of thousands of demonstrators protested in Madison, Wis., against Republican legislation aimed at removing the collective bargaining rights of an estimated 300,000 workers. Many crowded into the capitol building itself and, by Feb. 20, 2011, some demonstrators had begun a physical occupation of the building.\nThe photo in Nugent\u2019s Facebook post is similar to one taken Feb. 18, 2011, by Mary Bottari of the Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal nonprofit organization. It shows protesters crowded onto three floors in the Wisconsin Capitol rotunda. Unlike the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, the 2011 protests were largely peaceful.\u00a0\nWatch more footage of the demonstrations below:\n\nIn 2018, hundreds of people protesting Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation were arrested after gathering in Senate buildings and galleries, including the Russell Senate Office Building rotunda. Others were charged with \"crowding, obstructing, or incommoding\" the East Front steps of the Capitol building.\nBut a photo Nugent relies on to show that Democrats \"stormed\" the U.S. Capitol doesn\u2019t show any of that.\nWe rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19075"}
