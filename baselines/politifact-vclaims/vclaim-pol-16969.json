It\u2019s as fake today as it was a year ago when it was first published on a website that describes its content as satire.\u00a0\n\"Nancy Pelosi\u2019s 4th Husband Files for Divorce: \u2018I Just Can\u2019t Take It Anymore,\u2019\" reads the headline on an April 14, 2020, story on a site called Maga20 News.\nThe article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe entire article was lifted from a satirical story published in 2019.\nSatirical site\nThe same headline, and the same article, were previously posted on tatersgonnatate.com with this tag: \"Pelosi's Satirical Bout with Alcoholism.\"\u00a0\nThe article includes clues that it is satirical, such as its claim that one of the House speaker\u2019s former husbands is Marsellus Wallace. He was the gang boss character played by Ving Rhames in the movie \"Pulp Fiction.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe About Us tab\u00a0on the taters website says the site \"is a subsidiary of the America\u2019s Last Line of Defense network of parody, satire and tomfoolery.\" PolitiFact has\u00a0written\u00a0about that website and its faux-news creator, Christopher Blair.\nThough the tatersgonnahate.com story does not have a date of publication attached to it, Lead Stories fact-checked the original article, reporting that it was satire, on March 31, 2019, saying the article had been posted 10 days earlier.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s more than a year before the article we\u2019re checking was posted.\nPelosi and her husband, Paul Pelosi, a businessman in real estate and venture capital, have been married since 1963. The California Democrat has never divorced. And there is no indication she is divorcing now. A Pelosi spokesman called it \"fiction.\"\nOur ruling\nAn April article claiming that Pelosi\u2019s fourth husband is filing for divorce is a reprint of an article from more than a year earlier from a website that publishes satire.\nPelosi has been married to the same man since 1963 and has never divorced.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16969"}
