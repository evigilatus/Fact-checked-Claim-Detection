Ron Johnson, R-Wiss, said. \"There's a survey conducted in Guatemala. One third of Guatemalans intend to migrate to the United States, \"Johnson said in an interview on July 21, about the state of the Union in CNN. \"This is about 5.8 million people. The elimination of the population of Guatemala and Central America is not good for Central America. It's not good for us.\" Did a survey indicate that about one third of Guatemalans.................................................................................................................................................................................... No. Johnson &apos; s claim is based on news reports that transmitted the results of the survey inaccurately. Johnson refers to an article in the Guatemalan newspaper Johnson's Press Political Fact to a post on the Senator's website entitled \"How many people will come here under open borders?\" It was published the following day to meet CNN. \"39.2% of Guatemalans told the pollers that they intended to migrate abroad, and 85% of those who said that they would migrate to the United States,\" said Johnson's article, which reflected the publication of the Brinsa Libre newspaper in May. Johnson also cited American copies of the story by the Washington examiner and daily caller. Johnson has a point of view: many Guatemalans have said they intend to leave their country. \"But the exact numbers are different,\" said Professor Elizabeth G. Zekemeister, Director of the Latin American Public Opinion Project at Vanderbilt University. Its group worked with a Guatemalan research institute and think tank for the preparation of the national survey of the scale of the Americas in Guatemala. From 22 January to 20 March 2019 face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1,596 individuals. The sample was nationally representative of Guatemala &apos; s adult population, aged 18 years and over. The survey asked participants whether they had any intention of going to or working in another country over the next three years. In response, about 25 per cent said yes. This is much lower than the percentage of almost 40 percent cited by Johnson. The people who said yes were then asked about the possibility that they would live and work in another country in the next three years; 39.2 per cent said \"very likely.\" So 39% is a subset of 25% of Guatemalans who say they intend to leave their country. This specific set of questions did not ask where they were going. In a tweet on May 6, the Vanderbilt research team said that it wanted to clarify the reports of Brenissa LeBrie, indicating exactly what the percentages correspond to. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverde: 3 February 2021 ACLARCION: Queremos prescisar la Inferaci\u00f3n publicada por @prensa_libre. 25.3 per cent of the Guatemalan population 25.3%, Apnas 39.2% cee que es my que lo haga en lo proximos 3 Anios. @ASIES_GT: https://t.co/QrgL6yFAnw pic.twitter.com/Bsq3lEvi3X-LAPOP (@Lapop_Barometro) 6 May 2019 in general, it is estimated that about 10% of Guatemala's adult population has a major motive for leaving the country, tell Zecmeister Politifact. \"This is, per cent that both express intention to migrate in the next three years and suggest that they are very likely to do so,\" she said. It was not asked what intention it was to go to United States Guatemalans who said that their departure in the future was \"very likely\" if the United States was a deliberate destination. A separate survey question asked whether respondents over the past 12 months have considered immigration; 17.2% replied \"Yes.\" He then asked those who said yes an open question about where they looked at immigration, 85 per cent of whom said that the United States was. So about 14.6% of survey respondents said that in the last 12 months they've looked at immigration to the United States, as Zekemeister said. :: Polyte Factor Zicmester asked how many Guatemalans planned to come to the United States - because Johnson said about 5.8 million people. \"I'm not comfortable saying there's a specific number \"right,\" said Zekemeister. \"This would be easier if we asked the question directly -- do you intend to migrate to the United States next year? However, since we have not done so, attempts to use our data to answer this question will require some assumptions, and depending on what they are, there are a set of answers that one can generate to the question.\" Johnson also referred to the survey in the context of a conversation on irregular migration. However, the survey did not ask people whether they intended to migrate legally or illegally. Our Governor Johnson said, \"There's a survey conducted in Guatemala. One third of Guatemalans intend to migrate to the United States. This is about 5.8 million people.\" A survey of Guatemalans showed that many of them intended to leave their country, and some data indicated that the United States was a significant destination. However, Johnson's estimates are based on media reports that inaccurately presented the results of the polls. Somehow using the survey that Johnson did requires assumptions that go beyond evidence. Johnson reiterated poor information on the results of the survey. We assess the claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00391"}
