The \"chalking\" incident ignited a campus protest where some students expressed \"pain\" and rabid paranoia in wake of the serial pro-Trump scribblings.\nThe protesters were immediately pilloried from the right and left as a bunch of coddled whiners. One part of the news stories and viral social media posts caught PolitiFact\u2019s attention. Many of the reports said the offended students were provided counseling to ease their PTSD \u2014 Post Trump Scribbling Disorder.\n\nSay it ain\u2019t so. Well, PolitiFact Georgia discovered it mostly ain\u2019t.\nThe trouble began when a yet-to-be-identified person(s) wrote pro-Trump slogans in chalk on sidewalks, steps and railings on the campus. Horrified students awoke to the madness and quickly noted Trump\u2019s penchant for the politically controversial. Trump has advocated deporting all illegal immigrants and banning Muslims from entering the U.S.\nThe student newspaper, The Emory Wheel, reported that about 40 students soon staged a campus protest, at one point shouting to the school\u2019s administration: \"You are not listening! Come speak to us, we are in pain!\" Then students moved into the administration building calling out: \"It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.\"\nCritics saw the incident as political correctness run amok at an institution that is supposed to promote free speech and a diversity of ideas.\nThe pundits pounced. The story was carried across the globe. Left-leaning comedian Bill Maher said this: \"I so badly want to dropkick these kids into a place where there is actual pain and suffering.\"\nLarry Wilmore fired off a brutal Comedy Central segment, complete with a fake Emory student (Justice Davenport) who opined: \"I had no idea I went to school with people who had different opinions from me. It\u2019s terrifying.\"\nNewspapers, network television and social media joined the beat-down, many asserting that counseling was being offered to soothe the bruised psyches of the offended students.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\n stated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that part of the story is off base, Emory spokeswoman Elaine Justice said.\n\"Emory University did not offer counseling to students as a result of the incident and subsequent controversy,\" Justice said in an email.\nPart of the counseling confusion comes from a March 22 email sent to students.\nThe email refers to \"emergency funds\" offered \"for student groups seeking to respond to the incident.\"\nBut those funds were not for counseling, Justice said. Snopes.com ruled as \"false\" one report that Emory provided \"emergency counseling.\"\n\"Likewise, the (Student Government Association) and College Council offered \u2018open office hours\u2019 to their fellow students, not counseling,\" Justice said.\nBut Justice also added this: \"As is the case at every university, counseling is routinely available to all students in whatever circumstances they are experiencing.\"\nDid any Emory student seek that routinely available counseling as a result of the chalkings? Justice said she did not know.\nOur ruling\nVarious media outlets reported that counseling was specifically offered to Emory students upset over the fact that someone chalked pro-Trump messages on campus.\nBut no funds were provided for any kind of emergency counseling due to the incident.\nCounseling is routinely provided to Emory students upon request. But there was no organized effort to counsel students due to this specific incident.\nThe university cannot confirm whether any individual students sought routine counseling as a result of the chalkings. And that does create a bit of uncertainty in the dust-up over the Trump chalkings and their aftermath.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05179"}
