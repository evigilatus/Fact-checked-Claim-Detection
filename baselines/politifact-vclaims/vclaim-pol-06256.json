In May of this year, the polling group found\u00a050 percent of Americans identify as pro-choice, compared to 44 percent of Americans who identify as pro-life.\nThat's actually up, not down.\nThe gap is outside the margin of error, the first time the pro-choice position has a statistically significant edge since 2008. If anything, the pro-choice position is gaining ground, not losing it in recent years. In 2012, 50 percent of people identified as pro-life, Gallup found, compared to 41 percent who identified as pro-choice.\nHere's a chart showing the Gallup results since 1996:\n\nBetween 1997 and 2008, people identifying as pro-choice hovered around 50 percent, and the pro-life group stayed in the mid 40s, according to Gallup. Between 2009 and 2014, the pro-life group occasionally surpassed the pro-choice group in the polls.\nAccording to the report, some shifts in public opinion on abortion have coincided with political events, such as related legislation or Supreme Court decisions. But because of an increasing percentage of Americans who say their views are primarily liberal, it\u2019s possible the pro-choice group will maintain its edge.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Those percentages have been near the same level for more than 20 years.\nThe divide has stayed \"remarkably stable\" as far back as 50 years, according to researchers out of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., who assembled data from several polls and published an article in The Atlantic about a year ago.\nThe article points out that in both 1975 and 2013, 54 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in certain circumstances.\nFor some additional context, the AEI research found that far fewer Americans consider abortion policy a high priority than you might expect, given the attention paid to the issue. In fact, only 1 percent of Americans polled by Gallup mentioned abortion as the most-important issue facing the country.\nThe authors also pointed out that Americans are conflicted on abortion -- noting a 2013 study that found many Americans identified as pro-life and pro-choice.\n\"Pro-life and pro-choice activists don't see the shades of gray that most Americans see on the issue,\" the authors wrote. \"Neither their actions nor court decisions have altered public opinion in any significant way since Roe was decided more than four decades ago.\"\nWe reached out to Trump through a spokesperson but did not hear back by our deadline.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"In terms of polling, the pro-choice (support) is going down a little bit.\"\nThere was a significant dip in the number of people who identified\u00a0as pro-choice in 2012, but that number has rebounded during the last three years, according to a Gallup survey. Other\u00a0research shows the percentage of\u00a0people who identify as pro-choice or\u00a0pro-life split has\u00a0stayed relatively stable for at least the past 20 years.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06256"}
