As prices approached and rose to $4 per gallon in late April, there was an old debate with one side that wanted to hold the winners accountable -- while the other side said that it was time to take advantage of America's protected oil fields. United States Sen. Rob Portman weighs in saying that price fixing, if there is any, should be tried, but it is also time to harness energy sources \"in our backyard.\" \"As an immediate bridge, we should increase access to oil exploration and production in energy-rich areas of the country, such as the outer continental shelf, and in parts of Alaska,\" said the Republic of Ohio in its column, which was working on the Senate website as well as on Red State.com. \"This will create jobs, boost investment, and immediately reduce our serious dependence on foreign oil.\" - Right away? Not so fast, experts say. Pretend that environmentalists dropped all objections to oil exploration on the outer continental shelf - that area at sea between states and the end of the United States ocean boundary. Also pretend that the public decided to need oil beyond what environmentalists see as the sanctity of the Arctic National Wildlife Shelter, or ANOR. And since we're just pretending, everybody joins: Drill, honey, dig. So wait. See you around 2021. These things take time. The process will have to start with tenders for government leases - usually a two- to three-year process - which could lead to the establishment of exploratory wells simply to know what lies below. It was only then that the time had come to develop production plans with the drilling of more wells, the construction of offshore platforms, the assembly and entry of pipelines and, finally, the bringing of oil to refineries. Phyllis Martin, a large energy analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Agency or the Environmental Energy Agency, told us, \"It's been a long time before you could go to production, and the lateness is important. As a general rule, \"it can be anywhere from three to 11 years, and actually three fast track, this is shallow production at sea,\" with little or no need for exploration or lease negotiations. The difference in prices was also misunderstood. This is because gasoline prices are fixed on the world market, and as various studies have indicated, OPEC and other foreign oil producers can lower oil prices or otherwise respond to keep prices high. \"So it won't have a big impact,\" said Martin. \"There will be a few pennies, but not large savings.\" In addition to talking to Martin, we considered several studies. Among the salient points: Jordan Rachel stated on January 16, 2021 in Tweedda that a minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of Taco Bell burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: January 20, 2021, the outer continental shelf of the Beaufort Alaskan Sea could produce its first oil in 2019, and the Chukchi Sea area in 2022, according to an analysis in February 2011 by the North's economy for exploration and production of the waterfall. Access to the continental outer shelf off the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico \"will not have a significant impact on the domestic production or prices of crude oil and natural gas before 2030,\" an update in 2009 of a previous study on environmental impact assessment. This was two years ago, when EIA said that \"hire will start no later than 2012 and production will not be expected before 2017.\" Push that back two years now. AnAR drilling takes 10 years to actually produce oil, according to the 2008 environmental impact assessment analysis requested by the late United States Sun. Ted Stevens, Alaska Republic. The analysis said that this 10-year timetable would be reversed if there were protracted legal battles or delays in obtaining government permits. Portman's claim appeared outside the base when we first saw him, but only because we saw something similar to him before. This was expressed by Mr. John McCain, a Republican in Arizona, in 2008 when he was running for President and gasoline prices rose. It has been repeated by a number of other GDP officials in recent weeks, each of whom wants to lift the federal ban on drilling faster and wider than President Barack Obama and the Democrats were willing to do. In 2008, Polyte Fructte ruled McCain's false claim, noting that while some economists and energy experts agreed that the production of more American oil would be useful for jobs and, ultimately, the trade balance, it would have no immediate impact on the supply or prices of gasoline. \"I have a problem linking drilling to current gas prices for political reasons,\" Dr. F. The Hajj, an assistant professor of economics at North Ohio University and an international expert in oil markets, informed Politi Fact about three years ago. \"The fact is that there is no relationship between today's prices and what gasoline will be discovered in the outer shelf.\" Before we studied this topic, we asked Christine Mange, speaking on behalf of Portman, about the source of her boss's allegation. In an e-mail, Mr. Portman referred, inter alia, to the situation in the Gulf. The Obama administration was not processing deep water permits in the Gulf, which contributed to a 13 per cent reduction in oil production there. By releasing our energy-rich domestic resources in a place like the Gulf, we can immediately reduce our dependence on foreign oil sources.\" However, Portman did not say anything about the Gulf of Mexico (which, according to the Environmental Impact Assessment, accounts for about 30 per cent of United States oil production). His column took a big look at energy needs and was not involved in the conflict over the Government &apos; s speed of licensing since the blood pressure spill in the Gulf in 2010. But most of the drilling operations in the Gulf are actually on the outer continental shelf, so we asked Andy Radford, Senior Policy Adviser at the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry business group. He said that at a high stage before the spill, the Gulf produced about 1.7 million barrels of oil per day. He said that that fell by 10 percent to 15 percent today. And if we have this oil now? There will be little impact on prices because oil trade is on the world market. India and developing countries consume more. Turmoel also plays a role in the Middle East. As for the landing in the Gulf of Mexico, \"Sudders can make up for it in a few hours,\" said Radford. \"The effect will be more psychological than anything else.\" In fairness, Portman spoke of reducing dependence on foreign oil, not of lowering the price. But he spoke of an \"immediate bridge\" to harness American natural resources through increased oil production and exploration \"in the energy-rich areas of our country such as the outer continental shelf, and in parts of Alaska.\" This would \"immediately reduce our serious dependence on foreign oil,\" he said. All the evidence is that she won't do it. The current decline in oil flowing from the Gulf, mentioned by Manji in defence of the President &apos; s claim, represents a small part of the country &apos; s oil production, and the decrease in the flow is not due entirely to the slow post-spill issuance of drilling permits. In some cases, the Gulf Fields were simply exploited, ending their productive lives, as stated by Richard Charter, Senior Policy Adviser for the Environmental Wildlife Group. In addition, new permits have been issued, according to records of the Office of Ocean Energy Management and its regulation and enforcement in the United States. New licences can lead to further exploration, but there is no guarantee that new exploration will lead to a specified quantity of oil. As we said before, it takes time. It should be noted that on the same day as the Portman column, the environmental impact assessment released its annual energy projections, saying that while United States consumption of liquid fuel is expected to continue to rise, the share of imports is declining and should continue to do so because of increases in production - including biofuels - and increased fuel efficiency. This does not mean that it would be useful or futile for the United States to produce more oil in the long term. Economists and others point to potential future economic, defence and trade benefits. However, Portman's claim is false by asserting that this would lead to an immediate reduction in dependence on foreign oil.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13157"}
