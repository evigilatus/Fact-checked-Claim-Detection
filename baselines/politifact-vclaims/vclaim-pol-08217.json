Kristol argued that the United States has a responsibility to help out nations like Ukraine more than they have in the past.\n\"Ten years ago there was the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, it was the first color revolution in spite of other efforts around the world. \u2026 All honor to the people of the Ukraine,\" Kristol said. \"That first revolution unfortunately slipped away. I think that\u2019s partly our fault, the west Europeans\u2019 fault. We didn\u2019t do as much as we could have to help the newly democratic Ukraine.\"\nWhether or not the United States helped Ukraine enough a decade ago is a matter of opinion. But we can check Kristol\u2019s assertion about the Orange Revolution and its place in history.\nKristol didn\u2019t return our request for comment.\nWhat is a color revolution?\nEastern European uprisings have taken on many names. Czechoslovakia nonviolently overthrew its Communist government in 1989 in what was known as the Velvet Revolution.\nBut the \"color revolutions\" speak to a more specific group of revolutions that came well after the original fall of Soviet Union, experts told us. They're associated with colors in a broad sense.\n\"Color revolutions came to denote pro-western government coming to power in former Soviet republics,\" said Anton Fedyashin, a Soviet history professor at American University. \"None of them have succeeded in the long run.\"\nExperts generally identify three color revolutions:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRose Revolution, Georgia, 2003\n\n\nOrange Revolution, Ukraine, 2004\n\n\nTulip Revolution, Kyrgyzstan, 2005\n\n\nThe first color revolution took place in Georgia in November 2003, when Georgian protesters overthrew the government of Eduard Shevardnadze and elected 35-year-old U.S. educated Mikheil Saakashvili. (The name, Rose Revolution, comes from the flower, but it is considered a \"color\" revolution.)\nUkraine\u2019s Orange Revolution came a year later and ended when opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko was elected president. (Yuschenko defeated Yanukovych, Ukraine\u2019s now-deposed leader.) The revolution was originally branded \"orange\" because that was Yuschenko\u2019s signature campaign color.\nSo Kristol was wrong when he said Ukraine\u2019s revolution was first. But Donnacha Beach\u00e1in, a Dublin City University government professor who published a book on the color revolutions, did say Ukraine\u2019s revolution attracted much more attention than Georgia\u2019s due to the nation\u2019s larger population.\nOur ruling\nKristol said the Ukraine Orange Revolution \"was the first color revolution.\" It was the biggest color revolution, but experts say nobody considers it the first. Georgia\u2019s Rose Revolution took place a year earlier.\nWe rate\u00a0Kristol\u2019s claim False.\nThis item was updated at 6:51 p.m., Feb. 23, 2014, to note that the \"color\" revolutions speak more to a group of revolutions that have loose ties to colors -- than actual revolutions with colors in their names.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08217"}
