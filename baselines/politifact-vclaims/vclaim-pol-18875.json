Anybody know these things? \u2026 We don\u2019t teach them. We\u2019ve got to give people facts.\"\nThomas Edison, of course, is widely acknowledged as the inventor of the lightbulb \u2014 among many other things.\nIs Biden right that someone else should get the credit?\nThe origin of the incandescent lightbulb\nThe road to the modern incandescent bulb was a meandering one, with many inventors contributing over a period of decades.\nElectric power was developed in the early 19th Century, and inventors immediately set about applying this development to lighting. Many early attempts focused on arc lighting, in which a bright light is created by electricity sparking between two points, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.\nWhen arc lighting was too bright and required too much power, prompting a pivot to an incandescent solution.\u00a0\nAmong the key early developments, according to Britannica and other sources:\n\n\n1801 \u2014 English chemist Sir Humphry Davy demonstrated strips heated by electricity would glow, but his filaments didn\u2019t last long.\n\n\n1841 \u2014 Frederick de Moleyns of England received the first patent for an incandescent lamp, using powdered charcoal between two platinum wires.\n\n\n1865 \u2014 The mercury pump is developed, allowing the glowing filament to be placed in a vacuum, which made it glow longer.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1878 \u2014 English physicist Sir Joseph Wilson Swan developed a carbon-filament bulb.\n\n\n1879 \u2014 Thomas Edison developed his carbon-filament bulb, enclosed in a superior vacuum to extend the life of the filament.\n\n\nSwan and Edison both applied for patents in 1880, prompting litigation that dragged on until the two formed a joint company in 1883.\n\"Edison has always received the major credit for inventing the lightbulb, because of his development of the power lines and other equipment needed to establish the incandescent lamp in a practical lighting system,\" the Britannica entry said.\nA profile of Edison in Time Magazine in 1979 summarized Edison\u2019s role this way: \"Above all, Edison invented the first practical electric light, and a power-distribution system that put it cheaply into every home.\"\nWe should note, all of the inventors referenced here were white.\nSo who is Biden referring to?\nThe role of Lewis Latimer\nA spokesman said Biden was referencing Lewis Latimer, a prolific inventor who worked with both Edison and Alexander Graham Bell (credited with inventing the telephone).\nLatimer did indeed play a key role in the spread of electric lighting. He was a member of the elite \"Edison\u2019s Pioneers\" research team and wrote the first book in the United States on electric lighting in 1890, according to a biography on the MIT website. Latimer also oversaw electric lighting installation in the streets and buildings of New York, Philadelphia, London and other cities, according to a 1988 New York Times story.\nMost notably for the question at hand, Latimer developed a filament that lasted longer than those developed by Edison and others, making the widespread use of electric lighting more feasible. He received a patent in September 1881 for \"new and useful improvements in incandescent electric lamps.\"\nThat was a year and a half after Edison received an electric lamp patent in January 1880.\nBiden\u2019s general point in referencing Latimer and Black Wall Street \u2014 a Tulsa, OK. neighborhood where up to 300 people are believed to have died in race riots in 1921 \u2014 is a lack of education on Black history in America.\nBut his specific claim in making that point overreaches.\nOur ruling\nSpeaking in Kenosha, Biden said, \"A Black man invented the light bulb, not a white guy named Edison.\"\nThe Black man referenced here, Latimer, did indeed play an important role in the development and adaptation of the incandescent light bulb. So did many other inventors in the decades preceding Edison\u2019s patent.\u00a0\nEdison certainly wasn\u2019t the sole inventor. He built on the work of others.\nWhile Biden may have a point about the need to better teach Black history, he greatly exaggerates in his example by minimizing Edison to credit only Latimer. All the evidence we\u2019ve reviewed shows Latimer played a lesser role than Edison, and later in the process.\nWe define Mostly False as a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18875"}
