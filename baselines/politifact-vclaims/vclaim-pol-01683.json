They\u2019re going to try to label me, someone who\u2019s been a small-town supervisor, who has kept a balanced budget, who has increased surpluses, who has led us to the highest credit rating our town has ever had, who is an Eagle Scout, who is a father and a husband and a dad, that I\u2019m some type of radical because I have a D next to my name. When is this game of party affiliation going to end?\"\nWe decided to evaluate the claims he made about his tenure as Grand Island supervisor. He began a four-year term in January 2016. \u00a0\nBalanced budget\nLocal governments must adopt balanced budgets, according to the New York State Comptroller\u2019s Office.\u00a0Excluding capital projects which are funded by debt not included in balanced budget calculations, the town took in $19.9 million in 2016 and spent $18.6 million, according to the town\u2019s financial statements.\u00a0\nIn 2017, the town posted revenues of $20 million and spent $19.1 million. \u00a0\nDeducting spending on capital projects from the town's financial statements is the most accurate way to evaluate McMurray's balanced budget claim,\u00a0said Pam Barton, Grand Island\u2019s accountant.\nSurpluses\nIs that the same as a surplus?\nThe generally accepted definition of \"surplus\" in town government is the amount of money in \"unassigned fund balance\" in the town\u2019s general fund, Barton said.\nFor Grand Island, the unassigned fund balance was $5.9 million in 2015,\u00a0the year before McMurray took office,\u00a0$6.8 million in 2016\u00a0and $6.7 million in 2017.\u00a0It dropped a bit last year but was still higher than the surplus from the year before he took office.\nCredit ratings\nGrand Island received its highest credit rating since at least 2001 in September 2016, Barton said.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

Barton said because of the town\u2019s size and budget, it likely will never reach the highest rating.\nBarton said the town has always been rated by Moody\u2019s, and has not received ratings from Standard & Poor\u2019s or Fitch Ratings.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nMcMurray made three claims about his record of managing Grand Island\u2019s finances.\nIt\u2019s fair to point out that Grand Island\u2019s strong financial position is the result of years of sound management, not only changes made since McMurray took office in 2016, Barton said.\n\"He\u2019s been continuing the things that have been in place from before,\" the town accountant said.\nStill, his claim about keeping a balanced budget is true.\nMcMurray\u2019s claim about increasing surpluses is mostly true. The town had more surplus funds at the end of 2017 than it did when he took office, though it decreased slightly in his second year in office.\nHis claim that the town has the highest credit rating it has ever had is true, based on all available information.\nWe rate his statement True.\n Share the Facts 2018-09-06 14:45:22 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  Says he\u2019s a \"small-town supervisor who has kept a balanced budget, who has increased surpluses, who has led us to the highest credit rating our town has ever had.\"    Nathan McMurray Democratic congressional candidate, NY-27 votemcmurray.com/2018/08/17/watch-collins-challenger-nate-mcmurray-speaks-on-congressmans-arrest/   in a news conference at the UAW 897 hall in Hamburg Wednesday, August 8, 2018 2018-08-08    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01683"}
