The mail shows a split picture of Alison on the left, and on the right is a picture of a woman with a swollen cheek and an eye for bruises. The text above and below states: \"Keith Ellison, a candidate for the position of Attorney General of Minnesota and Vice-Chairman of the National Democratic Committee, did so to his friend. But Democrats don't want to talk about this.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The information in the mail is old. Ellison won the Minnesota Public Prosecutor &apos; s Race in November 2018, and then stepped down Vice President DNC. But was the woman in the picture a friend of Alison's? Is he responsible for the injuries? The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman \u2022 January 11, 2012, no, no. The picture is erroneous and has appeared on the Internet on various websites for several years. After looking at a reverse image, we found the image of the injured woman, which has been shared on the Internet since 2013 at least on Russian websites, with a few descriptions or details. The photograph began with the name Ellison around the time his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monhan, accused him of assaulting him in 2018. In August of that year, Monahan's son wrote a long article in Facebook alleging that Alison had assaulted his mother. Monahan confirmed her son's account. In a statement, Ellison admitted two were in a relationship that ended in 2016, but denied abuse or the existence of such a video. In this context, this image of a woman's bruises began to spread over the Internet, and people claim it was Monhan. But Monahan herself said it wasn't her, and asked the users not to share it \"with me or my story. Please honor these women with wounds, pain and trauma.\" This picture isn't me. Please don't share any contact with me or my story. Please honor these ladies' wounds, pain and trauma. Thank you. https://t.co/JQn95QwyW-Karin Munahan (@KarenMonahan01) 22 September 2018 Munahan issued medical notes from her doctor who said that she was in a physical and emotional relationship, and that she identified the partner as Ellison. But the doctor also noticed that she didn't have any physical injuries that required physical examination.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00116"}
