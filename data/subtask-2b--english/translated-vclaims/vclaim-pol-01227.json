Manchen wrote a newspaper article with Sen. Lisa Morkovsky, R-Alaska, published in the news of Parkersburg and Sentinel on 14 October 2018. Several bi-party efforts by Manchin and Morkovsky on the national energy policy are heard. In a section detailing a joint amendment to the National Defence Licensing Act introduced by senators this year, Manchin and Morkovsky wrote that \"we import at least 50 per cent of 50 mineral commodities each year, including 100 per cent of 21.\" Is that right? We were able to trace Manchen &apos; s claim to a report published by the United States Geological Survey in January 2018. The report contains figures showing the extent to which the United States relies on imports of individual commodities and where they come from. This report, published annually, indicates that in 2017, \"imports accounted for more than half of the apparent consumption by the United States of 50 non-fuel mineral commodities, and the United States relied on imports of 100 per cent for 21 such commodities.\" This is a chart of the report summarizing critical metals, the percentage of imports and countries of origin. In an interview with Fox News on January 17, 2021, President Donald Trump says, \"He can't say anything (about the riots that took place in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms removed it.\" Some of the goods imported by the United States are arsenic, asbestos and gems. The report stated that China and Canada were the largest suppliers of mineral goods to the United States in 2017. We only found one thing to manipulate about the statement. Manchin and Morkovsky would have been more precise if they had put the phrase \"at least\" in a different place, by writing that the United States imports \"at least 50 per cent of 50 mineral commodities each year, including 100 per cent of 21.\" In his joint press article with Morkovsky, Manchen wrote that the United States imports \"at least 50 per cent of 50 mineral commodities each year, including 100 per cent of 21 of them.\" The idea is well thought out, although the language is slightly confused. It's actually \"at least 50% of 50 mineral commodities.\" We're mostly evaluating the statement right.
