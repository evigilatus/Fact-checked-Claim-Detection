Senate Democrats generally favor an extension, while Republicans insist that any extension be offset by spending cuts elsewhere. The temporary extended benefits, meanwhile, expired Dec. 28, 2013.\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, a D.C.-based group dedicated to maintaining Democratic control of the upper chamber, waded into the issue. In a Jan. 15, 2014, news release, Justin Barasky, the group\u2019s national press secretary, blamed the lack of extension, in part, on two Oregon Republican senatorial candidates -- Portland physician Monica Wehby and state Rep. Jason Conger, R-Bend.\nBoth hope to oppose the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Jeff Merkley, in the November general election.\n\"Monica Wehby and Jason Conger\u2019s reckless refusal to support the renewal of unemployment benefits is causing devastating consequences for nearly 23,000 Oregonians looking for work and hurting the state\u2019s economy more each day,\" Barasky wrote.\nAre Wehby and Conger \"causing devastating consequences\" for unemployed Oregonians? PolitiFact Oregon wondered how that could be, since neither candidate is even in the Senate.\nWe contacted the Wehby and Conger campaigns.\nConger, now in his second term in the Oregon House, confirmed on KXL\u2019s \"The Lars Larson Show\" on Jan. 8, 2014, that he would not vote to extend unemployment benefits if he were in Congress.\nHe told PolitiFact Oregon: \"I don\u2019t think another extension of benefits will actually help people who have been long-term unemployed and already extended multiple times.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWehby, in a statement, said she supports a temporary extension of benefits, but added, \"We need to find a way to pay for these extensions by cutting government waste.\"\nHowever, representatives of both campaigns noted that neither candidate is in the U.S. Senate, so neither has any direct say on the issue.\nWe contacted Barasky, who defended his assertions in an email.\nRegarding the candidates\u2019 positions on benefits extensions, he referred to the original news release. It underscored Conger\u2019s statements to Larson, which Conger confirmed. It also cited a Jan. 14, 2014, news story that ran on mycolumbiabasin.com that said that Wehby, following a swing through the state to meet with business owners, indicated \"she\u2019s not so sure it\u2019s the right way to go.\"\nBarasky said another quote in the story demonstrates Wehby\u2019s opposition to an extension. The story said U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., disputes the idea that long-term benefits dissuade workers from returning to work. It then added, \"Wehby thinks Wyden is wrong.\"\n\"How is that anything but opposition?\" he wrote us. In our reading, however, Wehby was disputing Wyden\u2019s take only on the effect of unemployment extensions.\nThe question of an unemployment benefits extension did not come up at a debate last Saturday among GOP candidates, including Conger and Wehby, hoping to take on Merkley. If it had, Conger said he would have said no, but told us he commiserates with those looking for work. Wehby said she would have answered yes -- with the qualifier that any extension be paid for through spending offsets elsewhere. That pokes a hole in Barasky\u2019s assertion that both candidates oppose an extension.\nOn the larger question of whether the candidates are \"causing devastating consequences\" to unemployed Oregonians, Barasky said, \"We know they aren\u2019t in the Senate, and our release doesn\u2019t pretend they are. We are saying, if they were in the Senate, this is how they\u2019d be voting and those votes would be hurting unemployed Oregonians.\"\nBut that\u2019s not what his statement says. It accuses Conger and Wehby, through \"reckless refusal,\" of \"causing devastating consequences\" -- present tense -- for Oregon\u2019s unemployed workers.\nThat\u2019s just wrong; neither is in a position to cast a vote on the issue, let alone cause \"devastating consequences\" for Oregonians. Even if one is elected to the Senate, he or she won\u2019t be sworn in for nearly a year. Barasky, given the chance to revise the claim, doubled down, saying he was on \"solid ground.\" We rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08338"}
