Asked by a reporter about the project, Morgan confirmed that all 78 miles of what he described as \"new\" border wall built so far are replacements for existing barriers. The work includes building steel bollard fencing, which consists of vertical steel posts with a small amount of space between them.\u00a0\nIt is not, however, the solid concrete wall that Trump promised during his campaign\u00a0and said Mexico would pay for.\n\"The Trump Administration has not completed any new miles of border wall. Replacement wall is not new wall,\" Pelosi\u2019s spokesman Drew Hammill told us in an email.\u00a0\nHammill added that the House Appropriations Committee hasn\u2019t funded any new border wall, at least not of the type Trump had promised.\u00a0\nThat is supported by The Washington Post\u2019s September analysis of the project\u2019s funding. \"Trump asked Congress in 2018 for $25 billion to cover the cost, but Congress refused. Lawmakers appropriated $1.57 billion, restricted to \"fencing,\" such as \"currently deployed steel bollard designs,\" the Post reported.\u00a0\nAs PolitiFact National reported back in January, \"Congress has not appropriated money for a wall. Fencing is being built or has been completed at the southwest border. But not a wall.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump reviews border wall prototypes, Tuesday, March 13, 2018, in San Diego.

So far, it includes two twin see-through panels of 18-foot-tall steel beams, according to the\u00a0Times.\nA matter of semantics\nTheresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said much of the debate over Trump\u2019s progress and whether he\u2019s built any \"new wall\" comes down to semantics.\u00a0\n\"It depends on your definition of 'new,' Cardinal Brown wrote in an email. \"If 'new' is defined as newly-built, even if it is replacing other barriers in the same location, then you can accurately say new wall has been built. If 'new' is defined as built in new locations along the border where previous barriers did not exist, then it would be correct to say that there hasn\u2019t been any new wall built. It is that semantic difference that the government and Democrats are exploiting in their rhetoric.\"\u00a0\n\nOur rating\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently claimed President Trump \"hasn\u2019t built any new wall\" during his time in office.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s supported, in part, by the Trump administration\u2019s Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner. He confirmed at a press briefing last week that all 78 miles of what he described as \"new\" border wall built so far are replacements for existing barriers.\u00a0\nThese replacement barriers, however, aren\u2019t the solid, concrete wall candidate Trump talked about. They are see-through bollard fencing.\u00a0\nPelosi\u2019s statement does leave out one piece of key information. Construction is now underway on the first original stretch of border barriers during Trump\u2019s presidency, an eight-mile section of fencing in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\u00a0\nPelosi\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nWe rate it Mostly True.\u00a0\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16825"}
