He told us by email that he was referring to a June 5, 2013, verdict that got national news coverage, in which a San Antonio jury acquitted a man of murder in the death of an escort he hired from an online advertisement.\nSan Antonio Express-News and KSAT-TV news reports on the trial said defendant Ezekiel Gilbert testified that he had found Lenora Ivie Frago\u2019s ad on Craigslist and believed sex was included in her $150 fee.\nInstead, she left after about 20 minutes, saying she had to give the money to her driver, Gilbert testified. The driver pulled away and Gilbert shot at the car with an assault rifle. Frago was hit and paralyzed, dying six months later when her family took her off artificial respiration.\nGilbert's defense team argued that his actions were justified because he was trying to retrieve stolen property. They said that Frago misled Gilbert when they arranged the transaction, making her refusal to have sex or return his money into theft.\nReich disagreed. \"Failure to perform a service that is illegal -- kidnapping a baby, bribing a legislator, delivering cocaine, or providing sex for money -- is not a theft,\" he said.\n\"Anyone exercising common sense would understand that this was at most a contractual dispute over what he paid for and what she owed him in return,\" he said, later adding, \"It must be that the jury regarded prostitution as a crime, warranting the use of deadly force. But since prostitution is not a crime warranting the use of deadly force -- it is typically prosecuted under nuisance laws,\" the verdict means \"it is permissible in Texas to shoot someone who commits a public nuisance.\"\nIn his initial emails to us, Reich said this was the only way to interpret the verdict. He later switched to saying it is \"one way\" to view the decision.\nLegal experts and Gilbert\u2019s defense lawyer disagreed with him.\nBobby Barrera, a defense lawyer for Gilbert, said Reich \"is flat wrong and not even arguably close to accurate on the interpretation of the law.\"\nThe law in question is state Penal Code Title 2, Chapter 9, Section 42, which says using deadly force to protect one\u2019s property is justified in limited circumstances, including when the person \"reasonably believes\" such force is necessary to prevent imminent \"theft during the nighttime\" or \"criminal mischief during the nighttime.\"\nJurors concluded that the \"theft\" justification applied in this case, Barrera told us by phone, because testimony indicated Frago and her driver had a history of taking money from clients who believed they would receive sex in return.\n\"She was committing a scam,\" he said.\nEven then, Barrera said, the jury had to find other conditions were met, such as requirements that Gilbert reasonably believed he couldn\u2019t get his money back any other way or without risking injury to himself.\n\"It is not open season on prostitutes\" or thieves in Texas, Barrera said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This has gone, as you know, viral with \u2018It\u2019s legal to shoot prostitutes in Texas,\u2019 \u2018Stupid Texans and their guns,\u2019 \" he said. \"Nobody wanted to know the truth; they just wanted to conclude what they wanted.\"\nAs to shooting someone for committing a public nuisance, Barrera said, \"You cannot under any circumstances do so.\"\nUniversity of Texas law professor George Dix, who specializes in criminal law, told us by email, \"Reich, in my view, is simply wrong.\"\nFrago and Gilbert\u2019s transaction would be theft, Dix said, if Frago did not intend to provide sex at the time she made the agreement with Gilbert. \"What would make this criminal and not merely a civil contract dispute is the misrepresentation by which Frago obtained the money,\" he said.\n\"In fact, anyone with a basic knowledge of theft law would understand that this could have been theft rather than \u2018just\u2019 a contractual dispute,\" Dix said. \"It could be theft under Section 31.02 of the Penal Code if the deceased promised to provide sex for the payment and at that time did not intend to provide that sex if she was paid.\"\nEven so, he said, \"The jury might not have been convinced this actually was theft, but also convinced the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not theft.\"\nThat\u2019s two legal eagles saying that, contrary to Reich\u2019s assertion, the jury didn\u2019t have to consider prostitution as a reason for justifying deadly force.\nEven if prostitution had been a crucial point, it\u2019s not a \"public nuisance\" in Texas law. It\u2019s classified under \"public indecency\" in Penal Code Title 9, Section 43.02.\nPublic nuisances can be much lesser offenses such as creating noise, Texas District and County Attorneys Association spokesman Clay Abbott told us by phone.\nReich\u2019s example of the highway spraypainter bridges the gap: \"Spraypainting would be both a public nuisance and criminal mischief,\" Abbott said.\nEven if the offense were serious, he said, a jury would have to decide that other conditions were met. To justify deadly force in protecting a third person\u2019s property -- namely, the overpass -- the damage being halted must be so extreme it could never be repaired; the shooter must have no other way to stop the spraypainter without risking injury and must have reasonably believed deadly force was the only way to stop the spraypainter.\nSpraypaint can be removed or painted over, so the example falls down right there, Abbott said. \"It\u2019s a ridiculous statement.\"\nDix said, \"I stress this is not an example of a rule that in Texas one can \u2018shoot someone who\u2019s committing a \"public nuisance\" under the cover of dark.\u2019 It is an example of a Texas rule providing broadly (and probably unwisely) that one can use even deadly force to protect property from loss or damage.\"\nLike Dix and Barrera, Abbott told us Reich is wrong to say Texans can use deadly force on someone committing a public nuisance. They also emphasized that the existence of a possible legal defense does not mean the shooter would be acquitted or that shooting criminals is the right thing to do.\nOne final point: We wondered why the law specified \"during the nighttime.\" Abbott speculated it was a holdover from English common law. Many states once had definitions of burglary with a stipulation about nighttime, which William Blackstone\u2019s 18th-century analysis of English law said makes the crime more serious not so much because daylight is lacking but because \"sleep has disarmed the owner, and rendered his castle defenceless.\"\nOur ruling\nReich said that in Texas, \"it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a \u2018public nuisance\u2019 under the cover of dark,\" claiming that a recent acquittal hinged on prostitution, that prostitution was a form of public nuisance, and that therefore it\u2019s legal to shoot people creating a nuisance.\nLegal experts and a lawyer in the murder trial told us Reich was wrong. The verdict hinged on theft; prostitution is not a \"public nuisance\" in Texas; and state law doesn\u2019t say deadly force can be used on people creating nuisances. Notably, too, the law includes many other restrictions on deadly force, not just what type of crime is being committed.\nWe rate the statement as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09096"}
