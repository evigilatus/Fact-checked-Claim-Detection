A claim shot full of holes", "text": "Facing questions from reporters on Oct. 2 about whether the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history would stir action on gun control, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called up a page straight from the campaign playbook of her boss.\n\"I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn\u2019t helped there,\" Sanders said. \"So, I think we have to, when that time comes for those conversations to take place, then I think we have to look at things that may actually have a real impact.\"\nSanders\u2019 statement was nearly identical to that of her boss nearly a year ago.\nDuring his third debate with Hillary Clinton in October 2016, Donald Trump used Chicago to bolster his belief in the folly of fighting gun crime with stricter gun laws.\n\"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump was correct that Chicago\u2019s gun violence led the nation. But a check by PolitiFact Illinois revealed that he was wrong by a long shot about the city having \"the toughest gun laws in the United States.\"\nJust about anyone who follows crime trends and gun regulations in the U.S. with any degree of seriousness knows by now that the \"Chicago-as-gun-law-Mecca\" charge is a canard that lost its last vestige of credibility more than four years ago, when Illinois became the last state in the nation to allow concealed carry of firearms.\nTrump, following the rhetoric lead of many other strong gun rights advocates, has over the years frequently pointed to Chicago as \"proof\" that gun ownership restrictions not only fail to reduce crime, but exacerbate it.\nThe most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2014\n\nSanders took Trump\u2019s illogical and invalid argument a step further. Now Chicago\u2019s handgun ownership history proves that mass shootings committed with automatic weapons can\u2019t be prevented with legal restrictions.\nHere\u2019s why Sanders and all of those who continue to repeat her statement on social media and elsewhere are wrong about Chicago\u2019s gun laws.\nBan banished\nChicago\u2019s reputation for strict gun laws is rooted in its 1982 ban on handguns. When the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s District of Columbia vs. Heller \u00a0decision in 2008 struck down a similar ban in the District of Columbia, Chicago was the only major city left with a blanket handgun prohibition. The distinction didn\u2019t last long.\nIn 2010, the high court followed up Heller with a ruling in McDonald vs. City of Chicago which nullified Chicago\u2019s ban. At that, the concealed carry of firearms was still outlawed in Chicago as it was throughout all of Illinois.\nTwo years later, however, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Illinois concealed carry ban as unconstitutional and the state soon after became the last in the nation to approve concealed carry.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\n\n\nstated on June 8, 2016 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Mark\u00a0Kirk \"called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans\" and\u00a0\"was apparently fine with Trump\u2019s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Kevin Hoffman \u2022 July 15, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we noted last year in fact-checking Trump\u2019s Chicago-bashing:\nWith that, Chicago lost its status -- or its stigma, depending on your perspective -- of having the strictest gun possession laws in the United States. In comparably sized big cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city administers the concealed-carry permitting process. In Illinois, the Illinois State Police processes applications, so it can be argued that Chicago has less autonomy in restricting concealed carry within its borders than do other cities.\nWe also noted last year that the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for stricter gun laws, found Illinois\u2019 firearm laws too lenient in several ways, all of which still apply:\nIllinois\u2019 gun laws still are considered among the most restrictive when compared with other states. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun control, gives Illinois a B+ and ranks it No. 8 in the nation on its \"Smart Gun Laws\" report card. The group lauds Illinois for, among several rules, requiring firearm owners to obtain a Firearm Owners\u2019 ID card that includes a background check and imposes a waiting period on firearm purchases.\nBut it also knocks Illinois for not requiring registration of firearms, for its lack of restriction on the purchase of multiple firearms and for not allowing local jurisdictions to regulate firearms. In other words, Illinois could make its gun laws much more strict than they are.\nSeven states receive higher grades than Illinois in the latest Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ratings.\nUpdate\nIn last year\u2019s fact-check, we noted that Trump\u2019s statement also could have been interpreted as Chicago having strict gun laws because it imposed strict penalties on those who violate them or use guns in crimes. Even staunch gun rights advocates have argued that this approach can be an effective crime deterrent where restrictions on lawful gun ownership are both unconstitutional and ineffective.\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel had for several years pushed unsuccessfully for a new state law containing harsher penalties for repeat gun offenders. A 2014 report by the Chicago Sun-Times found that lenient sentencing for gun offenders was a factor in repeat offenses. That was where things stood when Trump made his statement in 2016.\nThat changed on June 23, when Gov. Bruce Rauner signed into law a bill that, among other things, increased the minimum sentence for repeat gun offenders from three to seven years. Thus even the argument that Chicago favors getting tough on lawful gun owners over cracking down on gun criminals no longer applies.\nOur ruling\nSanders, fielding questions about the impact of the Las Vegas massacre, pointed to chronic \u00a0gun violence in Chicago as proof that tough gun laws were ineffective. \"I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country,\" she said. \"That certainly hasn\u2019t helped there,\"\nThere was a brief time between 2008 and 2010 -- the window during which Washington, D.C.\u2019s handgun ban had been invalidated but Chicago\u2019s still stood -- where that might have been true. But federal court rulings effectively undid city and state laws severely restricting gun use and ownership in the Chicago. When it comes to the concealed carry of weapons, Chicago has less authority to impose limitations than do many other large U.S. cities.\nIn the thick of 2016 presidential campaign, we rated a nearly identical statement from then candidate Trump as Mostly False. Since then, similar claims have been uttered frequently by others and repeatedly debunked.\nSanders therefore has had ample opportunity to learn her boss had been flat wrong when making the same claim on the campaign trail. Her revival of the claim, made in the midst of the debate raging over the Las Vegas massacre, is at best intellectually lazy and at worst a deliberate attempt to mislead.\nThere\u2019s no mitigating factor or missing context here. Sanders\u2019 statement earns our lowest credibility rating, Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-03 20:35:50 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country.
