According to the article, the police warn people not to use windshield scanners if they lay eggs on their car. Why? The article says it's fraudulent to underestimate their vision of the road and put them at risk. The full mail claims: \"MSG OFCIAL from the police: If you drive the car at night and lay eggs on your windshield, don't stop to check the car, don't turn on the mop and don't spray any water, because eggs mixed with water become milk and block your vision to 92.5%, and then you have to stop by the side of the road and become the victim of these criminals. This is a new technology used by gangs, so please inform your friends and relatives. More importantly, they are not selfish and refuse to share this message.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, that's not a widespread problem that the \"police\" warned people about; it's one of those wholesale tricks that refuses to go away. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 January 16, 2012, this warning began as a series of e-mails in 2009. Various versions have sometimes identified a site where these carjackings or carjackings are supposed to occur, mostly in places outside the United States such as Lebanon, Malaysia, India or other parts of Asia. Despite the longevity of these rumours, we searched the Nixus news archives and were unable to find any reports from law enforcement agencies or the media of such incidents in the United States. However, we encountered a similar isolated incident on June 23, 2019 (three days after this article was published on Facebook) in eastern Delhi, India. According to news reports, the journalist Mitali Chandola was shot in the hand while sitting in her car at the light that stopped after the eggs were thrown at her windshield. However, the real world incident differs from the steps detailed in this ongoing viral warning, as Chandola was not harmed after stopping to wipe the eggs. According to the news reports, the shooting occurred immediately after the egging. Nor can we find any evidence that \"watered eggs become milk and block your vision to 92.5%.\" After the e-mail series began to deploy, the Daily newspaper Decatur (Ala) decided to test the claim in 2009. After smashing eggs on the driver's side of the windshield, a thick, clean film covered the glass. The splashing of glass immediately with fluids and the operation of the spaces removed most of the remains. Despite chaos, eggs will not force a driver to withdraw immediately by the side of the road because of low visibility.\" We even found a YouTube player who tested the prosecution on video using his scanners and his windshield spray in an attempt to clean up the multiple broken egg mess during the day and night, and we found, as a martyr, \"That's not a problem, it's not a problem.\" We're assessing this false warning.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00493"}
