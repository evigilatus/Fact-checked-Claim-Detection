Not only had Friedrich, now too old to be drafted, not done his military service, but he had become a U.S. citizen, Blair explained to PolitiFact.\nWhy the history lesson?\nWell, on April 2, 2019, (which happens to be International Fact-Checking Day), in making remarks to reporters about Germany, referred to his father, Fred, and said:\n\"My father is German, right? Was German, and born in a very wonderful place in Germany.\"\nA flurry of news reports quickly declared that the president had uttered a falsehood about his father\u2019s birthplace \u00a0\u2014 again. The stories pointed out that, as has been reported many times, Fred Trump was born in New York. Just as his New York Times obituary says he was.\n(Interestingly, as the New York Times obit notes, Fred Trump at one stage of his life took to telling people he was of Swedish origin. Blair told us that was likely due to his business dealings with many Jewish people in New York and to anti-German sentiment in the United States during and after World War II.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

OK. But, born in Germany, no.\"\nNewsweek and The Independent reported that Trump has made the erroneous claim about his father at least four times since taking office.\nEach time, according to Newsweek, he has been either criticizing Germany's contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the European Union's trade relationship with the U.S.\nOur ruling\nDonald Trump said his father was born in Germany \u00a0\u2014 even though, as has been reported many times -- Fred Trump was born in New York.\nIt\u2019s unclear why the president keeps repeating it, but it\u2019s wrong.\nPants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-04 20:59:39 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says his father, Fred Trump, was \"born in a very wonderful place in Germany.\"    Donald Trump President https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly5hNFgJvUQ   In remarks to reporters Tuesday, April 2, 2019 2019-04-02    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00801"}
