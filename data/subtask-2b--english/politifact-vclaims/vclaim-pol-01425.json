They say Republicans should at the very least expand Medicaid, which experts have said could help cover up to 500,000 people in the state.\nRepublicans\u2019 main defense is that expanding Medicaid is too expensive and that Democrats want to go several steps further than that. An ad campaign by the state Republican Party says Democrats have a \"radical\" health care agenda that will \"destroy our economy, kill our jobs, take more of your hard-earned dollars in taxes, and infringe on your personal freedoms.\"\nThe NC GOP attack on Democrats, which includes digital ads and mailers in districts across the state, is summarized on\u00a0RadicalDemAgenda.com. The party has purchased internet domain names of Democratic candidates \u2014 such as JulieVonHaefen.com \u2014 to reach voters. Republican candidates are using the same messaging in ads they pay for.\nThe GOP claim is two-pronged.\nFirst, that \"55 liberal members and candidates of the North Carolina Democratic House Caucus signed a pledge to enact an extreme, far-left healthcare agenda.\"\nSecond, that \"part of their health care agenda is to force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme. The non-partisan North Carolina General Assembly Fiscal Research staff calculated it would cost North Carolina $72 billion and force all residents to give up their current health care plan.\"\nDid Democrats \"pledge\" to \"force\" North Carolinians into a single-payer health system that would cost $72 billion?\nLet\u2019s break it down.\nSingle-payer health care\nThe term \"single-payer\" refers to a health insurance system in which the federal government, rather than private insurers, pays all medical expenses.\nThe NC GOP\u2019s claim about a single-payer plan refers to a bill,\u00a0HB 916, introduced last year that would have studied the cost of creating a single-payer health system. Bill sponsors included House Democrats Cecil Brockman, Verla Insko, Larry Bell, Jean Farmer-Butterfield, Susan Fisher, Charles Graham, Pricey Harrison, Yvonne Holley, Garland Pierce and Bobbie Richardson.\nIt was ignored until this June, when Republican leaders moved it into a committee. Rep. David Lewis, a Republican from Harnett County, then asked the nonpartisan fiscal research staff to calculate the cost of a single-payer health care system in North Carolina.\nThat\u2019s when Insko moved to kill it, saying any analysis of the bill should\u2019ve been completed by the end of last year. It\u2019s also when Richardson took her name off the bill because she didn\u2019t want to be a part of the GOP\u2019s \"political game,\" according to her campaign manager, Taylor Grady-Daly.\nThe cost of a single-payer plan would likely exceed $72 billion per year, according to legislative staff. About $30.1 billion could be paid for with federal dollars, but North Carolina would be responsible for $41.89 billion \u2014 nearly double the current general fund budget,\u00a0The N&O reported.\nThe two-page bill merely directs the legislature to study a single-payer system that its sponsors would like to implement, but the bill doesn\u2019t implement that system on its own. PolitiFact asked the fiscal research staff whether such a system would \"force\" North Carolinians into a single-payer plan.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Plan described in the bill does not seem to kick anyone off their current insurance, but it also says \u2018all residents shall be covered so I would expect most people would voluntarily drop their existing coverage rather than pay for double coverage,\" said David Vanderweide, a fiscal researcher for the N.C. legislature.\nWhile the bill was introduced by nine Democrats, a single-payer health care plan isn\u2019t in the\u00a0N.C. Democratic Party platform, spokesman Robert Howard noted. Neither is the pledge Republicans reference, Howard added.\nA pledge: \u2018Universal, affordable health care\u2019\nThe GOP ad refers to a platform pushed by Future Now, a left-leaning advocacy group. The group has seven main goals, which are listed at FutureNow.org and\u00a0AmericasGoals.org.\nOne of the goals is \"affordable, quality healthcare.\" As part of this goal, the group wants to see \"universal, affordable health coverage with a cap on out-of-pocket expenses.\" The group thinks reaching this goal could ultimately end hunger and boost life expectancy rates to 84 years.\nThe GOP ad mentions 55 people who signed the pledge to work toward the Future Now goals. The true number is even higher, according to Future Now spokeswoman Alyssa Cass. More than 65 House members are listed on the\u00a0Future Now website.\nAs for the pledge, there\u2019s an important distinction to be made between single-payer health care and universal health care, said Daniel Squadron, Future Now executive director. One refers to who\u2019s paying for the coverage, while the other refers to how many people are covered.\nIt\u2019s not fair to equate Future Now\u2019s goals with a bill exploring single-payer health care, Squadron said. Future Now supports expanding Medicaid in North Carolina but hasn\u2019t endorsed any specific legislation, Squadron said, adding that the GOP is distorting the truth about his group to scare North Carolinians out of voting for Democrats.\n\"I would\u2019ve thought that the idea of people across the country having access to health care wouldn\u2019t be controversial,\" he said. \"Apparently for the GOP attacking it, that\u2019s not a valuable goal worth working towards, so that\u2019s surprising and disturbing.\"\nDallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, pushed back at the notion that Future Now doesn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t support a single-payer health care system. Future Now\u2019s founder, Jeffrey Sachs, wrote an\u00a0op-ed for CNN\u00a0advocating for a \"Medicare for All\" system along the lines of what Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed \u2014 a single payer plan.\n\"The economics of Medicare for All championed by\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0are actually quite straightforward,\" Sachs wrote. \"Under what advocates call \u2018M4A,\u2019 health care coverage would expand while total spending on health care \u2014 by companies, individuals and the government \u2014 would decline because of lower costs. More would be paid through the government and less through private insurers.\"\nWoodhouse noted that Squadron, for his part, praised a\u00a0single-payer health care proposal\u00a0when he was a state senator in New York and chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Group.\nThose statements by Sachs and Squadron, Woodhouse said in an email, show that Democrats \"have signed a pledge to enact universal health care coverage, which by the founders\u2019 own stated opinion would be a single-payer system. All North Carolinians would be forced through massive tax increases to pay into Insko\u2019s radical single-payer proposal.\"\nWhile Woodhouse argues the terms \"single-payer,\" \"Medicare for all\" and \"universal health care\" all mean the same thing, each term can have a different meaning. The\u00a0Vox.com news site noted\u00a0that public support varies for each term.\nA\u00a0Kaiser Family Foundation poll\u00a0found a majority of respondents have favorable views of \"Medicare for all\" and \"universal health care.\" The term \"single-payer,\" which appears most often in the GOP ads, got far less support.\nOur ruling\nThe N.C. GOP says part of the Democrats\u2019 agenda is to \"force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme\" that would cost $72 billion.\nAs for implementing a single-payer healthcare system, the GOP is right about the potential cost. But they\u2019re misleading voters about what the bill would do, who supported it and what the Future Now pledge represents. The bill directed a study \u2014 not implementation of a single-payer health system. It was sponsored by 10 Democrats and hasn\u2019t been pushed by the party as a whole. The Future Now pledge, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t specifically endorse a single-payer health care system.
