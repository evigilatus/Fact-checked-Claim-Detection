John McCain to die from a brain tumor originally came from a parody website looking to troll conservatives.\nThe headline on a July 20, 2017, post on DailyThings.world read, \"Barack Obama tweets sick attack on John McCain, says he should have died.\" Facebook users flagged the story here and on NewsFeedHunter.com as being potentially fabricated, in an effort to cut down on fake news.\nThe story included an image of a July 19 tweet from Obama that read, \"John McCain is NOT a war hero. If there were any God in heaven, he would have died from that brain tumor.\" The post said Obama quickly deleted the tweet.\n\nThe story came on the heels of the announcement that McCain, R-Ariz., was diagnosed with a brain tumor called a primary glioblastoma. The American Brain Tumor Association said that a 2009 study showed almost 10 percent of patients may potentially live five years or longer. The 80-year-old is considering treatment options.\nMcCain returned to the U.S. Senate for votes on Republican health care reform, most recently casting a deciding vote against a last-ditch \"skinny repeal\" bill to end the Affordable Care Act.\nBut let\u2019s be clear: This story is completely fake.\nThere was no such tweet for Obama to delete. It was no doubt the product of any number of websites that allow you to create a fake tweet that appears to come from another account.\nThe only thing Obama tweeted on July 19 were words of encouragement for McCain, whom Obama defeated in the 2008 presidential election.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"John McCain is an American hero & one of the bravest fighters I've ever known.
