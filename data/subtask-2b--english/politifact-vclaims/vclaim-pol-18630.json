(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nOne post that shared the quote refers to a post in a forum on Democratic Underground as a source. In the forum, someone shared a screenshot of a grammatically problematic tweet that said: \"VP Joe Biden has a speech impediment and Christie told Trump to interrupt him as much as possible, hoping Biden will be loose his cool.\"\nIt wasn\u2019t the only account to make that claim.

We found multiple social media posts sharing the statement, but nothing to corroborate them.\u00a0\nOn ABC News after the presidential debate on Sept. 29, Christie said the plan was for Trump to be aggressive but that it was \"hotter than it was planned to be\" and that he could \"potentially turn that heat down\" going forward.\nChristie also addressed Biden\u2019s performance, and he said that he thought Trump\u2019s interruptions \"saved him\" at times when Biden was \"not seeming on the ball, getting numbers wrong, wandering in mid-sentence, not being able to finish thoughts.\"\nStill, there\u2019s no record of Christie giving the advice that we could only trace to posts on social media and an online forum.
