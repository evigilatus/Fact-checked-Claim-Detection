If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen.\"\nReaders asked us to check if the propositions won\u2019t raise their taxes and also whether property taxes are frozen for homeowners 65 or older. We put the mailer\u2019s claim to the Texas Truth-O-Meter.\nThe \"freeze\" claim is inaccurate, Travis County officials quickly said to our inquiries, and it\u2019s inaccurate to say the propositions won\u2019t cost taxpayers anything extra.\nTravis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, who voted with colleagues to place the two bond propositions on the ballot before helping to kick off the privately funded Travis Forward campaign, speculated that consultants behind the mailer assumed the county, like the Austin school district, provides tax freezes to homesteading homeowners 65 or older.\n\"No doubt, this is inaccurate,\" Eckhardt said by phone. \"To the extent I am responsible, I fall on my sword.\"\nBy phone to our inquiry, Marya Crigler, chief appraiser of the Travis Central Appraisal District, noted that by state law, every Texas school district must set a ceiling on how much homeowners 65 or older pay. Counties and other governmental jurisdictions have the local option of setting such ceilings, Crigler advised. See TCAD\u2019s breakdown of exemptions and tax ceilings offered by Travis County jurisdictions here.\nEckhardt helped us reach Mykle Tomlinson, Travis Forward\u2019s campaign manager, who said by phone the errors occurred in mailers targeting older residents because consultants whom he did not identify misunderstood the difference between a homestead tax exemption and a tax freeze.\nAfter our inquiry, Tomlinson said the group would follow up by sending postcards within a day or so to the 12,295 households that received the mailer, which went out about the day the early-voting period began Oct. 23, 2017.\nAt our request, Tomlinson emailed us a copy of the follow-up postcard which says on its front: \"We were wrong and we\u2019re sorry!\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe back of the postcard is headlined: \"Setting the record straight.\" Next comes text saying: \"The mailer we sent to your home last week wrongly claimed that, like school district taxes, senior homeowners\u2019 county taxes are frozen under state law.\"\nThe back also says: \"State law does not require a county tax freeze for seniors. The mailer we sent to your home last week was inaccurate, and we\u2019re sorry. Please help us set the record straight by sharing this with your friends and neighbors.\"\nBruce Elfant, Travis County\u2019s tax assessor-collector, told us by phone that if the county propositions win approval, older homeowners will pay more in county taxes.\nAccording to the county, the owner of a home at the 2017 average taxable property value of $305,000 can expect to pay no more than $24 a year for 20 years should voters approve Proposition A, to spend $93.4 million on road, sidewalk, bike and other transportation-related projects, and Proposition B, devoting nearly $91.5 million to parks and land conservation projects.\nA county web page enables anyone to input any taxable property value--for homeowners, meaning the value, less exemptions including the county\u2019s 20 percent homestead exemption--and see what the county estimates as the proposed bonds\u2019 future annual costs to the property owner.\nAlthough the county has no tax freeze for older residents, it does give them an additional homestead exemption up to $80,000 on the assessed value of their home. That is, county taxes accrue\u00a0on the property\u2019s taxable\u00a0assessed value above $80,000 for those 65 and older.\nOur ruling\nTravis Forward said in a mailer: \"The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen.\"\nNeither claim holds up, we found, in that the propositions pose future tax costs for property owners with specific projected amounts driven by\u00a0the assessed value of properties and\u00a0the county doesn\u2019t freeze taxes for homeowners 65 or older. Rather, such a resident qualifies\u00a0to exempt\u00a0$80,000 of the taxable assessed value of their home from county taxes.\nWe rate this two-part to-be-retracted\u00a0claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.
