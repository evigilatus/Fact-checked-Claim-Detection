The copies we saw on Facebook and Twitter indicate that the money disappeared mysteriously. One of the articles, which he shared over 6,000 times on Facebook, said: \"The question of the contract: where is the $50 billion approved in 2006 for the safe fence law that Obama was supposed to build?\" Another article said: \"Where is the $50 billion allocated to the 2006 Safe Fence Act? It was signed by Bush and was supposed to oversee Obama's construction. Where's the money?\" These articles were referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here the problem lies in the missing financial claims: Congress did not approve $50 billion for the fence in 2006. (Snobs have already dismantled these articles in social media.) In 2006, Congress approved $1.2 billion for the fence, slightly more than half of the Democrats in the United States Senate voted in favour of security law in 2006, including Barack Obama, Chuck Schommer and Hillary Clinton. Most of the Democrats in the House voted against it, including the Republic of California Nancy Belusi. President George W. Bush signed the Convention into law in October 2006. The law authorized a fence about 700 miles from the United States-Mexico border. By 2015, 654 miles had been completed. We read several stories on the paragraph of the law in 2006. None of the costs were determined anywhere close to $50 billion. The law on the safe fence did not mention the money to be spent on duel. The Congress separately approved a $33.7 billion spending bill for the Ministry of National Security, which includes $1.2 billion for border fencing, infrastructure and technology. The news articles described the $1.2 billion as an initial payment, but there was disagreement over the full cost of the fence. The press and politicians cited estimates ranging from $2 billion to $12 billion. Where did this $50 billion idea come from? It's not very clear. In January 2007, several news reports and an article by the Institute for Migration Policy began to mention a container of about $50 billion for the fence. These reports refer to the work of the Congress &apos; s non-partisan research service. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher, 16 January 2021, about a week before the final vote of the Senate in September, researchers released a report exploring the costs and benefits of the south-west border fence, \"a relatively new and limited phenomenon.\" They put the initial cost of building a two-tier fence at $1.2 million to $1.3 million per mile, citing the United States Army Corps of Engineers. For 25 years, the cost of one mile anywhere can increase from $16 million to $70 million per mile by degree of wear and tear. However, neither the report nor the update of December 2006 calculates the total cost. The latter document refers to the $1.2 billion allocated to internal security. The Institute for Migration Policy has already covered a total of $50 billion by taking the highest figures in the Intelligence and Security Service report - $1.3 million per mile for construction and $70 million per mile for maintenance - and then multiplying $71.3 million by 700 miles for some $49.9 billion. As soon as it reached the newspapers, the $50 billion fuelled some setbacks. Steve King, R-Yowa, said, \"These numbers are hugely magnified.\" The U.S. Republic of California Duncan Hunter criticized the Congressional non-partisan research circle: \"I call them the crowd of 'impossible mission',\" he said. The point of dialogue that Congressional research has said that the fence will cost $50 billion has been repeated for years, and reappeared in Mother Jones in 2011, NewZwick in 2015, and Boston Globe in 2017. This figure reappeared during the ongoing debate on the Trump Wall. Steve Skales of the United States, R-la, said in an article of the Jan 2 Fox News that 26 Democrats in the Senate voted in favour of the Security Act, which allocated $50 billion over 25 years to 700 miles of fence along the border. \"The security law has allowed over $50 billion over the next two decades to build and maintain hundreds of miles of new barriers,\" said Sean Hannetti of the Fox News in January 9. The Government Accountability Office stated that border patrols spent some $2.3 billion to deploy a fence between fiscal years 2007 and 2015 and built 654 miles of fences by 2015. Border patrol officials did not track funding for the acquisition and maintenance of border fences prior to the implementation of the Public Security Act 2006. In 2009, the Border Patrol estimated that the maintenance of the fence would cost more than $1 billion over 20 years. Our ruling social media asked, \"Where is $50 billion approved in '06 for the safe horse code that Obama was supposed to build?\" These functions falsely suggest that Congress approved $50 billion as part of the Security Act. In fact, the internal security bill included $1.2 billion for the fence, which was described as a first payment at the time. The allegation of approval of $50 billion appears to have come from estimates of the total wall circulated to researchers and journalists. These social sites are trying to suggest that Congress has done something awful by approving the money and not spending it, but there is no evidence that Congress has approved $50 billion for the wall. We're assessing this statement wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d9e4344-6e9a-4cb7-8f94-dc14e97a3750", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01110"}
