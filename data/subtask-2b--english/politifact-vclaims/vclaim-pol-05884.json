The deficit has not been going up; it has been coming down -- precipitously. We\u2019ve cut our deficits by two-thirds. They\u2019re below the average deficits over the past 40 years.\"\nWe have previously rated Obama\u2019s claim that \"we've cut the deficit by two-thirds\" as Mostly True. But we hadn\u2019t heard the other claim -- that today, the deficit is \"below the average deficits over the past 40 years.\" So we took a closer look.\nEconomists tend to make long-term comparisons using a measurement of the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. (The gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the overall size of the U.S. economy.) Looking at the deficit as a percentage of GDP takes account of the economy\u2019s dramatic growth since 1975. A larger economy can sustain a larger budget, and thus a larger deficit.\nUsing that yardstick, Obama\u2019s claim is on target.\nWe calculated the current deficit as a percentage of GDP by dividing the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s $426 billion deficit estimate (which was released in September) by the nearly $18 trillion estimate for GDP in 2015 (which was released in August). That works out to a deficit that\u2019s 2.4 percent of GDP.\nSo how does that figure compare? We looked at historical data for the deficit as a percentage of GDP going back to 1975, as published by the Office of Management and Budget. When we averaged those annual percentages, the average worked out to be a little under 3.2 percent.\nThat would make Obama\u2019s claim correct. Indeed, the percentage has fallen from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 2.4 percent today.\nThis may be easier to visualize through the graph below. The blue line shows the deficit as a percentage of GDP, year by year, for the last 40 years, with the red line denoting the 40-year average. Though the percentage has been quite a bit above-average for most of Obama\u2019s tenure, it has fallen significantly and has now fallen below the 40-year average, at least based on current-year estimates.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd even if you keep unusually high percentages during the Obama years out of the calculation and limit the comparison to 1975 to 2008, the current level (a deficit that\u2019s 2.4 percent of GDP) is still slightly lower than the average going back to 1975 (2.5 percent).\nIn our previous fact-checks of Obama\u2019s claims on the deficit, we\u2019ve noted that Obama has glossed over the long-term outlook, which is not as rosy. Programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will become increasingly expensive as the Baby Boom generation ages.\nThis can be seen in the following graph from the Congressional Budget Office. Over the next decade, the deficit as a percentage of GDP is set to push closer and closer to 4 percent, which is above the average level for the past 40 years. (In this graph, deficit percentage figures are shown as negative, rather than as positive in the graph above.)\n\nOur ruling\nObama said today\u2019s deficit is \"below the average deficits over the past 40 years.\"\nHe\u2019s correct when measuring the deficit as a percentage of GDP, which is the yardstick most economists tend to use when making deficit comparisons over long periods of time. Still, Obama didn\u2019t specify that he was talking about deficits as a percentage of GDP, and the comparison\u2019s accuracy depends on the absence of major budgetary and economic changes between now and time the fiscal 2015 data are finalized.\nThe claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05884"}
