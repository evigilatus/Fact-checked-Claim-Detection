I say kiddingly but I mean it. I don\u2019t care how sick you are. I don\u2019t care if you just came back from the doctor and he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it's over. You won\u2019t be around in two weeks. Doesn\u2019t matter. Hang out until November 8. Get out and vote. And then all we\u2019re going to say is we love you and we will remember you always.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #coronavirusupdate unbelievable president. pic.twitter.com/jfqNJrzxGB\u2014 Romaan Shaikh (@RUMAANSHAIKH) April 4, 2020 \nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
