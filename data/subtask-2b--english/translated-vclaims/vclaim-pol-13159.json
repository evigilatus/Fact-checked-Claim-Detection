Makulev, a former Chairman of the National Democratic Commission, received a contribution to the campaign in the amount of $25,000 from Trump, a Republican, during his unsuccessful 2009 offer to the post of Governor. On television, however, Makulev rejected the donor &apos; s one-time allegations that President Obama was born in Kenya. He said that the baby's side show -- whose credibility was distorted a few days later when Obama issued his long-term birth certificate in the United States -- was hurting Republicans by scaring the undecided voters, distracting people from important issues. \"This is so humiliating for the independents and people in this country today... who are concerned that China now has $1.1 trillion in our debt, our last year's trade deficit with them was a quarter trillion dollars. They are concerned about their work. They are concerned about their children's work. And this bullshit they're talking about on TV is doing nothing and other countries are moving too fast ahead on renewable energy, wind, and electric cars.\" Well, before McCullough starts blocking his company's electric cars, as it is now, let's take a look at those numbers and the dollar signals he's giving us. The $1.1 trillion seemed familiar, so we'll check it out first. For one source, McAulive submitted an article on March 1 of Reuters. The second paragraph of that story supports his claim: \"The Treasury Department's statements issued on Monday show that China held $1.16 trillion in December, the last month for which figures are available, compared with previous estimates of $892 billion,\" as the story says. Well, that's right. The latest figures from the US Treasury show that China had $1.154 trillion in US debt in February -- a decrease of $600 million from January. Japan was the second largest carrier, with $890.3 billion, while Great Britain III accounted for $295.5 billion. In this small background, the total federal debt as at 2 May was $14.29 trillion. Of this amount, about $9.65 trillion is called public debt, which refers to all federal securities held by foundations and individuals outside the United States Government. This includes China and other foreign States. The remaining debt - about $4.64 trillion - is maintained by the Federal Finance Bank, United States Government trust funds and other federal funds and accounts. The largest trust fund is the one that grants social security. In his second claim, Makulev used a report from the Liberal Brookings Institution that: \"In 2010, the trade deficit between the United States and China rose to over $273 billion, the highest registered bilateral trade deficit. It represents approximately 55% of the total US trade deficit.\" We checked, and that's true, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If you are curious, this year &apos; s trade deficit as of February was $42.1 billion. This represents approximately 36 per cent of the US trade deficit of $117.8 billion for the first two months of the year. Looking back, this is an open and silent case. We cannot confirm Makulev &apos; s claim that independent voters feel insulted by Donald. But he is right in his numbers: China has $1.1 trillion in American debt; our trade deficit with China was about $275 billion last year. They're both scary, they're both true.
