To emphasize the seriousness of that financial pressure, Neuman, who lost to Lebensky in 2018, cited statistics showing eyes. \"We're now in a situation where 80% of the country lives a salary to a salary that's unacceptable,\" said WCPT, a Chicago radio station. .......................................................................................................................................................................................... However, 80% of the living salary to the salary seemed appallingly high, so we decided to take a closer look. We asked about the missing context of the Newman campaign in terms of its number, and a speaker sent several news articles, all related to an online survey conducted on the recruitment website of Boulder. A press release issued by the Permanent Buildinger company describes the results of the Harris Paul survey among adults working full-time in private companies between 2016 and 2017. The press release divides the numbers somehow Newman didn't: 38% of employees said they sometimes live their salary to salary, 17% said they usually do, and 23% said they always do. However, Craig Stephen Brown, a research partner at the Urban Institute studying economic opportunities, said that it was \"at best inappropriate\" to include nearly 40% of people who only report \"sometimes\" living salary to salary in total. To be clear, this isn't about Newman alone. Both Polidler and several articles referring to the survey confirmed that the total exceeded the specific distribution. There are other problems in taking 80 per cent (78 per cent, to be exact) in nominal terms. For example, the release of Bolidler does not clarify the questions raised in the survey, making it unclear what participants were asked to consider when assessing whether they actually \"live their salary on their salary.\" The polling experts with whom we spoke said that it was important to know the type of detail when assessing the quality of survey results. \"If you ask people to look at a percentage of any kind without also providing people with access to basic information on data collection, you really ask people to take something on faith,\" said Nora Kate Schaeffer, Vice-President of the American Association for Public Opinion Research. We called Balder's career and asked for more information on their 2017 survey. A speaker told us that the site no longer kept it. Facebook, mentioned on January 11, 2021 in an article in Facebook by Nancy Belusi, is no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. In fact, an opinion poll conducted in 2014 by Harris, the same organization that subsequently conducted the Polder job poll, found that 46% of non-retired adults in the United States say that they \"live their salaries and cannot afford to save money.\" A recent report by the Urban Institute analysed the survey data from 2017 and found that 32 per cent of non-old adults in the United States had experienced some form of financial distress in the previous 12 months. In a survey included in the U.S. Office of Consumer Financial Protection Report 2017 on Financial Welfare, respondents asked whether they \"have difficulty managing their expenses\" and found that 43 per cent of adults in the United States said they did. A survey conducted for a similar report by the Federal Reserve in 2018 found that if four out of ten adults faced unforeseen expenditures of $400, they would not be able to cover them or would have to sell something or borrow to do so. This fact has been mentioned - with varying degrees of precision - in many other recently verified allegations. As described in Builder &apos; s release, her survey appointed a subgroup of adults in the United States who had not yet retired. Experts said that this might help to explain why the results seemed unclear from similar polls that had inquired about a wider range of respondents. Our governor, Newman, said, \"We're in a position now where 80% of the country lives a salary to a salary.\" Its claim is based on the results of a survey conducted in 2017 commissioned by a post site that provided little detail beyond the worrying figures at the highest line. The website also noted, however, that 38% of these respondents said that they lived on a salary for \"sometimes\" instead of \"usually\" or \"always.\" The surveys that have raised similar questions in recent years have yielded results of financial distress that may still be of concern, but have not been anywhere as severe as the numbers highlighted by the functional polyder and repeated by Neuman. The Newman claim accurately reflects the only survey on which it relies, but it seems unclear between similar polls. We value Newman's claim for half the right. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context.
