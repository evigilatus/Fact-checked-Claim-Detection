Rick Scott why he was \"excited to believe that the vast majority of scientists who say that this man is contributing to climate change.\" Instead of answering the question directly, Scott claimed that he had already taken action to protect the environment, including addressing sea-level rise. \"We spent $350 million dealing with sea level rise down in Keyes, or down in Miami. We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars dealing with coral reefs,\" he said. Scott filed a similar claim in the discussion at Broward College on 15 October. Scott &apos; s claim, particularly about investing in projects to combat sea-level rise, stands out to us. Under Scott, did the state spend $350 million dealing with sea level rise in Miami and hundreds of millions protecting coral reefs? Did Scott invest hundreds of millions to help the coral reefs? We asked Scott's campaign speaker to provide details on spending on both projects. For coral reefs, Jackie Schutz Pulitti reported that the state spent $100 million on key protection. These funds resulted from the State authorization of the key company to upgrade the sewage and septic tanks to a modern sewage system. Improving water quality can help coral reefs. In 1999, when the Bush pocket was Governor, the State requested that Keyes comply with sewage standards that require modern sewage drainage by 2010. This deadline will be extended later until 2015. To achieve this goal, when Charlie Christ was Governor, the Legislature approved a bill in 2008 allowing for a link of $50 million per year for four years for the wastewater programme. The draft law states that \"from 1 July 2010, the legislature shall analyse the ratio of State debt to expected revenues before authorizing the issuance of any bonds under this article.\" No money was actually submerged during Christ's administration, which coincided with stagnation. Scott took office as Governor in 2011. The first year the state disposed of the money was in 2012. But next year Scott, together with the legislative leaders, decided not to issue bonds because of concerns about the ability of the State to repay its debts, according to an article in the Florida Keys Knutter newspaper. In 2014, the mandate paid another $50 million. In August 2014, Scott's campaign \"Let's Maintain the Beautiful Florida Plan,\" which included a promise to invest another $100 million in the Keyes Waste Water Project. So what does the sewage system have to do with coral reefs? Chris Berg of the Islands Nature Conservation Organization said that central wastewater treatment prevents nutrients and other pollutants from entering near-shore water. The treatment of bacterial wastewater kills human waste that can cause coral diseases. \"It was a great good for Keyes and the population, but it wouldn't affect sea level rise in any way other than the most strange ways,\" said Berg. It was published on January 25, 2021 in a video that says Bill Gates \"at least 3 billion people must die\" from this planet. \u2022 On January 27, 2021, a spokesman for Scott's office, John Tubbs, sent us a list of what more than $350 million said \"to address flood mitigation and sea level rise.\" These projects were managed by various government agencies and included the following, in addition to $100 million for sanitation in the Keyes: $21 million to update the flood map; $122 million for beach protection projects; $5 million for the coastal zone management programme; $80 million for flood mitigation in Florida in coastal communities; and $25 million for renewable loan projects in the Keyes wastewater project. The first thing we're going to point out is to get $350 million from Scott that counted $100 million to install a sewage system in Keyes, although the aim of that project was not to deal with sea-level rise. We asked environmental experts whether these additional projects should be considered as steps towards combating sea-level rise. They told us that although these projects have their advantages, they are not long-term solutions to sea-level rise. For example, better flood maps help to identify flood-prone properties under today's conditions, but they do not deal with future sea level rise, as Berg said. These are pilot beach maintenance and flood-related projects. Scott did not take steps that scientists say would address future sea level rise, such as limiting coal-fired power plants. The professor of oceanography at the University of Florida Jeff Chanton said that if beach protection projects refer to sand pumping on the beach, this is \"a short-term temporary rehabilitation ineffective.\" Chanton was one of the scientists who met Scott this summer and urged him to take action on climate change. Scientists have shown Scott how the 2-foot sea level rise expected by 2048 will swallow up a lot of Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. They called upon Scott to reduce or eliminate coal-fired power plants; to destroy the state of carbon emissions from natural gas and oil-fired energy; and to develop more alternative energy options. Scientists noted that sea-level rise had already caused flooding in Miami Beach at the high tide. We have also looked for several government officials in the provinces of Broward and Miami-Dade, as well as in the cities of Miami and Miami Beach, to see whether they had received State funds to combat sea level rise. No one can identify a specific project. \"I have no idea what he's talking about. It was the first time I heard, \"The Monroe Heather Carruthers County Commissioner, who serves in the Regional Climate Change Agreement in South-East Florida, said in an interview with Keys Kinuter Florida. Our referee Scott said during the CNN debate, \"We spent $350 million dealing with sea level rise\" in the Miami region and \"hundreds of millions of dollars dealing with coral reefs.\" The State has spent $100 million to help Keyes upgrade the sewage system, which should improve water quality - a benefit for coral reefs. Scott overlooks that it was under Christ that the legislature passed a law that paves the way for money, and it is wrong to claim that it is \"hundreds of millions.\" Scott &apos; s office also referred to a list of projects including flood mitigation, flood maps and beach protection -- throwing at $100 million for the sewage project -- to present its claim for approximately $350 million to deal with sea level rise. While these include interesting projects, experts say that they are not directly related to addressing future sea-level rise. These are pilot projects for Florida, not new measures to address climate change. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b018571a-a6da-4df3-bb12-dc2a0e1f93ed", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07065"}
