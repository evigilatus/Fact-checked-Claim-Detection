But did Klansmen crowd the 1924 convention? Well, there was a gathering of the KKK across the Hudson River on\u00a0the 10th day of the\u00a0political convention that year \u2014 but this\u00a0photo that's making the rounds on social media\u00a0is not from that event.\nHere's what we know.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Democratic National Convention was held at Madison Square Garden in New York in 1924. Back then, according to the New York Times, the KKK was \"the most powerful bloc in the Democratic Party.\"\nIt was the longest convention in American history, the paper reported in the March 15, 2016, story, replete with fistfights, roosters and the defeat of a resolution some delegates proposed that would have condemned the KKK.\nThe convention is often referred to as the \"Klanbake,\" according to Politico. During the convention, 20,000 klansmen attended a rally across the river in New Jersey. But the photo pictured in the Facebook post isn\u2019t from that rally, or from the convention. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, Arthur Vinje, a photographer for the Wisconsin State Journal, took it in Madison, Wisconsin, on Dec. 2, 1924. Klansmen were parading down King Street to Schroeder Funeral Home for the funeral of a police officer, Herbert Dreger.\nOur ruling\nThough the 1924 Democratic National convention did come to be known as the klanbake, the photograph the Facebook post alleges was taken there is actually a picture from several states away as Klansmen walked to a funeral service.\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01037"}
