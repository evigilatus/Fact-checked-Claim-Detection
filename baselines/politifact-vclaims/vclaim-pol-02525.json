This map is clearly not that.\"", "truth_label": "barely-true", "date": "stated on January 10, 2018 in Press release:", "title": "NC GOP: a gerrymander is 'a strange looking monster drawing'", "text": "A panel of judges on Tuesday struck down North Carolina\u2019s election districts for U.S. Congress, and the state\u2019s Republican leaders aren\u2019t happy.\nThe panel was unanimous in ruling that North Carolina lawmakers under Republican leadership violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s equal-protection clause when they drew maps explicitly to favor their party. It was the first time federal judges have struck down congressional districts as partisan gerrymanders.\nNorth Carolina has been at the center of election map battles since 2011, when some sued the state for what they called unfair congressional and legislative maps.\nThe decision drew swift rebukes from Republican lawmakers and organizational leaders. Some said they\u2019ll appeal and some questioned a judge\u2019s impartiality.\nRobin Hayes, chairman of the N.C. GOP, issued a statement suggesting that the judges\u2019 understanding of gerrymandering is warped. Hayes focused on geographic shapes, noting that the ill-fated maps kept 87 of North Carolina's 100 counties whole and divided only 12 precincts.\n\"A \u2018gerrymander\u2019 is by definition and common understanding, a strange looking \u2018monster\u2019 drawing. This map is clearly not that,\" Hayes said in a Jan. 10 statement. \"Judge Wynn is not being a judge, he is acting as a pundit by trying to impose his liberal beliefs instead of making a judicial ruling.\"\nThe origin of the term\nThe term \"gerrymandering\" comes from the 1800s, when a critic of newly-drawn election maps compared one of the districts to a salamander. And Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the N.C. GOP, referenced the term\u2019s origins when he emailed PolitiFact to explain Hayes\u2019 claim.\n\"It is important to note that this definition accompanied an \u2018eye\u2019 test,\" Woodhouse said. \"In other words the meaning of the word came WITH a illustration that showed a bizarre looking districts, something many people would object to just based on how they look.\"\nHayes and Woodhouse share the view of state Senate leader Phil Berger, who falsely claimed last year that North Carolina has the \"strictest anti-gerrymandering standards in the country.\" Berger\u2019s argument, like the N.C. GOP\u2019s, was based on the idea that compact districts that keep counties intact are therefore fair.\nWhile initial claims of gerrymandering focused on district shapes, and experts say district shapes can be an indicator of gerrymandering, they aren\u2019t the lone test of whether something is gerrymandered.\n\"The history of using gerrymandering to partisan advantage goes all the way back to the original use of the term for tilting state senate districts in Massachusetts,\" said Moon Duchin, associate professor of mathematics and Senior Fellow at Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University.\n\"These days, with incredibly rich data available to the line-drawers, very skewed districts no longer have to look like exotic reptiles with fangs and claws,\" Duchin said in an email. \"The current map in North Carolina is a great example \u2013 it is an extreme outlier, more favorable to Republicans than 99.5% of maps produced by a neutral process.\"\nTypes of gerrymandering\nThere are three main types of gerrymandering, as explained by Vox:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s partisan gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts to favor one party. (On Tuesday, judges ruled that North Carolina\u2019s congressional maps are unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders meant to favor Republicans.)\nThere\u2019s racial gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts that dilute the influence of a particular race or community.\nThere\u2019s even bipartisan gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts that protect incumbents in both parties.\n\"The North Carolina court adopted the same definition of partisan gerrymandering as the Supreme Court: a district plan that aims to benefit a particular party and in fact does so severely, durably, and unjustifiably,\" said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor from the University of Chicago. \u00a0\n\"That North Carolina's districts are not as ugly as in previous years is neither here nor there. You can obviously have nicer-looking districts that still intentionally and dramatically favor one side over the other,\" Stephanopoulos said.\nCheck out this explanation by the Washington Post, which includes a helpful graphic, for a visual representation of Stephanopoulos\u2019 argument.\nStephanopoulos and Eric McGhee, a public policy fellow at University of California-Berkeley, created a new measure known as the \"efficiency gap\" -- the difference between the two parties' wasted votes, divided by the total votes cast -- which is a focal point in the partisan gerrymandering case from Wisconsin that was argued at the U.S. Supreme Court in October. (Wasted votes are when voters are shifted into districts where their votes won\u2019t matter, either because their party\u2019s candidate can\u2019t win or is already sure to win.)\nMcGhee said the courts haven\u2019t cemented district shapes as a requirement of gerrymandering.\n\"I\u2019m not a lawyer, so I can\u2019t give a legal opinion,\" McGhee said in an email. \"But the question of whether a gerrymander requires funny-shaped (\"non-compact\") districts is not a matter of settled law or definition.\"\nHe said defenders of the Wisconsin assembly and NC congressional maps have argued that non-compactness is required.\n\"But the lower courts have not been sympathetic so far. [It] remains to be seen what SCOTUS will say,\" McGhee said, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nDuchin noted that there are three high-profile cases where courts plan to explore methods for measuring partisan gerrymandering.\n\"None of them emphasizes district shapes,\" he said.\nAs for the shapes of NC\u2019s congressional districts and whether they resemble monsters, some Washington Post reporters say they see not only ghastly images\u00a0\u2013 but also at least one squirrel, dog and Sherlock Holmes, among other things.\nNC GOP says their districts can't be gerrymanders because gerrymanders are \"strange looking monster drawings\" and \"this map is not that.\" NC-2 literally looks like a monster eating Raleigh. https://t.co/VGmppXW7NI pic.twitter.com/1TMcspA6s9\u2014 Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) January 10, 2018\n\n\nOur ruling\nHayes said a gerrymander is \"by definition and common understanding, a strange looking \u2018monster\u2019 drawing,\" insinuating that North Carolina\u2019s Republican-drawn maps can\u2019t be gerrymanders if the districts have smooth edges and look nice. While he\u2019s right that weird shapes can be indicators of gerrymanders, shapes are not the lone determining factor. And there\u2019s more than just one definition of gerrymandering.
