House of Representatives, said it\u2019s an overwhelming consensus.\n\"The one thing where we\u2019ve seen nearly unanimous \u2013 well, nothing\u2019s unanimous \u2013 but 80 percent support out there is the concept that men should not be in women\u2019s restrooms, changing rooms, bathrooms, et cetera \u2013 that that shouldn\u2019t happen,\" Moore said in a May 5 discussion with reporters.\nWe looked into polling on bathroom policy and found a wide range of results. Most don\u2019t reach 80 percent, but clearly substantial numbers of people in North Carolina have told pollsters they oppose letting transgender people choose what bathroom to use.\nPolls have found safety concerns are also on some people\u2019s minds.\nNo one can say that there will never be any privacy or safety issues \u2013 of course there could be. But in a previous fact check, we looked for instances of sexual predators using the cover of transgender-friendly bathroom laws to dress up as the other sex and prey on people in bathrooms, the scenario many have said they\u2019re concerned about.\nWe found it Mostly True that such a scenario has never happened. We didn\u2019t give it a True because there have been a few unproven allegations in the U.S. and one conviction in Canada.\nThe Obama administration also hasn\u2019t put stock in those concerns, and has said banning transgender people from the bathroom of the gender with which they identify is a civil rights violation.\nIt was in that context, along with the administration\u2019s threat to withhold federal funding from North Carolina, that Moore made his \"nearly unanimous,\" \"80 percent\" claim.\nUncertainty abounds\nWe did find one poll from the conservative Raleigh-based Civitas Institute that was close to backing up Moore\u2019s claim. We\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s the poll he was citing or if he was citing a poll at all \u2013 Moore didn\u2019t respond to our questions \u2013 but we\u2019ll proceed anyway.\nThe poll asked: \"Do you agree or disagree with a Virginia federal court ruling ordering girls and boys in public middle schools to share locker room, bathroom and shower facilities?\nThe poll did find that 80 percent of people said they disagreed with the court ruling. However, we have several issues with the question.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question is not only leading and inflammatory but also fundamentally misconstrues what the court ruled.\nNo boys and girls were ordered to shower, change or use the bathroom together. Instead, a federal appeals court ruled that a judge in Virginia had to reconsider a transgender boy\u2019s request to use the boys\u2019 facilities at school.\nThe court also said the Obama administration acted legally in defining sex-based discrimination to include discrimination against transgender people. That\u2019s the part that may have given rise to the poll question\u2019s wording, since the student is likely to win now.\nYet the Obama administration has repeatedly said that although schools should recognize transgender students\u2019 rights, schools should also recognize other students\u2019 right to privacy and that no student should be forced to openly share a changing area.\nIn school districts around the country that have already recognized transgender students\u2019 gender identities, officials have typically put private stalls in locker rooms and/or offered unisex one-person bathrooms.\nGiven the issues with that question, let\u2019s look at another. Another earlier poll from Civitas asked people a more accurate and nuanced question about transgender people in bathrooms, describing the arguments on both sides. This poll came before the state overturned Charlotte\u2019s LGBT ordinance.\n\"The Charlotte City Council passed a new bathroom ordinance for transgender people that allows biological men and biological women, who identify as the opposite sex, to use the bathroom or locker room of their choosing,\" the question stated, asking people to pick sides.\nNearly 70 percent said they opposed the idea. Not 80 percent, but close.\nBut what about polls from groups with less political bias?\nAccording to a joint poll from SurveyUSA in partnership with Time Warner Cable News, 51 percent of North Carolinians think transgender people should not be able to choose which bathroom to use. That\u2019s not \"nearly unanimous\" like Moore said; it\u2019s barely a majority.\nAnother joint poll from SurveyUSA and a different TV station, WRAL, found 56 percent in agreement that transgender people shouldn\u2019t be able to choose which bathroom to use \u2013 again, a majority, but not close to 80 percent.\nOur ruling\nA prominent conservative group, Civitas, did find 70 and 80 percent in two polls, although we had some serious doubts about the question that found the 80 percent support.\nTwo polls from\u00a0the less partisan SurveyUSA in partnership with local TV stations have found 56 percent and 51 percent of North Carolinians support the idea. That\u2019s still a majority, but it\u2019s certainly not the \"nearly unanimous,\" \"80 percent support\" that Moore claimed.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/49f0e634-7574-479d-ae14-5c89d8dee47e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04965"}
