Eric Greitens relayed the story of a small-business owner from Bolivar, Missouri. His business was forced to pay $1,500 a year for landline phones due to an outdated state regulation.\n\n\n\"When we came into office, we saw that Missouri had 113,000 regulations,\" Greitens wrote\u00a0in the post. \"That\u2019s more than 7.5 million words; it\u2019s 40 dictionaries worth of regulations.\"\n\n\nThe purpose of Greitens\u2019 post was to launch\u00a0NoMORedTape.com, his website that allows Missourians to crowdsource comments on laws and rules. On the site, constituents can voice their displeasure with any government regulations disrupting their everyday lives.\n\n\nIts goal is to remove unnecessary regulations, and keep rules that benefit Missourians.\n\n\nForty dictionaries of regulations seems excessive. Let\u2019s see how close Greitens\u2019 claim is to reality.\n\n\nRegulations vs. statutes\n\n\nWhen the Missouri General Assembly passes a statute, its role in the lawmaking process is done. Now, to enforce the laws, that\u2019s up to agencies in the executive branch. Regulations provide detail to statutes.\n\n\nAccording to Maura Browning, director of communications for the Secretary of State\u2019s office, individual agencies have their own set of rules for creating regulations. Once they follow their process for making a regulation, it becomes part of the\u00a0Code of State Regulations.\n\n\nThere are 22 separate titles in the code, many with dozens of chapters under multiple divisions. These encompass the 113,000 regulations Greitens was talking about in his post.\u00a0Title 4, the Department of Economic Development, alone has 369 chapters.\n\n\nWhen you go to the No MO Red Tape website, a George Mason University study pops up explaining where the large number came from. The university used a tool it developed called StateReg data, an algorithm that reads large regulatory documents. It processes words like \"shall,\" \"must,\" \"may not,\" \"prohibited,\" and \"required\" to indicate where there are legal restrictions or obligations in the Missouri Code of State Regulations.\n\n\nThat tool concluded that Missouri has 113,112 regulations. \"It would take an individual 418 hours, or 10 weeks, to read the entire CRS,\" the study said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Hanaway\n\n\nstated on March 17, 2016 in a debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The barber regulation here in Missouri is 10,000 words long\u2026.the book of Revelation is (also) 10,000 words long.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Andrew Kessel \u2022 March 30, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy that matters\n\n\nGreitens\u2019 main goal with the No MO Red Tape website is to allow small businesses to thrive without interference from the government. Browning pointed out that regulations also restrict local governments, school boards, counties and other local entities.\n\n\nAs of Oct. 31, Missouri citizens had submitted\u00a04,226 commentsto No MO Red Tape for various regulations. Eighty-nine percent of the comments criticized regulations. Most complaints targeted the Agriculture Department, which received 2,175 comments. Conservation was next with 658, then Public Safety with 236 comments. Finally, the Health and Senior Services department received 201 comments.\n\n\nBefore the website was established, constituents always had the option to complain to elected officials, said Lael Keiser, an MU political science professor. That\u2019s part of the basic relationship between representatives and who they represent. No MO Red Tape just makes commenting more accessible.\n\n\nThe governor\u2019s goal is to reduce regulations. One way he could do that is through appointing new heads to the state\u2019s agencies, Keiser said. Assuming the appointees share the governor\u2019s view of less government interference, they\u2019ll review the statutes and determine which regulations to throw out.\n\n\nYou can view the comments constituents made on specific regulations here.\n\n\nHow many words are in a dictionary?\n\n\nSo how does 7.5 million words of regulations stack up in dictionaries? Greitens claimed the regulations would fill 40 dictionaries. That allots roughly 187,500 words per dictionary. We got no response from Merriam-Webster in our quest to find a definite number of words in one of its dictionaries.\n\n\nThe\u00a0Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s fact page\u00a0says the second edition\u2019s entire text had 59 million words in just 336 pages. This figure dwarves the number Greitens used, but his office never clarified which dictionaries they were referring to. They also didn\u2019t specify if \"words\" meant individual entries in the dictionary, or every word on the page.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nIn a Facebook post, Greitens said, \"When we came into office, we saw that Missouri had 113,000 regulations. That\u2019s more than 7.5 million words; it\u2019s 40 dictionaries worth of regulations.\"\n\n\nThe word count of the Oxford dictionary \u2014 59 million \u2014 blows Greitens\u2019 estimate of the regulations\u2019 word count out of the water.\n\n\nWe didn\u2019t get a response from the governor\u2019s office, so it\u2019s unclear which dictionary he referred to, and whether \"words\" meant every word on the page or individual entries.\n\n\nStill, his point is valid: The Missouri Code of State Regulations is a huge document capable of filling many dictionaries.
