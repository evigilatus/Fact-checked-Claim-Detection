And today we had a Gallup poll showing 50 percent versus 11 (percent) on the other side thinking that the debt and the deficit should be dealt with by mostly spending cuts. So the Republicans are on the side of the American people here, and I think that\u2019s pretty clear.\"\n\nA reader asked if Trevi\u00f1o accurately replayed the poll results.\n\nAs we looked for the relevant results, Gallup spokeswoman Lydia Saad told us there\u2019s only one poll at issue. In the telephone poll of 1,016 adults taken July 7-10, 42 percent of respondents said they wanted their House member to vote against raising the debt ceiling, while 22 percent said they preferred a favorable vote; 33 percent were unsure. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nGallup said respondents who identified themselves as Republicans were more unified in opposition to raising the debt ceiling (60 percent opposed, 11 percent in favor) than Democrats were supportive of raising it (39 percent in favor, 21 percent opposed). Independents tilted against raising the ceiling, 46 percent to 18 percent, with 36 percent having no opinion.\n\n\"Despite intense lobbying of Congress by President Obama, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and others in the administration about the economic urgency for raising the nation's debt limit,\" the poll results\u2019 summary says, \"fewer than one in four Americans favor the general idea of raising it.\"\n\nTrevi\u00f1o\u2019s other point \u2014 that Americans favor mostly budget cuts to deal with the deficit \u2014 didn\u2019t poll as neatly as his recap suggests.\n\nAsked how they\u2019d prefer members of Congress to address the deficit, 20 percent said only by cutting spending and another 30 percent said mostly with spending cuts. Four percent favored solely tax increases, while 7 percent said they\u2019d prefer to tackle the deficit mostly by tax hikes.\n\nStill, 32 percent said they\u2019d support a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Put another way, at least 43 percent indicated some support for tax increases \u2014 most of them also backing budget cuts.\n\n\"Americans' preferences for deficit reduction clearly favor spending cuts to tax increases,\" Gallup sums up, \"but most Americans favor a mix of the two approaches.\" Its write-up closes: \"A key question to be answered in the days ahead is whether an agreement to raise the debt ceiling will include any tax increases. This is something many Republican members of Congress oppose, but most Americans do not seem to share this view.\"\n\nWe rate Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12736"}
