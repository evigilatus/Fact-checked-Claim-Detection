We found that the majority of states have not imposed such a ban. While the headline is a hoax meant to drive page views, some of the quotes in the article related to Trump\u2019s proposed ban are accurate.\nWe have been tracking Trump\u2019s promise \"for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims\" entering the U.S. and rated his efforts, which have been bogged down in litigation, Stalled.\nThe viralusa.org story that followed the headline makes no mention of states banning Sharia law. Instead, the brief story focused on Trump\u2019s effort to ban Muslims.\nThe story repeated a quote by Trump about the Muslim ban:\n\"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,\" he said.\nThe story on viralusa.org didn\u2019t explain the setting when Trump made that quote: he said it at a rally in Mount Pleasant, S.C., on Dec. 7, 2015 pointing to a statement he made earlier that day.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViralusa.org then posted the response by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. who said on CNN \"you know how you make American great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell.\"\nThe story also quoted a reply from Ben Carson: \"We do not discriminate on people based on religion\" -- again, a real quote from CNN.\n(Graham and Carson were among Trump\u2019s rivals in the GOP primary at the time.)\nWhile the vast majority of states haven\u2019t banned Sharia law, 11 states -- Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington -- enacted legislation regarding the application of foreign or religious law in state courts in recent years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nThese state laws generally ban the application of foreign laws if it violates a person\u2019s fundamental rights such as freedom of religion or speech.\nAdditionally, Texas adopted a law that requires the Texas Supreme Court to adopt rules and provide judicial instruction regarding the application of foreign laws in certain family law cases.\nThough most of the laws don\u2019t expressly ban Sharia law, critics say that they could be viewed as anti-Muslim.\nIn reality the practice of using foreign law in state courts is not uncommon and generally not controversial, experts told PolitiFact Florida in 2014. For example, parties in international contracts frequently agree to apply a specific foreign country\u2019s law to govern their agreements.\nA headline said that \"45 states just banned Sharia law,\" but the story itself contained no information about any such state bans. While there have been some states that have enacted legislation to ban the use of foreign law, at least in some circumstances, it\u2019s a gross exaggeration to say that the majority of states have banned Sharia law.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4f394e32-79c6-4b06-8dc2-3d7f5f040eb8", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02426"}
