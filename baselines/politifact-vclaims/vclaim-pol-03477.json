However, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the district by only 1.5 percentage points in 2016 -- well below the usual Republican performance -- giving Democrats hope that Ossoff could win the April 18 special election.\nPolls show Ossoff leading the multi-party field, with Republican candidates splitting the rest of the vote. If he can get to 50 percent, Ossoff could win the seat outright without having to compete in a runoff. That possibility has prompted Democrats from across the country to flood his war chest with donations.\nThe question of Ossoff\u2019s national security background first came up in the news release announcing his campaign on Jan. 5. \"A Georgia native who grew up in the Sixth District, Ossoff served Georgia as a national security staffer in Congress for five years before leaving government for the private sector,\" the release reads.\nOssoff, 30, continued to emphasize his experience on the campaign trail, such as in a campaign appearance and on this podcast.\nHowever, opponents raised questions about his experience, noting that Ossoff had worked on Capitol Hill between 2007 and 2012 but had only earned his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University in 2009. That would make him a pretty junior staffer to be touting his national security experience.\nWe decided to take a closer look.\nThe timeline\nAfter the criticism emerged, Ossoff\u2019s campaign released a timeline of his years on Capitol Hill. Here it is:\n\u2022 January 2007: Starts working for Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., as a part-time legislative correspondent, working 25-30 hours a week while attending Georgetown's School of Foreign Service.\n\u2022 May 2009: Graduates from Georgetown's School of Foreign Service.\n\u2022 Summer 2009: Spends the summer traveling before he returns to work as a legislative assistant for Johnson in August 2009.\n\u2022 January 2010: Promoted to senior legislative assistant.\n\u2022 April-July 2010: Runs Johnson's re-election campaign.\n\u2022 September 2010: Returns to Johnson's Capitol Hill office.\n\u2022 March 2012: Receives a top-secret security clearance and staffs Johnson for all work related to the annual National Defense Authorization Act.\n\u2022 Mid August 2012: Leaves Johnson's office.\nThis timeline, which appears to match the congressional staff records we were able to find, confirms that Ossoff did indeed work as a congressional staffer for five years.\nWhy this raises legitimate questions\nHowever, it\u2019s important to keep in mind some important context about Ossoff\u2019s first two years on Johnson\u2019s staff. During those two years, Ossoff was working with the office only on a part-time basis and hadn\u2019t received his undergraduate degree yet.\nMoreover, his title -- legislative correspondent -- is not exactly a lofty one. Here\u2019s how the Congressional Management Foundation describes it: \"Researches and writes legislative correspondence; conducts legislative research; assists legislative assistants as needed.\"\nIn other words, the primary job of a legislative correspondent is to answer mail from the lawmaker\u2019s constituents and to backfill for more senior office staffers when necessary.\nIn 2009, one of the years Ossoff held the position, the median salary for a legislative correspondent was $38,875, more than the $37,504 for a staff assistant and well below the next rung up on the ladder -- legislative assistant at $50,500, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what do staff assistants do? According to the Congressional Management Foundation, a staff assistant \"handles word processing, filing, faxing; responds to general constituent requests; processes tour and flag requests; staffs the front reception area, greets visitors and answers telephones.\"\nIn other words, a typical legislative correspondent is getting just $1,300 a year more than the (usually equally junior) staffer manning the reception desk.\nWhy Ossoff\u2019s situation may have been different\nOssoff\u2019s former supervisors, however, maintain that Ossoff had substantially more responsibility than a typical legislative correspondent.\nDaraka Satcher, Johnson\u2019s chief of staff from 2007 to 2009, told PolitiFact that the congressman was newly elected to the House and \"was focused more on domestic issues than national security.\"\nMeanwhile, Satcher and Johnson recognized that Ossoff, with his foreign-service school background, was precocious.\n\"Putting just any college student in that situation would be malpractice, but honestly, Jon was not a typical college student,\" Satcher said. \"He handled the issues, so we felt very comfortable\" with the unusual arrangement.\nSatcher said that he himself had some experience on national security issues from his previous work on Capitol Hill, so he was able to backstop Ossoff when needed.\nJohnson, the congressman, backed up Satcher\u2019s description.\n\"I had no military assets in my district and was not a military guy,\" Johnson told PolitiFact, \"Jon\u2019s level of information on the issue was much deeper than mine at that time. While he was a legislative correspondent, he was learning how to be a legislative assistant.\"\nJohnson\u2019s office added that Ossoff played a key role in the House\u2019s June 18, 2007, passage of H.Con.Res.80, a non-binding resolution about the civil war in northern Uganda. That occurred just a few months after Ossoff joined the office.\nJohnson said that Ossoff also handled some more mundane duties in the office, such as some information technology assignments. Still, he added, \"to say that Jon staffed me on national security, that\u2019s entirely, 100 percent correct.\"\nIs this version of events credible?\nOf course, in addition to being Democrats, both Johnson and Satcher have an incentive to see their former staffer win a seat in Congress. So we tried to determine independently whether the scenario they describe is plausible.\nWe reached out to half a dozen staffers who we determined had worked for House co-sponsors of the Uganda resolution, but we did not hear back from anyone who was able to comment either way.\nWe did, however, run everything we had learned past the staff at LegiStorm, a company founded by Jock Friedly, a former investigative and congressional reporter. The company, which is nonpartisan, collects and analyzes data about Congress. They are perhaps best known for collecting publicly available salary information about Capitol Hill staffers.\nFriedly and a researcher on his staff, Keturah Hetrick, pored over the available information for PolitiFact and concluded that there was nothing to contradict Ossoff\u2019s version of events. They said that \"it\u2019s not a stretch\" for Ossoff to have handled substantive foreign-policy issues despite his low-level position.\n\"Legislative correspondents are rarely going to be the primary staffer handling a given legislative issue, but they will also handle some policy work,\" Hetrick said.\nWhat Johnson and Satcher said \"sounds totally plausible,\" she said. At the same time, she added, official documentation is silent on whether Ossoff was officially Johnson\u2019s primary foreign affairs staffer between 2007 and 2009.\nNorman Ornstein, a longtime Congress-watcher at the American Enterprise Institute, said Ossoff\u2019s statement amounts to \"resume inflation,\" though, in his opinion, a \"rather benign\" example.\n\"Legislative correspondent is a junior staff position, but it at least requires that the staffer know enough about his boss's policy positions that he can write letters, both to constituents and executive agencies, that are accurate and in some cases nuanced,\" he said.\nA better phrasing, Ornstein said, would have been that he spent \"five years as a staffer in the U.S. Congress, including work on national security.\"\nOur ruling\nOssoff said, \"I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress.\"\nThis description certainly applies to his final three years on Capitol Hill, which were spent in middle- to senior-level foreign policy posts. Whether it applies to his first two years working for the lawmaker is less clear cut.\nHis former supervisors insist that due to unusual circumstances within the office, Ossoff handled foreign-policy duties above his pay grade during that time. An independent expert told us that the explanation is plausible.\nThat said, Ossoff at the time was an undergraduate student holding a part-time position that, in the Capitol Hill pecking order, was entry-level. That adds relevant context, and he left it out.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    3 7  Politifact Rating: Half True  \"I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress.\"    Jon Ossoff Democratic House candidate   a campaign appearance Monday, April 3, 2017 04/03/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03477"}
