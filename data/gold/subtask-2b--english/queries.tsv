2019_oct_03_221	One of the most disturbing proposals from left-wing politicians involves draining your healthcare to finance the open borders that we just discussed.
2019_nov_21_235	160 million people like their private insurance, and if they don’t like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal.
2019_nov_21_614	While I was passing the first climate change bill and that Politifact said was a game changer.
2019_nov_21_615	While I manage the $90 billion recovery plan, investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we’ve ever done it.
2019_nov_21_616	My friend was producing more coal mines and produce more coal around the world according to the press than all of Great Britain produces.
2019_oct_16_276	And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance.
2019_oct_16_299	The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs, but for people making between $50 and $75,000 year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is they’ll pay more in new taxes, 7.4% plus or 5% plus a 4% income tax.
2019_oct_16_94	Because Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.
2019_oct_16_613	Senator Warren is 100% right that we’re in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history, and a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle.
2019_oct_16_614	The problem is that it’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all of those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they’d projected.
2019_oct_16_497	As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise.
2019_oct_16_498	90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.
2019_oct_16_243	I don’t think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice and the choice of Medicare for All who want it, which is affordable for everyone because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that healthcare.
2020_feb_08_191	So I think we need to think about healthcare a little differently and that is, 36 million Americans last year couldn’t afford to have a prescription filled and that includes people with health insurance.
2020_feb_08_198	How about we start with what a president can do, I love saying this, all by herself.
2020_feb_08_199	On day one, I will defend the Affordable Care Act and I will use march in orders to reduce the cost of commonly used prescription drugs like insulin and HIV, AIDS, drugs and EpiPens.
2020_feb_08_159	Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made $100 billion in profit.
2020_feb_08_258	30,000 die because they don’t get to a doctor on time, and 500,000 people going bankrupt, for what reason?
2020_feb_08_739	Furthermore, I am very proud that today I have a D- voting record from the NRA.
2020_feb_08_483	It started with withdrawing us from the Iran nuclear deal that his own administration certified was working.
2020_feb_20_285	Number two, you know from the moment we passed that signature legislation, Mike called it a disgrace.
2020_feb_20_117	When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008, I was right here in Las Vegas, literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families.
2020_feb_20_365	And when we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95% of it out.
2020_feb_20_29	You don’t start out by saying, “I’ve got 160 million people, I’m going to take away the insurance plan that they love.” That’s just not a ways that you go and start building the coalition that the Sanders’ camp thinks that they can do.
2020_feb_20_266	It’s because last year the healthcare industry made $100 billion in profits.
2020_feb_20_268	And those CEOs are contributing to Pete’s campaign and other campaigns.
2019_nov_22_246	So he made up my phone call.
2019_nov_22_247	He made it up.
2019_nov_22_248	He made up a phone call.
2019_nov_22_249	And then when I released it, everybody was embarrassed.
2019_nov_22_621	He made up my statement, and I want to find that out.
2019_nov_22_136	And I also, by the way, going back to that, why isn't Germany putting up money?
2019_nov_22_137	Why isn't France putting up money?
2019_nov_22_138	Why isn't all of the European nations -- why are they putting up?
2019_nov_22_412	Look, the ambassador, the woman, she wouldn't even put up -- she's an Obama person, you know.
2019_nov_22_417	And by the way, when I was talking to President Zelensky, it's right on the phone.
2019_nov_22_338	But I watched Joe Biden with the prosecutor, who a lot of people said was a great prosecutor, and they took him off.
2019_nov_22_339	And he was prosecuting that company.
2019_nov_22_239	And Obama would send pillows and sheets.
2019_nov_22_240	He wouldn't send anything else.
2019_nov_22_234	I've been tougher on Russia than any president in history.
2019_nov_22_250	And crazy Nancy Pelosi, who, by the way, is going to go down as the worst speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, she hasn't done anything.
2020_jan_15_441	Look at the men on this stage.
2020_jan_15_442	Collectively, they have lost ten elections.
2020_jan_15_443	The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are the women.
2020_jan_15_636	What we will do through a Medicare for All single payer program is substantially lower the cost of healthcare for employers and workers, because we end the hundred billion dollars a year that the healthcare industry makes and the $500 billion a year we spend an the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans.
2020_jan_15_11	I said 13 years ago, it was a mistake to give the President the authority to go to war, if in fact he couldn’t get inspectors into Iraq to stop what thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon.
2020_jan_15_12	It was a mistake and I acknowledged that.
2020_jan_15_1075	My response is back in 1986, I introduced the first climate change bill and check Politifacts, they said it was a game changer.
2020_mar_16_552	I am saying that you have been on the floor of the Senate time and time again, talking about the need to cut Social Security, Medicare, and veterans programs.
2020_mar_16_858	Well all right, I mean, I think one of the differences, not to pick a bone here, is I have been consistent.
2020_mar_16_859	I’ve always believed in that and you have not.
2020_mar_16_385	The fed gave trillions and trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to every financial institution in this country and central banks all over the world.
2020_mar_16_672	So did I, and I went out and campaigned for it.
2020_mar_16_674	$15 an hour, in New York city.
2020_mar_16_675	Go to the Governor.
2020_mar_06_60	Well, actually, we are giving -- I think really given tremendous marks -- you look at Gallup poll, you look at other polls, for the way we have handled it.
2020_mar_06_390	Because you look at the son -- here's a guy, didn't have a job, was unfortunately, sadly -- the military was a very sad experience for him.
2020_mar_06_391	He goes out, he gets $3 million plus $183,000 a month to be a board member of a company that a lot of people said was corrupt.
2020_mar_06_400	So mentally I'm all set for Bernie -- communist, I had everything down, he's a -- I was all set.
2020_mar_06_441	Preexisting conditions, 100 percent, we take care of.
2020_mar_06_442	But we have many healthcare plans now, where it's 60 percent, even 65 percent less expensive than Obamacare.
2020_mar_06_297	I opened up LNG plants in Louisiana where they were for years -- for 10, 12, 14 years and longer trying to get permits -- they couldn't get permits.
2020_mar_06_661	But he said, the biggest problem we have is North Korea.
2020_mar_06_662	That's what you're alluding to.
2020_mar_06_663	And I have a good relationship with him.
2020_mar_06_664	I said, did you ever call him?
2020_mar_06_665	The answer is, yes, he did.
2020_mar_06_667	Maybe they do, but called many times.
2020_mar_06_668	And Kim Jong-un didn't want to talk to him.
2020_sep_16_70	I mean, I can show you there’s a chart that just came out a little while ago.

2020_sep_16_81	You would have very few cases.
2020_sep_16_116	Joe Biden said I was xenophobic because I put the ban on, and I thought that was a very unfair.
2020_sep_16_117	By the way, he’s totally taken that back.
2020_sep_16_216	Nancy Pelosi was standing in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco, late a month, more than a month after that saying, “This thing’s totally exaggerated, come to try and build up tourism.” And all of these people-
2020_sep_16_54	We were short on ventilators because the cupboards were bare when we took it over.
2020_sep_16_493	If you look at what they want to do, where they have socialized medicine, they will get rid of preexisting conditions.
2020_sep_16_617	If you look at his policies, where he wants to raise everybody’s taxes, you look at what he wants to do in terms of regulation, where he wants to put all of the regulations back on that I took off, and then some, and in many cases, double it up, you will have a depression, the likes of which we haven’t seen in this country, and that doesn’t affect big people.
