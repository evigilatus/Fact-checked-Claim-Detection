David Perdue of Georgia, object to taking Cuba off the list of state sponsors of terrorism.\n\"The Castro regime, time and again, has violated international norms,\u2019 Perdue, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement issued the day after the White House announcement.\n\"I am deeply concerned that President Obama continues to embolden our enemies and empower dictators from Russia to Iran, and now Cuba. Cuba must prove it is willing to change its destructive and oppressive behavior before the United States removes it as a state sponsor of terrorism.\nHe cited several examples of Cubas destructive and oppressive behavior, including an incident in 2013 when, he said, Cuba secretly shipped 240 metric tons of weapons to North Korea, violating a U.N.embargo.\nPolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Perdue\u2019s statement about the weapons shipment.\nWe reached out to Mark Bednar, a Perdue spokesman, who sent us several news accounts of the incident where aging Cuban weapons were found aboard a North Korean-flagged ship.\nIn July 2013, Fox News reported that Panamanian officials stopped the ship Chong Chon Gang ferrying undeclared weapons and armaments, including two Soviet-era MiG fighters and surface-to-air missile system, from Cuba, in apparent violation of U.N. sanctions. The weapons were hidden under 200,000 bags of sugar.\nThe report said the Cuban government acknowledged about a day later that the cargo included 240 metric tons of \"obsolete defensive weapons.\" Government officials claimed the equipment was meant to be repaired in North Korea and returned to Cuba.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree members of the ship\u2019s crew were arrested on arms trafficking charges. The ship was allowed to return to Cuba in 2014 after a $700,000 fine was paid, the BBC reported.\nA State Department spokesperson told us this week that the administration considers the weapons shipment to North Korea in 2013 an \"egregious violation of U.N. sanctions.\"\nThe administration, the spokesperson said, has worked to ensure that those responsible \"pay a price for their wrongdoing.\"\n\"The administration also worked to maximize the diplomatic cost to Cuba for its role in the incident, including repeatedly condemning Cuba\u2019s role in the violation in meetings of the UN Security Council,\" she said. \"While Cuba\u2019s actions were a clear violation of international law, they do not constitute support for acts of international terrorism and do not constitute a bar to rescission of their (state sponsor of terrorism) designation.\"\nCuban was placed on the list in 1982 because of its efforts to promote revolution in the Western Hemisphere. North Korea spent 20 years on the list but was removed in 2008 by President George W. Bush. North Korea was placed on the list in 1988 for planting a bomb on a passenger plane headed from Baghdad to Seoul. The plane exploded south of Burma, and all on board were killed.\nIn the current review of Cuba\u2019s standing, the administration focused on \u2018the narrow question of whether Cuba provided any support for international terrorism during the previous six months and whether Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future, consistent with the statutory standard for rescission,\" the State Department spokeswoman said..\nA senior administration official told reporters earlier this month that Cuban leaders, including Fidel and Raul Castro, have repeatedly and publicly decried terrorist acts.\nCongress has 45 days from receiving the president\u2019s report to pass a joint resolution prohibiting the rescission. If that would occur, the president would have veto power and Congress the power of the veto override.\nOur conclusion\nGeorgia Sen. David Perdue said he objects to plans to take Cuba off the list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that was announced last week by the White House. He said that the Castro regime in Cuba has violated international norms.\nAmong the specific examples he cited was Cuba \"secretly shipping 240 metric tons of weapons to North Korea in 2013 in violation of a U.N. embargo.\" News reports and statements from the administration back up Perdue\u2019s claim about the incident.\nThe administration said it narrowly focused on whether Cuban provided any support for international terrorism in the prior six months and whether the Cuban government had provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future, That is context the reader needs.\nFor that reason, we rate Perdue's statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06484"}
