And so is the rhetoric over the proposed 1 percent sales tax hike to fund metro Atlanta transportation projects.\n\nTransportation tax opponent Steve Brown recently told metro voters that Portland, Ore., is a cautionary tale for fans of public transit.\n\nYes, Portland. That town whose residents are so in love with its buses and rail that others mock them for it.\n\nAn attendee at a forum hosted by the Republican Women of Cherokee County called MARTA a business failure and asked panelists why the 10-year tax would fund a slate of projects that include public transit.\n\nThat\u2019s when Brown, a Fayette County commissioner, brought up Portland. He called it \"the most transit-friendly city in the United States of America.\"\n\n\"And they\u2019ve never gotten over 12 to 15 percent ridership in the past 12 years,\" Brown said.\n\nPortland?\n\nThe metro Atlanta tax, which is up for a vote July 31, would raise about $7.2 billion for road and transit projects, or as much as $8.5 billion after inflation. It would fund 157 projects in metro Atlanta, including roads, bridges and rail. No rail is slated for Cherokee County.\n\nBrown opposes the tax for a number of reasons. One is that he thinks it would fund too much mass transit.\n\nFirst, a word on \"ridership.\" Transportation policy wonks use this term to refer to a very specific thing, and it\u2019s not what Brown described.\n\n\"Ridership\" is the number of times a passenger boards public transportation. In metro Portland, that number is rising.\n\nFourth quarter 2002 data show there were about 288,000 boardings on Portland\u2019s TriMet public transit system on an average weekday, according to the American Public Transportation Association. Ten years later, it was 323,000. That\u2019s an increase of about 12 percent. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n(This does not necessarily mean more people are riding TriMet. Ridership can increase if passengers make more transfers.)\n\nWe realize, though, that average folks might not care about the technical definition of \"ridership.\" Brown spoke in percentage terms, so we think it\u2019s fair to say that the audience got the impression that he was talking about the percentage of Portland-area residents who ride transit. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBrown backed up his point by sending PolitiFact Georgia data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s yearly American Community Survey. They describe what forms of transportation commuters use to get to their jobs.\n\nThey showed that from 1997 through 2008, between 12 percent and 15 percent of Portlanders mainly used public transportation to get to work. The most recent ACS data showed this percentage remained near 12 percent from 2006 through 2010. \u00a0\n\nBrown sent us other surveys by the city of Portland that show similar results.\n\nThe share of commuters shrinks to about 6 percent when you include metro workers who live outside the city\u2019s boundaries, according to ACS data. This number has also held steady in recent years.\n\nBut commutes are only one part of the story. Riders also use it to go to school or events, to run errands, or to take trips to the airport.\n\nWe talked to Jarrett Walker, a public transit expert whom Brown suggested we contact. Walker\u2019s website is where Brown got his ACS numbers. We also talked to Alan Pisarski, an expert on road congestion and how people use different forms of transportation.\n\nPisarski said the \"lion\u2019s share\" of trips on public transit are for work, and the percentage of commuters who use it during the height of rush hour can have the greatest impact on traffic congestion.\n\nBut, Pisarski said, the ACS measures commuter behavior only.\n\nWalker thinks it\u2019s a bad idea to predict the effects of an expanded MARTA system based on Portland\u2019s experience. The success of a planned system depends more on how the land around potential stations develops.\n\n\"It doesn't matter much how many people use it occasionally or the balance between regular and occasional riders,\" Walker told PolitiFact Georgia.\n\nNationally, commuting trips make up about 60 percent of transit rides, according to data from a five-year study by the American Public Transportation Association that was released in 2007.\n\nA 2010 survey by TriMet found that 80 percent of adults in the system\u2019s service area ride it. Some 43 percent use the system occasionally, regularly or frequently.\n\nOf TriMet\u2019s frequent and regular riders, 44 percent use it primarily to travel to work while 26 percent use it primarily for school.\n\nThese percentages have held steady for the past 10 years, TriMet data showed.\n\nThe survey\u2019s sample size of 1,000 adults is small and the research was conducted by an agency with a big stake in the results, but we think TriMet\u2019s findings are reasonable. We compared its results with the ACS and found they square with each other.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nIf Brown said that the percentage of Portland adults who use public transit to get to work has stayed between 12 percent and 15 percent, his claim would have been accurate.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what he said. Brown said Portland has \"never gotten over 12 to 15 percent ridership\" of its public transit system \"in the past 12 years.\"\n\nThis gives the impression that only a tiny percentage of adults in TriMet\u2019s service area use the system. But a credible source of data shows that about 40 percent use it a couple of times a month or more. Include infrequent riders and that number climbs to 80 percent.\n\nFurthermore, \"ridership,\" as transit experts understand it, is up.\n\nBrown\u2019s statement would be correct if he were just talking about Portland commuters.\n\nBut the actual \"ridership\" (Brown\u2019s word) increases substantially when you include the people who use rail a few times a month. Throw in infrequent riders and the number skyrockets.\n\nBrown\u2019s statement is misleading and needs a lot of context to move any higher on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nHe earns a Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVernon Jones\n\n\nstated on June 3, 2010 in a candidate forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Four years as a congressman, he [U.S. Rep.
