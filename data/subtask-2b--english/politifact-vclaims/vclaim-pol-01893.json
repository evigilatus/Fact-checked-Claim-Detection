The list of claims first circulated in the form of a chain email in 2006, according to Snopes.com. Six years later, we checked several of the claims ourselves.\nWith immigration in the headlines today, these claims are popular again.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll fact-check No. 4: \"More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal.\"\nMedi-Cal is the name of California\u2019s Medicaid program, which covers low-income residents of the state. Undocumented immigrants may be eligible for health plan options through Medi-Cal, although the benefits may be limited.\nThe most recent complete data we found was from 2011.\nThat year, the state had 502,120 total births. According to Medi-Cal, 50.4 percent of the state\u2019s births that year were paid for by Medi-Cal. That works out to 253,068 total births on Medi-Cal.\nMedi-Cal also reported that 29 percent of Medi-Cal mothers in 2011 were undocumented. So that year, 73,390 undocumented mothers gave birth on Medi-Cal.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a percentage of all births in the state, that works out to about 15 percent -- not 66 percent, as the meme says.\nAfter we initially published this article, a spokeswoman for California's Department of Health Care Services provided statistics for 2012 and 2013. As it turns out, the percentage declined in those years -- to 13.4 percent in 2012 and 12.6 percent in 2013.\nIn its previous review of these claims, Snopes evaluated an earlier version of the assertion that was worded, \"Over 2/3\u2019s of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal whose births were paid for by taxpayers.\"\nSo we looked at the data for Los Angeles in 2013, the most recent year we could find on the California Department of Public Health website. That doesn\u2019t support the earlier version of the claim either.\nThat year, about 57 percent of births to residents of Los Angeles were Hispanic. But that refers to all Hispanic births -- not just those to undocumented immigrants, who accounted for only a fraction of the total Hispanic population.\nOur ruling\nThe meme says, \"More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal.\"\nThat\u2019s wrong. Between 2011 and 2013, the most recent years available, between 12 percent and 15\u00a0percent of all births statewide were to undocumented immigrants using Medicaid, not 66 percent.\nWe rate the statement False.\nUPDATE, July 5, 7:00 p.m.: This article has been updated with the most recent figures provided by California's Department of Health Care Services. The rating remains the same.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-05 16:52:50 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal.\"    Viral image on the Internet    social media postings Tuesday, July 3, 2018 2018-07-03    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01893"}
