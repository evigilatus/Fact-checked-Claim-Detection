Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who first made headlines on June 23, 2018, when she told protestors at a Los Angeles rally to put pressure on the Trump administration over its policy separating immigrant families at the border with Mexico.\nWaters has been under constant fire from conservatives \u2014 including Trump, who elevated her profile with a series of Twitter attacks \u2014 for her comments at the rally. Waters also has become a target of several false reports and internet memes.\nThe latest example: A doctored image purporting to show her telling CNN that an \"illegal immigrant\" should be nominated as the next Supreme Court justice.\n\"Waters: SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant,\" said the chyron in what appeared to be a screenshot of a CNN interview with Waters. The photo was posted to Facebook on June 28, 2018, by Trump Nation, a group devoted to supporting the president. On a ticker at the bottom of the image, Waters is quoted as saying, \"It\u2019s the only way the Democrats can ever win again.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a comment accompanying the image, the post said: \"... and this is why WE don't watch CNN... They are bat shit crazy! SHARE if you agree \u2026\"\nBut, as several media outlets were quick to point out, the image is fake.\nThe screenshot was likely lifted from an Oct. 24, 2017, interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo in which Waters explained what she had meant when she said she would \"take Trump out.\" In the original clip, Waters can be seen wearing the same attire and jewelry \u2014 and speaking in front of the same backdrop \u2014 as in the doctored photo. She makes no mention of a judicial nominee being an immigrant.\u00a0\nWe searched Google and Nexis and could not find any credible reports indicating that the doctored image was real. Trump Nation did not respond to a request for comment.\nWe rate this image Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2018-07-18 14:25:58 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says Maxine Waters told CNN, \"SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant.\"    Internet Rumors Viral Image https://www.facebook.com/RealTrumpNation/photos/a.744441295687017.1073741829.735823829882097/1283240148473793/?type=3&theater   on Facebook Thursday, June 28, 2018 2018-06-28    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01891"}
