Rob Portman features a video clip of his opponent, former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, a Democrat, saying, \"My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that,\" before the ad launches\u00a0into attacks on his economic record. \u00a0\nThe narrator says that Strickland is speaking \"on his record,\" then slams Strickland for 350,000 jobs lost and $8 million in taxes raised. PolitiFact Ohio has checked those two figures before and rated the claims Half True and Mostly True, respectively.\nNow we\u2019d like to know where Fighting for Ohio got that \"mixed and spotty\" clip. Did the former Ohio governor really fall on his sword over the economic upshot of his tenure?\nNo, he didn\u2019t. The ad takes Strickland\u2019s words\u00a0out of context.\nText under the video cites a Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board\u2019s February interview of Democratic primary Senate candidates, which is posted in its entirety on YouTube.\nThe context tells the tale. At the 26:13 mark of the interview, primary hopeful P.G. Sittenfeld asked Strickland, \"Why should Democratic voters not judge you by your record on guns?\" He criticized Strickland for reversing his anti-gun control stance, a change of heart Strickland\u2019s aides have attributed to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., that resulted in the deaths of 20 children and six adults.\nStrickland countered that he welcomed voters to judge him by his record, then changed the subject to the diversity of his cabinet appointees during his term as Ohio\u2019s governor from 2007 to 2011. But the topic snapped back to guns (at the 28-minute mark) when one of the off-camera Plain Dealer interviewers asked\u00a0Strickland to clarify his stance.\n\"Has my position changed over time? It has,\" Strickland answered. \"Can people criticize me for that? Absolutely. You\u2019re not going to find me out there saying my records with guns is not a legitimate -- you know, it\u2019s one of many issues that people will look at and make a decision about me and this race, and so on and so forth.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill O'Neill\n\n\nstated on July 30, 2010 in in a letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In recent years, Rep. LaTourette has sponsored legislation that would increase spending by 551.6 percent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Stephen Koff \u2022 August 5, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom there, Strickland tried\u00a0to explain his gun\u00a0rights position, calling President Bill Clinton\u2019s 1994 crime bill, which he voted against in Congress, \"one of the worst pieces of legislation that\u2019s been passed in decades.\" He said he dropped his NRA membership \"five or six years ago,\" and defended a recent radio interview in which he boasted about his A+\u00a0rating from the NRA in 2010. \u00a0\nStrickland\u2019s monologue concluded at the 31:40 minute mark, when he said, \"My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that.\"\nThe next 12 minutes of discussion is fixed on the candidates\u2019 stances on gun control. Not employment, not taxes.\nSteiner Public Relations in Columbus, Ohio, is fielding questions for Fighting for Ohio. Their spokesperson, Jen Detwiler, said, \"We\u2019ll let the content of the ad stand on its own.\"\nOur ruling\nAn attack ad juxtaposes employment figures and tax dollars with a video clip of Strickland saying, \"My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that.\"\nStrickland\u2019s stance on gun control may have wavered, but the context in which he made the \"mixed and spotty\" statement did not. Strickland was talking about guns, not jobs or taxes. The Fighting for Ohio PAC\u2019s \"Spotty\" ad distorts the context of his statement.\nWe rate this ad False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/02d12e26-ad74-49e5-9fff-f0ca114a71eb", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04967"}
