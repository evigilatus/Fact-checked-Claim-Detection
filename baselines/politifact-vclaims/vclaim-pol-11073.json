Brown dialed up the criticism Monday prior to a Mandel event near a GM plant in Lordstown.\n\nA headline on a news release labeled Mandel as \"anti-auto rescue.\" In the release, Friends of Sherrod Brown spokeswoman Sadie Weiner said Mandel \"would have voted \u2018no\u2019 on the auto rescue despite the fact that it saved Ohio jobs and put middle-class families back to work.\"\n\nThe claim caught PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s attention, given Mandel\u2019s trademark stealth. Had we missed a policy stand?\n\nAfter considerable research and many discussions with both campaigns, we are not convinced.\n\nBrown has been painting his opponent as anti-auto bailout since at least March, when Mandel told The Vindicator, Youngstown\u2019s daily newspaper, that he was developing a plan \"to rescue the auto industry.\" To those who thought the industry already had been rescued by the government loans to Chrysler and GM, Mandel\u2019s statement was a head-scratcher.\n\n\"I\u2019m not saying the bailout didn\u2019t work,\" Mandel told the paper. But he also said he \"respectfully disagreed\" that it saved the U.S. auto industry. Nowhere in the story is he quoted as saying he would have voted against the loans as a senator.\n\nNevertheless, Mandel\u2019s opponents pounced. Citing The Vindicator story in late March, the Ohio Democratic Party bashed Mandel in a news release that, among other gripes, stated he \"would have voted to let the auto industry die.\" The state party works closely with Brown\u2019s campaign -- so closely that Justin Barasky, the Brown campaign\u2019s communications director and a former party spokesman responded to our questions about the statement at the time.\n\nBarasky referred PolitiFact Ohio to a Toledo Free Press article from March 14 that appeared under the headline \"County Democrats criticize Mandel for opposing auto bailout.\" Barasky also pointed us to a statement from U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, a South Carolina conservative who cited Mandel\u2019s support of a \"ban on government bailouts\" when endorsing him in June 2011.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed our initial questions, we found no evidence that Mandel himself had ever confirmed he would have voted against the auto bailout. Meanwhile, both the Brown campaign and the Ohio Democratic Party continued with this line of attack.\n\nMandel could have made it easy on us by simply taking a position -- yea or nay. But true to form, he declined. Furthermore, his campaign communications director, Travis Considine, was adamant that our research was accurate: Mandel had not taken a public stance on the loans.\n\nWe followed up with both campaigns last week and again this week as Mandel traveled to the heart of Ohio\u2019s car-manufacturing belt. Barasky emailed us a clip of video footage he said comes from a February meeting with the Tea Party Express near Cincinnati.\n\n\"Your United States senator, Sherrod Brown, voted for the Wall Street bank bailout, the largest bailout of Wall Street banks in the history of the United States of America,\" Mandel says from behind a podium in the video. \"If I were there, I would have voted against it.\"\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets tricky. The Wall Street bailout is encapsulated by the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, a measure Congress passed in October 2008. After the Senate failed to reach a deal on a separate bailout for automakers, President George W. Bush, nearing the end of his administration, allocated TARP funds to Chrysler and GM.\n\nPresident Barack Obama allocated additional TARP funds to the two companies in 2009. It is important to note, though, that the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, never held an up-or-down vote on a standalone auto bailout.\n\nBrown\u2019s official support for the rescue plan came when he cast a procedural vote to quickly move on a bill that would have given the automakers emergency loans. The motion failed. Brown also voted for TARP, but at the time no TARP money had been reserved for Chrysler or GM.\n\nBarasky argues that Mandel has the benefit of hindsight, and that by declaring he would have voted against the bank bailout, he also is declaring he would have voted against the auto bailout.\n\nWhen Mandel was in Lordstown this week, a reporter for the Youngstown Business Journal asked about this very conflict. Did Mandel oppose the allocation of TARP funds to the automakers?\n\nMandel did not answer the question directly.\n\n\"When I talk to Democrats, Republicans and independents throughout the Mahoning Valley, I have not come across anyone who supports bailing out Wall Street banks,\" he said. \"I agree with Democrats, Republicans and independents in the Mahoning Valley that it\u2019s dead wrong to bail out the Wall Street banks with our tax dollars.\"\n\nSo where does all of this put the Brown campaign\u2019s statement on the Truth-O-Meter?\n\nThe senator\u2019s re-election team said Mandel \"would have voted \u2018no\u2019 on the auto rescue.\"\n\nMandel doesn\u2019t help himself by refusing to take a clear position. A voter who read his comments in The Vindicator would be hard-pressed to determine where he stands on the auto bailout. He indicated he did not think the measure was perfect, but he stopped short of speaking against it.\n\nBut PolitiFact Ohio puts the burden of proof on the speaker. And the Brown campaign was unable to show us anything in which Mandel definitively stated he would have voted against rescuing the auto industry.\n\nBy virtue of voting against TARP, a position Mandel confirms he would have taken, he would have voted against a bill that eventually benefited the auto industry. Of course in these hypotheticals, Mandel wouldn\u2019t have known that at the time, so it is intellectually dishonest to write him off as anti-auto rescue.\n\nMaybe Mandel will enlighten voters one day with his thoughts on the loans to Chrysler and GM. But for the moment, Brown\u2019s campaign is putting words in Mandel\u2019s mouth and pushing a deceiving line of attack.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11073"}
