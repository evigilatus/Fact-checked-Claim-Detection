It turns out Trump\u2019s depiction of the situation is flat-out wrong. Obama actually defended the protester's freedom of speech.\nWhat actually happened\nWhile Obama was campaigning for Clinton, rally-goers began to shout and boo at a Trump supporter in the crowd. Obama tried to calm the situation, repeatedly yelling at the crowd to \"hold up,\" \"listen,\" and \"sit down and be quiet for a second.\"\nWhen the noise settled a bit, Obama defended the protester's right to speak out.\n\"You\u2019ve got an older gentleman who is supporting his candidate, \" Obama said. \"He\u2019s not doing nothing. You don\u2019t have to worry about him.\"\nThen, Obama explained\u00a0to the Clinton supporters why they should respect this man.\n\"This is what I mean about folks not being focused,\" Obama said. \"First of all, we live in a country that respects free speech. Second of all, it looks like maybe he might have served in our military and we ought to respect that. Third of all, he was elderly and we got to respect our elders. And fourth of all, don't boo. Vote. Don\u2019t boo. Vote.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
