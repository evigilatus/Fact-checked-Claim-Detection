In a short speech at a press conference on 25 September, Raimundo argued that women should be able to make health decisions without interference from their employers or the Government. The following day, the Providence Journal stated that, in an interview after the press conference, it would oppose efforts to provide an insurance scheme on the Rhode Island Health Exchange that would exclude abortion or contraception coverage. (The Raimundo campaign later issued a statement expressing a different position. More about it later. The position of Raimundo was taken by opponents, who said that she had taken a \"big\" stance on abortion. Thomas Tobin, Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, was one of the first and most vocal critics. The Catholic newspaper Rhode Island, the parish newspaper, followed an opening on 2 October. \" [Jenna Raimundo] shows an inexplicable disregard of the true conscience of thousands of Rhode Island residents who do not want to participate in insurance programmes paying for abortion,\" she said an opening. \"Almost every other state has provided this option.\" We wondered whether almost every mandate has already provided this option. Rick Snizk, editor of the Catholic newspaper Rhode Island, told us that the source of the claim was a recent report from the United States Government Accountability Bureau. The 15 September report was prepared at the request of the Republican leaders of the House of Representatives. It considered all health exchanges in the country established under the Affordable Care Act and what options of coverage are available for abortion in each state. Under the law, exchanges are required to provide insurance to cover abortions when \"pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or the life of a pregnant woman is at risk unless abortion is performed.\" The Affordable Care Act does not require states to provide abortion coverage beyond that. In fact, the GAO report concluded that 17 states have enacted laws explicitly prohibiting health plans from providing extended coverage, while another 6 severely restrict coverage. The General Evaluation Office contacted the remaining 28 states and found that there was no extended coverage in 8 states; in 15 states, at least one plan provides such coverage; and in 5 states, all plans provide full coverage. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. \u2022 15 January 2021, Rhode Island is in the latter group, along with Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey and Vermont. In those five states, there is no choice for consumers who want a health plan that does not cover non-exempt abortions. In other words, the opening of the Catholic Rhode Island was accurate. The Affordable Care Act recognizes this issue and requires all states to provide an insurance option by 2017 that covers abortion only in cases of rape or incest or where the life of the mother is at risk. Questions were raised about abortion coverage prior to the establishment of a health exchange in Rhode Island. This exchange was established by Governor Shafi through an executive order in 2011, after efforts to do so were hampered through legislation in the General Assembly on abortion language. More recently, like last year, the State Senate approved a bill that required some plans to allow persons signing on their behalf to \"refuse\" abortion services. However, the bill did not exonerate the home and the Health Authority was established without any restrictions or government provisions relating to abortion. We now return to Raimundo &apos; s position on abortion insurance coverage. If the federal government will ultimately ask all health insurance exchanges, including Rhode Island, to present at least one plan that does not cover most abortions, how can Raimundo oppose them? When we asked this question to Raimundo's campaign, Nicole Kainer presented this statement: \"Jenna is not opposed to the health resource network, including an insurance plan that excludes reproductive services. In fact, the Affordable Care Act requires the exchange to do so by 2017. Individuals must be able to go to \"source health\" and buy a plan that makes more sense to them.\" Our ruling Catholic newspaper Rhode Island stated that Rhode Island was one of the few states that did not provide the insurance option that excluded most of the abortion coverage. According to a federal report, only Rhode Island and four other states fall into that category. We're ruling the statement right.
