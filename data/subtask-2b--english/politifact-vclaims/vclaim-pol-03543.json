Arnold Schwarzenegger won\u2019t be back to host The New Celebrity Apprentice. \nHe also\u00a0recently squashed rumors he might run for U.S. Senate.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that the bodybuilder-turned-movie-star-turned-politician plans to fade quietly into the Hollywood sunset.\u00a0\nSchwarzenegger\u2019s next adventure is tackling what he calls America\u2019s rigged political redistricting system.\n\"Gerrymandering has created an absurd reality where politicians now pick their voters instead of the voters picking their politicians,\" Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said in a recent video.\nHe cites reforms in California as a model for the nation: In 2008, voters in the state approved a bipartisan Citizens Redistricting Commission, which has been credited for drawing district boundaries in a way that\u2019s made some state and congressional races more competitive.\nSchwarzenegger made a claim on Twitter\u00a0and Facebook about just how lopsided congressional races have become nationwide:\n\n\"The average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%,\" he said on Twitter on Feb. 23, 2017, referring to the average percentage point victory for both Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election. \"There are dictators who win by less.\" \nGiven Schwarzenegger\u2019s new focus, we decided to see whether his claim about margin of victory in House races is correct -- or all pumped up. Our fact check focused on his 37 percent figure.\nOur research\nWe asked Schwarzenegger\u2019s spokesman for evidence. He cited a breakdown of the 2016 election on the website ballotpedia.org. It\u2019s an independent, online encyclopedia of American politics and elections.\nAnd, indeed, it lists the average margin of victory for members of the House at 37.1 percent. It notes that\u2019s up from the 35.8 percent margin in 2014.\nWe checked with one more knowledgeable source: Jack Pitney, a longtime professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College and former director of the Republican National Committee\u2019s Research Department.\nPitney crunched last year\u2019s election numbers for us and found a 39 percent margin of victory for House members. He said he wasn\u2019t sure what accounted for the slight difference in his findings.\n\"But the bottom line is that Arnold's point -- House members win by big margins -- is essentially correct,\" Pitney said.\nWhat accounts for that huge margin? Pitney said part of it is deliberate gerrymandering, and part is that \"constituencies are increasingly polarized.\"\n\"Even in states where you don\u2019t have a partisan (redistricting) process, Democrats tend to live in certain places. Republicans tend to live in others,\" the professor added.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of California\u2019s redistricting commission say it\u2019s created more competitive districts. As an example, some cite California's 49th Congressional District, where incumbent Republican Darrell Issa defeated Democrat Douglas Applegate by 0.5 percent of the vote -- the smallest margin of any House race in the nation.\nIssa, who\u2019s been in Congress since 2000, has won his district by 20 or even 30 percentage points in previous elections.\nBut as the Washington Post reported in December\u00a02016, the commission hasn\u2019t led to changes in party control in any of California\u2019s 53 congressional districts for several election cycles:\n\"For the fourth time in 12 years, not a single one of the state's 50-plus congressional districts switched parties. Just as in 2010, 2008 and 2004, every single seat returned to the party that previously controlled it,\" the Post reported on Dec. 1, 2016, adding that \"competitiveness has only ticked up slightly (in California\u2019s congressional districts) under the new map.\"\nWe asked Pitney how well the commission has performed:\n\"There\u2019s a debate about that,\" he told us. \"Some argue that what appeared to be a nonpartisan process was actually gamed by Democrats. Be that as it may, the real reason for Democratic dominance in congressional elections is there\u2019s just a lot more Democrats in California than there are Republicans. The state\u2019s been trending heavily Democratic for years.\"\nAbout those dictators\nSchwarzenegger also mentioned the electoral margins for dictators. That's not part of this fact-check but we thought it would be fun to check their margins, too.\nIn 2014, BBC News examined this topic in its article \"The world of 100% election victories.\" Here\u2019s what it found:\n-- North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un was elected in 2014 by the communist republic\u2019s parliament with 100% votes\n-- Former North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il fared almost as well as his son in 2009, winning 99.9 % of votes\n-- Former Iraq President Saddam Hussein also won 100% votes in a 2002 referendum\n-- Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro earned 99.4% votes in his 2008 election\n-- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad secured 97.6% votes for his 2007 presidential referendum.\nOur ruling\nFormer California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed the \u00a0\"average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%\" among Republicans and Democrats during last year\u2019s election.\nThat claim is supported by the 37.1 percent margin calculated by independent election tracker ballotpedia.org and longtime politics professor Jack Pitney of Claremont McKenna College, who put the margin slightly higher at 39 percent.\nThe evidence shows Schwarzenegger was on target with his claim.\nWe rated it True.\n\nTRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    1 7  Politifact Rating: True  \"The average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%\" for Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election.
