Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., that we rated Mostly False.\n(The Washington Post Fact Checker later gave Baldwin three Pinocchios for the claim.)\nBaldwin\u2019s claim\nBaldwin flatly stated that turnout in Wisconsin \"was reduced by approximately 200,000 votes because of\" the photo ID requirement.\nThe 2016 contest was the first presidential election in which the law was in effect. Baldwin cited a May 2017 report commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama. When we contacted a spokesman at the Democratic National Committee, asking for information to support Clinton\u2019s claim, he referred us to the same report.\nComparing the 2012 and 2016 elections, the report said that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad Wisconsin\u2019s photo ID law not been in effect, the report argues, Wisconsin\u2019s turnout would have been 200,000 votes higher, based on the average increase of 1.3 percent.\nExperts told us the methodology is lacking.\nPut simply: The voter ID requirement undoubtedly prevented or discouraged some individual people from voting. But the report attributes all of the lower turnout to the ID law, when there are many other reasons that could also explain it, including a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump, or perhaps a belief that Trump couldn\u2019t win Wisconsin.\nClinton\u2019s statement isn\u2019t as bold as Baldwin\u2019s, in that she refers to an estimate. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the methodology used to make that estimate, as we detailed in the Baldwin fact check, has been widely criticized.\nA final note from Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted that Trump earned almost the same number of votes in Wisconsin as did Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee.\n\"Clinton, in contrast, earned 238,000 fewer voters than did Obama,\" he said. \"It would be a mistake to attribute essentially all of that decline to the voter ID requirement.\"\nOur rating\nClinton said: \"The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote\" in the 2016 presidential election.\nA report three weeks earlier from a group that supports Democratic candidates says a decline in voter turnout between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections in Wisconsin was entirely due to the state\u2019s new photo identification requirement for voting.\n\nBut experts say that while photo ID requirements may reduce turnout to some extent, they question the methodology of the report and say there is no way to put a number on how many people in Wisconsin didn\u2019t vote because of the ID requirement.\nWe rate Clinton\u2019s statement Mostly False.
