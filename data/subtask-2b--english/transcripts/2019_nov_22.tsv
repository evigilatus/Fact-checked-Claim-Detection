1	Brian Kilmeade	We are joined right now.
2	Brian Kilmeade	It is our great pleasure to welcome the president, United States, Donald Trump, calling in.
3	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. Trump, good morning to you.
4	Donald Trump	Good morning.
5	Brian Kilmeade	Good to have you on Fox and Friends today.
6	Brian Kilmeade	[Laughs] As you said in your tweet, another slow news week.
7	Brian Kilmeade	Let's start with the fact that -- the story that Griff just brought us, that it sounds like a former FBI lawyer -- it sounds like -- was doing something with the FISA application.
8	Brian Kilmeade	That person got removed.
9	Brian Kilmeade	And this goes to your argument that somebody at the FBI was out to get you, right?
10	Donald Trump	Well, it certainly does.
11	Donald Trump	And they were spying on my campaign and it went right up to the top.
12	Donald Trump	And everybody knows it.
13	Donald Trump	And now we're going to find out.
14	Donald Trump	You have Bull Durham, who's supposed to be the toughest.
15	Donald Trump	I've never met him.
16	Donald Trump	Never spoke to him.
17	Donald Trump	But he's supposed to be the smartest and th­­e best.
18	Donald Trump	And he works for Bill Barr, who is a great attorney general.
19	Donald Trump	We would have maybe invented this thing a lot sooner had he been there originally.
20	Donald Trump	But you have some people that are great people, now, and -- patriotic people.
21	Donald Trump	They love our country.
22	Donald Trump	This was spying on my campaign, something that has never been done in the history of our country.
23	Donald Trump	This was an overthrow attempt at the presidency.
24	Donald Trump	They tried to overthrow the presidency.
25	Donald Trump	This is a disgrace.
26	Donald Trump	But what -- I'm not surprised to see; it's just starting to come out.
27	Donald Trump	I think this is nothing compared that what you'll see over the next couple of weeks.
28	Ainsley Earhardt	These media --
29	Donald Trump	These people are sick.
30	Ainsley Earhardt	These media outlets are saying that the FBI lawyer manipulated and altered key documents related to that warrant application so that they could get permission to surveil Carter Page.
31	Ainsley Earhardt	He was on with Maria -- Mornings with Maria -- a few minutes ago, and he says it's a cover up.
32	Ainsley Earhardt	Listen.
33	Carter Page	[Begin Video Clip] They have just been putting false information out there to the media, the Democrats and their allies in -- they're Washington -- in the media, constantly pushing lies after lies.
34	Carter Page	And then finally, this gets picked up by a court.
35	Carter Page	It gets picked up by the Comey-McCabe-FBI.
36	Carter Page	And they got a warrant, a fraudulent warrant, I believe, to spy on myself as a way of getting into the Trump campaign.
37	Maria Bartiromo	So, you --
38	Carter Page	There has been a continued cover up to this very day.
39	Carter Page	We still don't have the truth, but hopefully we'll get that soon.
40	Carter Page	[End Video Clip]
41	Ainsley Earhardt	How does this compare with what happened with that Ukraine conversation?
42	Ainsley Earhardt	Democrats want to impeach you because of that conversation, but this looks pretty bad.
43	Donald Trump	So my conversation was a perfect conversation.
44	Donald Trump	The Ukrainian president said, "What are they talking about?"
45	Donald Trump	There must think we're nuts in this country.
46	Donald Trump	And this conversation was flawless.
47	Donald Trump	It was appropriate.
48	Donald Trump	It was perfect.
49	Donald Trump	It was nice.
50	Donald Trump	It was everything.
51	Donald Trump	And they even said that.
52	Donald Trump	They came out and said it.
53	Donald Trump	Now, compare that -- as they try to impeach, and by the way, they've looked like fools over the last five days, as these interviews were -- these were their witnesses.
54	Donald Trump	This was the best they've got.
55	Donald Trump	Adam Schiff is a sick puppy.
56	Donald Trump	He is a -- it's pretty incredible.
57	Donald Trump	Now, what you're going to see, I predict, will be perhaps the biggest scandal in the history of our country, political scandal.
58	Donald Trump	But I guess that's the biggest, because what's more important than a political --?
59	Steve Doocy	What are you talking -- what do you mean by that?
60	Steve Doocy	What you mean by that?
61	Donald Trump	I think you're going to see things that are going to be incredible, if it's done right.
62	Donald Trump	And I purposely stay out.
63	Donald Trump	I tell Bill Barr to handle everything.
64	Donald Trump	I wouldn't have to, I could get very much involved, but I purposely don't.
65	Donald Trump	And I haven't.
66	Donald Trump	And you know what?
67	Donald Trump	It's better that way, I guess.
68	Donald Trump	I don't have any obligation, legally, to do that, but I've let them handle it.
69	Donald Trump	So you have a FISA report coming out, which the word is it's "historic."
70	Donald Trump	That's what the word is.
71	Donald Trump	That's what I hear.
72	Donald Trump	And if it's historic, you're going to see something.
73	Donald Trump	Then perhaps even more importantly, you have Durham coming out shortly thereafter.
74	Donald Trump	He's the U.S. attorney, and he's already announced it's criminal.
75	Donald Trump	And we'll see what happens.
76	Donald Trump	But --
77	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President.
78	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what.
79	Donald Trump	You have a lot of very, very bad people.
80	Donald Trump	And, you know, a lot of people say, "deep state."
81	Donald Trump	I don't like to use the word "deep state."
82	Donald Trump	So I just say they're really bad and sick people.
83	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President, you say it could be historic.
84	Brian Kilmeade	You have suggested in the past that this might go much higher than the Department of Justice, or the FBI during the Obama's administration.
85	Brian Kilmeade	Are you suggesting it could actually go up into the West Wing of the Obama --?
86	Donald Trump	You're dealing at the highest levels of government.
87	Donald Trump	They were spying on my campaign.
88	Donald Trump	This is my opinion.
89	Donald Trump	I said it a long time ago.
90	Donald Trump	Remember when I put out a tweet and I talked about the "wiretapping" in quotes, meaning modern day version of whatever wiretapping may be.
91	Donald Trump	And all hell broke loose.
92	Brian Kilmeade	Well, how high did it go, Mr. President.
93	Brian Kilmeade	How high did it go?
94	Brian Kilmeade	Your idea?
95	Donald Trump	Personally, I think it goes all the way.
96	Donald Trump	Okay?
97	Donald Trump	Because I think it's impossible --
98	Brian Kilmeade	To Barack Obama?
99	Brian Kilmeade	-- for Brennan and for Clapper and for all of these losers that you had over there.
100	Brian Kilmeade	I think it's impossible for them to be doing things.
101	Brian Kilmeade	And let's see what it all says.
102	Brian Kilmeade	But it's impossible -- Susan Rice, the person that worked at the United Nations who went after FISA reports and went after reports like she ate them for lunch.
103	Donald Trump	And, you know, you look at the previous administration that -- they went after like a few.
104	Donald Trump	And she was getting them by -- at a level nobody's ever even imagined before, and it had nothing to do with her.
105	Donald Trump	Now, I think this goes to the highest level.
106	Donald Trump	I hate to say it.
107	Donald Trump	I think it's a disgrace.
108	Donald Trump	They thought I was going to win, and they said, "How could we stop him?"
109	Donald Trump	They wrote up the phony fake dossier, the disgusting fake dossier, and they tried to have it put out prior to the election.
110	Donald Trump	And just to show how incompetent they were, they spent millions and millions of dollars.
111	Donald Trump	Hillary Clinton paid for it and the Democrats, a lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine.
112	Brian Kilmeade	But Mr. President --
113	Donald Trump	It's very interesting.
114	Donald Trump	It's very interesting.
115	Donald Trump	They have this server right, from the DNC Democratic National Committee.
116	Brian Kilmeade	Who has the server?
117	Donald Trump	The FBI went in and they told him, "Get out of here.
118	Donald Trump	You're not getting it.
119	Donald Trump	We're not giving it to you."
120	Donald Trump	They gave the server to Crowd Strike or whatever it's called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian.
121	Donald Trump	And I still want to see that server.
122	Donald Trump	You know, the FBI has never gotten that server.
123	Donald Trump	That's a big part of this whole thing.
124	Donald Trump	Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company?
125	Steve Doocy	Are you or they did that?
126	Steve Doocy	Are you sure they gave it to Ukraine?
127	Donald Trump	Well, that's what the word is.
128	Donald Trump	And that's what I asked actually in my phone call, you know.
129	Donald Trump	I mean, I asked that very point blank because we're looking for corruption.
130	Donald Trump	There's tremendous corruption we're looking for.
131	Donald Trump	Why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries where there's this kind of corruption?
132	Donald Trump	Right.
133	Donald Trump	If you look at my call, I said, you know, corruption -- I think he said it to me.
134	Donald Trump	He's looking.
135	Donald Trump	He got elected on the basis of corruption.
136	Donald Trump	And I also, by the way, going back to that, why isn't Germany putting up money?
137	Donald Trump	Why isn't France putting up money?
138	Donald Trump	Why isn't all of the European nations -- why are they putting up?
139	Donald Trump	You have the European Union and they're benefited in a lot more by --
140	Brian Kilmeade	Well, yeah.
141	Donald Trump	-- paying than we are.
142	Donald Trump	Well, Mr. President, can I ask you --
143	Donald Trump	It's like a massive wall?
144	Donald Trump	Yes.
145	Donald Trump	Why aren't they putting up money?
146	Donald Trump	How come it's always the United States that puts up money, the suckers?
147	Donald Trump	Why is it always the United States?
148	Donald Trump	And these are the questions I ask and continue to ask him.
149	Brian Kilmeade	True.
150	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President the best you can.
151	Brian Kilmeade	I know you've said that from day one about wiretapping.
152	Brian Kilmeade	And you felt as though the previous administration basically seems to have set you up to really struggle for the first three years.
153	Brian Kilmeade	Who is your source, or what are your sources that are telling you, that the Obama administration was out to really hurt your administration?
154	Donald Trump	Well, first of all, Brian, I haven't struggled because I've done more in the first two and a half years than any president in the history of our country.
155	Donald Trump	And almost everybody admits it.
156	Donald Trump	Between rebuilding our military, the biggest tax cut in history.
157	Brian Kilmeade	Okay.
158	Donald Trump	Regulation --
159	Brian Kilmeade	Would you say they've been in your way?
160	Brian Kilmeade	Would you say they've been in your way?
161	Donald Trump	Good.
162	Donald Trump	Well, wait a second.
163	Donald Trump	Two Supreme Court justices.
164	Donald Trump	Within a few weeks, we'll have one hundred and eighty-two federal judges.
165	Donald Trump	It's a record.
166	Donald Trump	So I've done more than anybody that ever had.
167	Brian Kilmeade	Understood.
168	Donald Trump	The position to [Inaudible] But they haven't made it pleasant.
169	Donald Trump	They're bad people.
170	Donald Trump	They hurt a lot of innocent people.
171	Donald Trump	People came down here, they got served subpoenas by Mueller and the crew.
172	Donald Trump	And they went through two and a half years.
173	Donald Trump	They found nothing.
174	Donald Trump	So why would you say that?
175	Donald Trump	I think we've had the most productive presidency ever for the first two and a half years.
176	Donald Trump	But it doesn't mean that it was pleasant.
177	Brian Kilmeade	I know, I know.
178	Brian Kilmeade	But maybe I should have been clearer.
179	Brian Kilmeade	My point is this.
180	Brian Kilmeade	I know you've had that point of view and some things are coming that direction to prove it.
181	Brian Kilmeade	But who is your source that's telling you this?
182	Donald Trump	I can't tell you that.
183	Donald Trump	I can only say that we have a lot of information that a lot of bad things happened.
184	Donald Trump	And when you look at Strzok and Page with the insurance policy, where, you know -- the two lovers, the two great lovers from the FBI.
185	Donald Trump	Where he's saying, "Oh, she's going to win 100 million to nothing, but just in case she loses, we have an insurance policy."
186	Donald Trump	Well, that means, you know, "We're going to take him down.
187	Donald Trump	We're going to take down the president."
188	Donald Trump	You wouldn't even believe this is possible.
189	Donald Trump	But the insurance policy is a very big find.
190	Donald Trump	Finding that text.
191	Donald Trump	And the only reason we found it was they didn't want to use their private servers for a very bad reason.
192	Donald Trump	Okay?
193	Donald Trump	So they use the public server.
194	Donald Trump	They use the FBI server.
195	Donald Trump	So here's the thing.
196	Donald Trump	We have so many -- regardless of what's coming out, okay?
197	Donald Trump	The information that we have now is beyond belief already.
198	Donald Trump	But what they have coming out, I hear, is historic.
199	Donald Trump	That's the way it was explained.
200	Donald Trump	I heard some stories.
201	Ainsley Earhardt	Coming out and -- All right, Mr. President --
202	Donald Trump	Of course the fake news will try and downplay it, but I don't think you can downplay this.
203	Brian Kilmeade	Not now.
204	Donald Trump	Fake news is part of it.
205	Donald Trump	You know, the Democrats and the fake news, they're one and the same.
206	Donald Trump	They will downplay it because I like -- I see these hearings where we have a great day.
207	Donald Trump	And then you pick up the phony New York Times, which is a total phony paper -- I don't read it anywhere, you can't read it.
208	Donald Trump	It's not even -- it has no relationship to the truth.
209	Donald Trump	And you read a story that took place, and they don't tell you what happened.
210	Donald Trump	They only put in the bad.
211	Donald Trump	They don't put in the good.
212	Donald Trump	Same thing with The Washington Post.
213	Donald Trump	It's a phony paper.
214	Donald Trump	We don't have it in the White House.
215	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President, so --
216	Donald Trump	And we saved a lot of money.
217	Ainsley Earhardt	-- when we're watching those closing arguments yesterday, Adam Schiff -- Democrats love it.
218	Ainsley Earhardt	You know, I'm sure he's getting pat on the back every time he walks down the halls in Washington, because people are saying, "Keep pushing, keep pushing.
219	Ainsley Earhardt	We want impeachment."
220	Ainsley Earhardt	But if you ask Republicans, and we're going to play a soundbite of his closing arguments, they say this is all theatrics.
221	Ainsley Earhardt	Watch this and we're going to get your reaction.
222	Donald Trump	Okay.
223	Adam Schiff	[Begin Video Clip] It came down to the fact that the day after Bob Mueller testified, the day after Bob Mueller testified, that Donald Trump invited Russian interference.
224	Adam Schiff	"Hey, Russia, if you're listening, come get Hillary's emails."
225	Adam Schiff	And later that day, they tried to hack her server.
226	Adam Schiff	The day after that, Donald Trump is back on the phone asking another nation to involve itself in another U.S. election.
227	Adam Schiff	That says to me, this president believes he is above the law, beyond accountability.
228	Adam Schiff	[End Video Clip]
229	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President was there quid pro quo, extortion, bribery?
230	Donald Trump	No, not at all.
231	Donald Trump	And let me tell you, he's a sick puppy.
232	Donald Trump	He's so sick.
233	Donald Trump	This guy is so -- I’ve been going through it for two and a half years about Russia.
234	Donald Trump	I've been tougher on Russia than any president in history.
235	Donald Trump	But for two and a half years, I've had to listen.
236	Donald Trump	This was their talking point, Trump and Russia.
237	Donald Trump	And if you take a look at it, just look at the facts.
238	Donald Trump	Even look at what I've done for Ukraine by giving them tank busters, by giving them stuff.
239	Donald Trump	And Obama would send pillows and sheets.
240	Donald Trump	He wouldn't send anything else.
241	Donald Trump	It's the whole thing.
242	Donald Trump	Now Schiff, remember this?
243	Donald Trump	He makes it all up.
244	Donald Trump	He's sick.
245	Donald Trump	There's something wrong with him.
246	Donald Trump	So he made up my phone call.
247	Donald Trump	He made it up.
248	Donald Trump	He made up a phone call.
249	Donald Trump	And then when I released it, everybody was embarrassed.
250	Donald Trump	And crazy Nancy Pelosi, who, by the way, is going to go down as the worst speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, she hasn't done anything.
251	Donald Trump	Well, she said she's like paralyzed.
252	Donald Trump	She cannot do anything.
253	Brian Kilmeade	And Mr. President --
254	Donald Trump	I predict she won't do USMCA, because Richard Trumka, who's a good guy, but a big union guy -- only cares about a union.
255	Donald Trump	Richard Trumka has her mortified.
256	Donald Trump	She won't do USMCA and everybody in the country wants it, the farmers, the manufacturers.
257	Donald Trump	But Richard Trumka has her -- like he plays her like a fiddle.
258	Donald Trump	And I predict you won't even do it.
259	Donald Trump	She -- and, by the way, she's got such pressure on her to do it.
260	Donald Trump	All she has to do is put it to a vote.
261	Donald Trump	She's holding it for six months.
262	Donald Trump	It's growing dust on her desk, and Mexico and Canada calling, saying, "What's going on?
263	Donald Trump	Where is our agreement?"
264	Donald Trump	They signed it.
265	Donald Trump	They're all set.
266	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President, a couple of days ago, your ambassador to the United -- to the E.U., Mr. Sondland, in his opening statement said that there was quid pro quo.
267	Brian Kilmeade	"There was quid pro quo," he said because you wanted an investigation into corruption, in exchange for a visit to the White House or something like that.
268	Donald Trump	Yeah, well, that's total nonsense.
269	Donald Trump	I do want -- always corruption.
270	Donald Trump	I say that to anybody.
271	Donald Trump	Why should we give money to a country that's known corrupt?
272	Donald Trump	It's a very corrupt country.
273	Donald Trump	I mean, I love the people in Ukraine.
274	Donald Trump	I know Ukrainian people.
275	Donald Trump	They're great people.
276	Donald Trump	But it's known as being the third most corrupt country in the world.
277	Donald Trump	Now, with this guy who, by the way, I hardly know him.
278	Donald Trump	Okay?
279	Brian Kilmeade	Sondland?
280	Donald Trump	Yeah.
281	Donald Trump	I've spoken to him a few times.
282	Donald Trump	How about the guy with the telephone?
283	Donald Trump	How about that one?
284	Donald Trump	I guarantee you that never took place.
285	Donald Trump	He said he's sitting there listening to me.
286	Donald Trump	I spoke so few times to him.
287	Donald Trump	But the guy yesterday on the telephone, David Holmes, "Yes, I heard the conversation."
288	Donald Trump	Well, I have really good hearing.
289	Donald Trump	And I've been watching guys for 40 years make phone calls.
290	Donald Trump	And I can't hear when -- you could be two feet away; I can't hear people making calls.
291	Donald Trump	I can't hear the other side, the phones up in the air.
292	Donald Trump	Unless you have it on the speaker phone, you can't do it.
293	Donald Trump	That was a total phony deal.
294	Donald Trump	That was a phone -- you know, again.
295	Donald Trump	Call it Deep State.
296	Donald Trump	Call it --
297	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President.
298	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President.
299	Donald Trump	Call it anti-Trump people.
300	Brian Kilmeade	Your ambassador said that there was quid pro quo because you wanted an investigation into corruption, but it involved Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.
301	Brian Kilmeade	And then it becomes like, look, "He's going after dirt on the Bidens because Joe Biden could be his opponent in 2020."
302	Donald Trump	Well, first of all, that's not true.
303	Donald Trump	Okay.
304	Donald Trump	Number one, it's absolutely not true.
305	Donald Trump	Now, then, you have to say, if you saw Joe Biden's --
306	Brian Kilmeade	Which part is not true?
307	Donald Trump	Joe Biden is corrupt.
308	Donald Trump	It's not true what he said.
309	Donald Trump	Now, what he said, also, is, "There was no quid pro quo.
310	Donald Trump	I want nothing."
311	Donald Trump	Remember was trending number one.
312	Donald Trump	"I want nothing."
313	Donald Trump	He said that when he was questioned.
314	Brian Kilmeade	He did.
315	Donald Trump	He, and by the way, check out his lawyers, they're Hillary Clinton lawyers.
316	Donald Trump	This guy has Hillary Clinton, the lawyers, their Democrats.
317	Brian Kilmeade	Sondland.
318	Donald Trump	But he's sitting there -- Sondland.
319	Donald Trump	Yes.
320	Donald Trump	He's sitting there with Clinton lawyers.
321	Donald Trump	They're passing him notes all the time.
322	Donald Trump	And he didn't put the most important phrase in his 22-page statement that he read.
323	Donald Trump	The most important phrase was, "I want nothing" -- twice I said it -- "I want nothing.
324	Donald Trump	I want nothing.
325	Donald Trump	I want no quid pro quo.
326	Donald Trump	Have President Zelensky do whatever is right."
327	Donald Trump	Something to that effect.
328	Donald Trump	And they didn't put that in.
329	Brian Kilmeade	[Inaudible]
330	Donald Trump	That was the end of him.
331	Donald Trump	I turned off the television.
332	Donald Trump	That's what he said.
333	Donald Trump	Now, with all of that, of course, you have to look at corruption.
334	Donald Trump	Are we going to be sending massive amounts of money to a country, and they're corrupt, and they steal the money, and it goes into everybody's bank accounts?
335	Donald Trump	So you have to look at that.
336	Donald Trump	And I will tell you this about Joe Biden.
337	Donald Trump	I never said it specifically on him.
338	Donald Trump	But I watched Joe Biden with the prosecutor, who a lot of people said was a great prosecutor, and they took him off.
339	Donald Trump	And he was prosecuting that company.
340	Donald Trump	And the kid who'd never made 10 cents in his life and all of a sudden is making millions of dollars a day, I mean, you tell me.
341	Donald Trump	This is a guy who got thrown out of the Navy dishonorably --
342	Brian Kilmeade	But --
343	Donald Trump	He gets thrown out of the Navy shortly thereafter and makes no money.
344	Donald Trump	Went through, made no money --
345	Brian Kilmeade	But Mr. President --
346	Donald Trump	And all of the sudden --
347	Brian Kilmeade	No, I hear you.
348	Donald Trump	-- becomes VP is making millions and millions of dollars, not only from there, but from China.
349	Donald Trump	[Crosstalk]
350	Donald Trump	So, Mr. President, the accusation is this, that you're using aid, taxpayer dollars, to attack a political opponent in Joe Biden.
351	Donald Trump	And you say, you do say, "I wanted to hold up that aid because of corruption," but you also have the phone calls --
352	Donald Trump	No, no.
353	Donald Trump	Two reasons.
354	Brian Kilmeade	Okay.
355	Donald Trump	For corruption because it's known.
356	Donald Trump	I want to make sure the money is going to be spent properly.
357	Donald Trump	But there's another reason that is maybe to me the most important.
358	Brian Kilmeade	Which is?
359	Donald Trump	Why isn't Germany, France, the European Union, why aren't all those countries in Europe, why aren't they paying?
360	Donald Trump	Why is it always the United States, the sucker?
361	Donald Trump	I got elected on that.
362	Brian Kilmeade	But they do give aid.
363	Donald Trump	They --
364	Brian Kilmeade	They do give aid.
365	Brian Kilmeade	We give more.
366	Brian Kilmeade	We always have.
367	Brian Kilmeade	But, Mr. President, you decide to say Rudy Giuliani, a longtime friend, mayor and prosecutor, you send him into the Ukraine.
368	Brian Kilmeade	I want you to hear with Ambassador Sondland said, and it's been pretty consistent among State Department workers.
369	Brian Kilmeade	It seems like Rudy Giuliani was getting under a lot of people's skin.
370	Brian Kilmeade	I want you to listen to what he said.
371	Donald Trump	Through the --
372	Brian Kilmeade	I want you here.
373	Brian Kilmeade	Listen.
374	Brian Kilmeade	I've known for a long time, too.
375	Brian Kilmeade	Let's listen.
376	Gordon Sondland	[Begin Video Clip] Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the president of the United States.
377	Gordon Sondland	We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani.
378	Gordon Sondland	We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine.
379	Gordon Sondland	[End Video Clip]
380	Brian Kilmeade	So why was it necessary to put Rudy in the middle of the Ukraine, a country he knew little about, as opposed to let the people do their jobs there and just give given the same mission?
381	Donald Trump	Okay.
382	Donald Trump	First of all, Volker, I don't know him.
383	Donald Trump	Don't know him.
384	Donald Trump	But this guy, Sondland, hardly know him.
385	Donald Trump	I've had a couple of conversations with him.
386	Donald Trump	I see him hanging around, you know, when I go to Europe.
387	Donald Trump	But he was really the European Union ambassador, and all of a sudden he's working on this, and, you know, ask about that.
388	Donald Trump	Rick Perry, I know very well.
389	Donald Trump	Frankly, I'd like Rick to make a statement, and Rick would make a statement.
390	Donald Trump	He's a great guy.
391	Donald Trump	I think he already made a statement.
392	Donald Trump	Great guy.
393	Donald Trump	Rudy is a great crime fighter.
394	Donald Trump	Rudy is the best mayor in the history of New York City.
395	Donald Trump	Rudy Giuliani is a very legendary figure in our country.
396	Donald Trump	Rudy was a U.S. attorney.
397	Donald Trump	He also worked at the Justice Department.
398	Donald Trump	Believe me, this kind of crap wouldn't have happened in the Justice Department if Rudy Giuliani was the attorney general, just like I believe Bill Barr will straighten it out and straighten it out for good.
399	Donald Trump	But Rudy Giuliani was one of the great crime fighters of all time.
400	Donald Trump	He's also a friend of mine.
401	Donald Trump	He's a great person.
402	Donald Trump	He's like an iconic figure in this country for two reasons.
403	Donald Trump	He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York, and he was the greatest crime fighter, probably, in the last 50 years.
404	Donald Trump	When you're dealing with a corrupt country, if Rudy Giuliani's -- he's got credentials because of his reputation.
405	Donald Trump	When Rudy Giuliani goes there, and you hear it's a corrupt country, I mean, it means a lot.
406	Donald Trump	It's mean a lot.
407	Donald Trump	But two of his sources are indicted on -- are right now in jail.
408	Donald Trump	Those are two of his sources, and one of his other sources is looked at as a corrupt figure.
409	Donald Trump	So in the end, it seems like you had this.
410	Donald Trump	You had State Department and Rudy Giuliani working against each other.
411	Donald Trump	And then the accusation comes in that your ambassador is being tarnished by Rudy Giuliani.
412	Donald Trump	Look, the ambassador, the woman, she wouldn't even put up -- she's an Obama person, you know.
413	Donald Trump	But I said, "Why are you being so kind?"
414	Donald Trump	"Well, sir, she's a woman.
415	Donald Trump	We have to be nice."
416	Donald Trump	She's very tough.
417	Donald Trump	I've heard bad things.
418	Donald Trump	And by the way, when I was talking to President Zelensky, it's right on the phone.
419	Donald Trump	You can read it.
420	Donald Trump	He didn't like her.
421	Donald Trump	He brought up her name, and he didn't like her at all.
422	Donald Trump	How do you have an ambassador when the president, the new president, does not?
423	Donald Trump	Because she was so wedded in.
424	Donald Trump	And don't forget, Ukraine hated me.
425	Donald Trump	They were after me in the election.
426	Donald Trump	They wanted Hillary Clinton to win.
427	Donald Trump	And when I won, all of a sudden they became so nice.
428	Donald Trump	They were doing -- they had to make up -- there many articles where they had to, you know, get to be friendly, you know, because we're like a gravy train for them, okay?
429	Donald Trump	We're like their gravy train.
430	Donald Trump	So they were totally in favor of Hillary Clinton.
431	Donald Trump	But this ambassador that, you know, everybody says is so wonderful?
432	Donald Trump	She wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy.
433	Donald Trump	Okay?
434	Donald Trump	She's in charge of the embassy.
435	Donald Trump	She wouldn't hang it.
436	Donald Trump	It took like a year and a half or two years for her to get the picture up.
437	Donald Trump	She said bad things about me.
438	Donald Trump	She wouldn't defend me.
439	Donald Trump	And I have the right to change an Ambassador.
440	Donald Trump	And Rudy didn't say good things, but he wasn't crazy about it.
441	Donald Trump	You know, it wasn't like a major topic.
442	Donald Trump	But I have the right to change.
443	Donald Trump	This was an Obama person -- didn't want to hang my picture in the embassy.
444	Donald Trump	Standard is you put the president of the United States pictured at an embassy.
445	Donald Trump	This was not an angel, this woman, okay?
446	Donald Trump	And there are a lot of things that she did that I didn't like.
447	Donald Trump	And we will talk about that at some time.
448	Donald Trump	But I just want to let you know, this was not a baby that we're dealing with.
449	Ainsley Earhardt	There was one woman who was in all of these testimonies this week who was sticking up for you, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.
450	Ainsley Earhardt	She was asking questions, doing her job.
451	Ainsley Earhardt	She said her constituents want to get to the bottom of what happened with the Bidens and that investigation.
452	Ainsley Earhardt	She questioned Tim Morrison and Kurt Volker on Capitol Hill.
453	Ainsley Earhardt	Listen to this.
454	Donald Trump	Okay.
455	Elise Stefanik	[Begin Video Clip] But the truth is, the facts are indeed not complicated.
456	Elise Stefanik	And I'm going to close out with two questions for the both of you.
457	Elise Stefanik	Did Ukraine open investigation into the Biden's?
458	Elise Stefanik	Mr. Morrison.
459	Tim Morrison	Not to my knowledge, ma'am.
460	Elise Stefanik	Ambassador Volker.
461	Kurt Volker	Not to my knowledge, either.
462	Elise Stefanik	Did either of you ever have any evidence of quid pro quo?
463	Elise Stefanik	Mr. Morrison.
464	Tim Morrison	No, ma'am.
465	Elise Stefanik	Ambassador Volker.
466	Kurt Volker	I did not.
467	Elise Stefanik	Any evidence of bribery?
468	Tim Morrison	No, ma'am.
469	Kurt Volker	No, ma'am.
470	Kurt Volker	[End Video Clip]
471	Ainsley Earhardt	She's been racked over the coals for that.
472	Ainsley Earhardt	Kellyanne Conway's husband was one of the ones that called her trash.
473	Donald Trump	So I'll tell you, first of all, she's become a star.
474	Donald Trump	You know, every time you do something, you have guys like Jim Jordan and Meadows, or all these guys, they've been around and they're stars, but they've been stars.
475	Donald Trump	Every once in a while you meet a new star.
476	Donald Trump	I know a lot about stardom.
477	Donald Trump	I know a lot about it.
478	Donald Trump	I've made plenty of them.
479	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what, this young woman from upstate New York, she has become a star.
480	Donald Trump	Her way -- you know, you can never define exactly what it is.
481	Donald Trump	You understand that you're a star.
482	Donald Trump	Okay?
483	Donald Trump	Why?
484	Donald Trump	Who the hell knows?
485	Donald Trump	But you're a star.
486	Donald Trump	There aren't many of them.
487	Donald Trump	But what happens is she has become a star.
488	Donald Trump	Her mannerism, her way of talking, her --
489	Brian Kilmeade	She's direct.
490	Brian Kilmeade	Right to the point.
491	Donald Trump	No.
492	Donald Trump	It's just the whole thing.
493	Donald Trump	It just works.
494	Donald Trump	She's a tremendous person.
495	Donald Trump	She was fantastic during the hearings.
496	Donald Trump	Turner, every -- so many people there were so great.
497	Donald Trump	But you know what?
498	Donald Trump	The bottom line is all of those witnesses, they're all shifty Schiff, don't forget.
499	Donald Trump	There was no due process.
500	Donald Trump	You can't have lawyers.
501	Donald Trump	We couldn't have any witnesses.
502	Donald Trump	We want to call the whistleblower.
503	Donald Trump	But, you know, who I want as the first witness?
504	Donald Trump	Because, frankly, I want a trial.
505	Donald Trump	You know, I could -- think I can have it.
506	Brian Kilmeade	You want to a trial?
507	Donald Trump	Oh, I would look -- number one.
508	Donald Trump	They should never, ever impeach.
509	Donald Trump	This is not envy.
510	Donald Trump	I watched five people on your network yesterday say there's nothing here.
511	Donald Trump	Andy McCarthy.
512	Donald Trump	How about Kent and the special prosecutor?
513	Brian Kilmeade	Ken Starr?
514	Donald Trump	And special counsel, Ken Starr?
515	Donald Trump	He was fantastic.
516	Donald Trump	He said, "There's nothing here."
517	Donald Trump	So ready?
518	Donald Trump	Number one, there should never be an impeachment.
519	Donald Trump	This is not an impeachment.
520	Donald Trump	That phone call was totally appropriate.
521	Donald Trump	Okay.
522	Donald Trump	Totally.
523	Donald Trump	But assuming these people are as sleazy as they are, and Nancy Pelosi is totally incompetent, she's lost absolutely lost -- she doesn't know what she's doing.
524	Donald Trump	She hasn't done anything.
525	Donald Trump	She can't get anything approved.
526	Donald Trump	Everybody's working on this, and they just got blown away because they put their witnesses up.
527	Donald Trump	And we're not going to get USMCA --
528	Brian Kilmeade	So you want a trial?
529	Donald Trump	-- farmers and everyone is going to vote against Democrats like you've never seen before.
530	Donald Trump	But if they do put it up, because they're crazy, I mean, Adam Schiff is a nut job.
531	Donald Trump	Listen to this.
532	Donald Trump	Adam Schiff gets up before Congress and he made up my statement.
533	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
534	Donald Trump	And I said, "Who made that statement?
535	Donald Trump	".
536	Brian Kilmeade	Right, Mr. President?
537	Donald Trump	He made it up.
538	Donald Trump	And then after he got caught three days later, he started saying parody.
539	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President?
540	Donald Trump	The thing I did that was right, Brian, the thing I did that was right was I released the transcript of the call immediately.
541	Donald Trump	Had I not done that; I would have had a big problem.
542	Donald Trump	A big problem because they all lied about my call.
543	Donald Trump	My call was perfect.
544	Donald Trump	If you heard Adam Schiff's made up version of my call, I mean, it was the worst thing I've ever heard.
545	Donald Trump	I said, "How could that be possible?"
546	Donald Trump	And you know the sad part?
547	Donald Trump	Because he made it in the halls of Congress, he has immunity.
548	Donald Trump	I can't sue him.
549	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
550	Donald Trump	The Republican Party can't sue him.
551	Donald Trump	Now, one other thing before we get off the Republican Party --
552	Brian Kilmeade	[Inaudible]
553	Donald Trump	I know.
554	Donald Trump	We can keep this going all day, right?
555	Donald Trump	It's easy.
556	Donald Trump	But look, the Republican Party has never been more unified.
557	Donald Trump	Both the Senate and the House.
558	Donald Trump	Mitch, Lindsey, I could name 20 names up there.
559	Donald Trump	I could -- they have never had -- look, we won 196 to nothing.
560	Donald Trump	That never happens.
561	Donald Trump	You know, I always say the Democrats are lousy politicians to have lousy policy, but they stick together, and they're vicious.
562	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
563	Brian Kilmeade	Well --
564	Donald Trump	They're more vicious, frankly.
565	Donald Trump	But the Republicans, they have a tendency -- they break up.
566	Donald Trump	They don't -- the Republicans, I have never seen anything like --
567	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President.
568	Donald Trump	They're sticking together.
569	Brian Kilmeade	We understand that there were six Republican senators -- this is perfect transition into this question -- who talked to you yesterday --
570	Donald Trump	Yeah.
571	Brian Kilmeade	-- along with the White House lawyer.
572	Brian Kilmeade	I know Jared Kushner was there.
573	Brian Kilmeade	You're trying to figure out some sort of strategy going forward because --
574	Donald Trump	Yeah.
575	Brian Kilmeade	-- it does look as if Nancy Pelosi, you know, her back is up against the wall.
576	Brian Kilmeade	She's going to have to go ahead and proceed with the impeachment vote.
577	Brian Kilmeade	It's going to wind up in the Senate.
578	Brian Kilmeade	And you say that you -- to your earlier point -- you want a full trial because then you will wind up with, according to this story, due process, which you feel you did not get with Adam Schiff.
579	Brian Kilmeade	Which means you can call your own witnesses, and you would love to see Hunter Biden in the chair to answer all those questions about Ukraine.
580	Donald Trump	Well, there's only one person I want more than where's Hunter?
581	Donald Trump	And that is Adam Schiff.
582	Donald Trump	I want to put that guy with his, with his way.
583	Donald Trump	I want…
584	Brian Kilmeade	What's your first question for Adam Schiff?
585	Donald Trump	I almost said something that might have been slightly controversial.
586	Steve Doocy	Yes.
587	Donald Trump	But I didn't.
588	Donald Trump	I'm learning.
589	Donald Trump	See that Steve?
590	Donald Trump	I'm learning.
591	Donald Trump	But after all these years, I finally learned.
592	Donald Trump	But look, I want to see Adam Schiff testify about the whistleblower who is a fake whistleblower, because the whistleblower report was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine.
593	Donald Trump	It bored no relationship.
594	Donald Trump	It said there were eight, seven or eight, quid pro quos.
595	Donald Trump	That were none.
596	Donald Trump	It bore no relationship to my call.
597	Donald Trump	Nobody brings that out.
598	Donald Trump	The whistle blower is, in my opinion, a political operative, just like his lawyer, who is one of the worst people in Washington.
599	Steve Doocy	Do you think you know who it is?
600	Donald Trump	I know exactly who it is.
601	Donald Trump	Everybody does.
602	Steve Doocy	Is he still there?
603	Steve Doocy	Does he go to meetings --
604	Donald Trump	Everybody does --
605	Steve Doocy	-- does he go to meetings?
606	Donald Trump	And by the way, you know who the whistleblower is, too.
607	Donald Trump	Otherwise, you're not doing your job.
608	Donald Trump	You know the -- everybody knows it.
609	Donald Trump	If the whistleblower were on the other side, they would have revealed the whistleblower two months ago.
610	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President.
611	Donald Trump	But the Democrats and their machine, the media machine, the fake, corrupt media, they protect.
612	Donald Trump	But you know who the whistleblower is.
613	Donald Trump	So do I. I know it.
614	Donald Trump	But I want the whistleblower who put in a false report to testify.
615	Donald Trump	I want to know, why did the IG put in the report?
616	Donald Trump	You have an IG, right?
617	Donald Trump	Why did the IG instead of saying, "Let me take the report.
618	Donald Trump	Let me now go to the White House.
619	Donald Trump	Ask the president to declassify his conversation so that it has to match up."
620	Donald Trump	He didn't do that.
621	Donald Trump	So what you do is you have a whistleblower with a fake story, just like -- it's just as fake as Schiff's story.
622	Donald Trump	That's why a lot of people think that Schiff basically is, essentially, the whistleblower.
623	Donald Trump	He already told the whistle blower what to do.
624	Donald Trump	I mean, his whole story is that he doesn't know the whistleblower.
625	Donald Trump	If he doesn't, then he's the only person in Washington that doesn't.
626	Donald Trump	And it's already been acknowledged that his staff met with the whistleblower.
627	Donald Trump	Okay, it is probably more than --
628	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
629	Brian Kilmeade	Go ahead.
630	Donald Trump	Who I what to testify most is shifty Schiff.
631	Donald Trump	And I want to find out, why did he make up my statement?
632	Donald Trump	He made up my statement, and I want to find that out.
633	Donald Trump	Why did shifty Schiff, who's a crooked politician, he's a corrupt politician, why did he make up my statement?
634	Donald Trump	He made up a statement.
635	Donald Trump	And I'm listen to it --
636	Ainsley Earhardt	Because they didn't think you were going to release the transcript.
637	Donald Trump	No, no, he -- that's right.
638	Donald Trump	Exactly.
639	Donald Trump	Because where this whole thing fell apart and where, frankly, the Republicans became so incredibly unified is after they read my statement --
640	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
641	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President.
642	Donald Trump	-- every one of them said -- and only the ones that are a little off on my statement are the people, that haven't quite read it yet.
643	Donald Trump	To say, "Well, this isn't an impeachable -- [Crosstalk]
644	Ainsley Earhardt	Well, if you read it, Democrats are going to say it was quid pro quo.
645	Ainsley Earhardt	If you are a conservative, you're going to say --
646	Donald Trump	No.
647	Donald Trump	They can't.
648	Donald Trump	They can't.
649	Ainsley Earhardt	Well, they're saying that it was.
650	Ainsley Earhardt	They believe in a roundabout way that it was.
651	Ainsley Earhardt	[Crosstalk]
652	Donald Trump	Well, Adam Schiff says what I said, too, and it was totally different.
653	Ainsley Earhardt	But the bottom line is, is this an impeachable offense?
654	Ainsley Earhardt	Did you do anything that they can impeach you for?
655	Donald Trump	There's nothing there.
656	Donald Trump	In fact, they asked these terrible witnesses yesterday.
657	Donald Trump	Again, I don't even know these people.
658	Donald Trump	You know, I come to Washington.
659	Donald Trump	So you've had Bush and you have never-Trumpers.
660	Donald Trump	So you have Bush.
661	Donald Trump	You have Clinton.
662	Donald Trump	You have Obama.
663	Donald Trump	So you have 24 years of people in positions, right?
664	Donald Trump	Then I come in with no experience, which is a good thing.
665	Donald Trump	But I know life, and I come in, and I end up with thousands of people that are never-Trumpers, Clinton's people, and sometimes the never-Trumpers are worse than Clinton and Obama people, believe me.
666	Donald Trump	You know, I mean, it's an amazing phenomena.
667	Brian Kilmeade	But that's one thing -- President Obama released every --
668	Donald Trump	Okay, Brian?
669	Brian Kilmeade	Yes?
670	Donald Trump	Well, listen to this for a second.
671	Donald Trump	With no experience at doing this -- but I've had a lot of experience in life.
672	Donald Trump	And we're doing great as a country and we’re respected again as a country, we were not respected -- with no experience, I come to Washington.
673	Donald Trump	I've defeated the Clinton dynasty.
674	Donald Trump	I've defeated the Bush dynasty, and I've defeated the Obama whatever you want to call it.
675	Donald Trump	Right?
676	Donald Trump	The three biggest.
677	Donald Trump	I've defeated them all at one time with no experience.
678	Donald Trump	The hatred is incredible.
679	Donald Trump	But I have to deal with crazy Nancy.
680	Donald Trump	I mean, she's crazy as a bedbug.
681	Donald Trump	She is nuts.
682	Donald Trump	And what she's doing -- and she's not talented.
683	Donald Trump	She's highly overrated -- all she's doing is sitting.
684	Donald Trump	She's not doing any work for the people.
685	Donald Trump	And now it turns out that the whole impeachment thing is a scam.
686	Brian Kilmeade	Okay.
687	Brian Kilmeade	Gotcha.
688	Brian Kilmeade	So --
689	Donald Trump	And now on top of it, now you're starting to get some feedback that the IG report is coming out.
690	Donald Trump	And I think that will be --
691	Brian Kilmeade	Explosive.
692	Donald Trump	-- the greatest political scandal in the history of our country.
693	Brian Kilmeade	If we could -- now let's switch.
694	Brian Kilmeade	And let's talk a little bit about 2020.
695	Steve Doocy	Well, I'd like -- well, let me just interrupt for a second.
696	Steve Doocy	Mr. President, you said we know the name of the whistleblower.
697	Steve Doocy	We've seen names on the Internet.
698	Steve Doocy	We have no idea who the whistleblower is.
699	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
700	Donald Trump	No.
701	Donald Trump	I don't believe it.
702	Donald Trump	Steve, can I tell you -- [Crosstalk]
703	Steve Doocy	But it's -- all right.
704	Donald Trump	I don't think Steve has ever told a lie, Ainsley and Brian, in his life.
705	Donald Trump	But that one I'm sort of thinking.
706	Donald Trump	All right.
707	Donald Trump	Come on.
708	Brian Kilmeade	So you expect to --
709	Donald Trump	And I'm always telling people I watch your show in the morning.
710	Donald Trump	I don't watch the garbage.
711	Donald Trump	The other garbage.
712	Steve Doocy	We've seen names online, Mr. President.
713	Steve Doocy	But we don't have any verification.
714	Brian Kilmeade	Yeah, and it doesn't matter.
715	Brian Kilmeade	It doesn't matter anyway.
716	Brian Kilmeade	We're not going to use it.
717	Donald Trump	You don't need verification.
718	Donald Trump	You know exactly who it is.
719	Donald Trump	But I like that you say that.
720	Brian Kilmeade	So, Mr. President, you expect an impeachment vote, you expect to get impeached and would you say you said you embrace the idea --
721	Donald Trump	No, I don't expect it.
722	Brian Kilmeade	You don't expect it?
723	Brian Kilmeade	You don't expect Democrats are going to vote for this?
724	Donald Trump	I think it's very hard for them to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing.
725	Donald Trump	No, I would expect that -- okay.
726	Donald Trump	Ready?
727	Donald Trump	You've seen the polls over the last week.
728	Donald Trump	I'm going through the roof.
729	Donald Trump	In Wisconsin, I'm way up over every Democrat.
730	Brian Kilmeade	You are.
731	Donald Trump	The swing states, which is the important one.
732	Donald Trump	You know, you have two elections.
733	Donald Trump	You have Electoral College, you have popularity.
734	Donald Trump	I like to go for the Electoral College.
735	Donald Trump	By the way, for me to win the popular vote would be much easier than -- the Electoral College is much harder to win.
736	Donald Trump	Much harder.
737	Donald Trump	You have to go to many more places, etc., etc.
738	Donald Trump	But if you look at the swing states, I'm way up at every one of them because of the impeachment thing.
739	Donald Trump	And it's crazy what's going on.
740	Donald Trump	Because the people get it.
741	Donald Trump	It's a hoax.
742	Donald Trump	This is a continuation of the witch hunt which has gone on from before I got elected.
743	Ainsley Earhardt	Well --
744	Donald Trump	If you look at the -- you know, we talked about the insurance policy.
745	Donald Trump	Right.
746	Donald Trump	You know, "We've got an insurance policy just in case she loses."
747	Donald Trump	Right?
748	Donald Trump	This was a text between the two great lovers.
749	Donald Trump	If you look at that, that was long before the election took place.
750	Donald Trump	So this was taking, you know, route -- with Comey, who's a totally disgusting human being -- by the way, and if I didn't fire Comey, I would have been in some trouble right now.
751	Brian Kilmeade	And maybe you should have done it right away.
752	Brian Kilmeade	But Mr. President --
753	Donald Trump	All coming after me, and I wouldn't have known that he was a phony that Strzok and Page in all of these people.
754	Donald Trump	McCabe.
755	Donald Trump	The whole gang of them.
756	Donald Trump	We wouldn't have been able to find it out.
757	Donald Trump	Turned out to be the best move I've ever made, firing Comey.
758	Donald Trump	Because they were looking to take down the president of the United States.
759	Brian Kilmeade	He doesn't agree.
760	Brian Kilmeade	John Bolton has just gone back on Twitter.
761	Brian Kilmeade	His account was frozen for two months.
762	Brian Kilmeade	Did you guys freeze his account?
763	Donald Trump	No, of course not.
764	Donald Trump	Of course not.
765	Donald Trump	No, I actually had a good relationship with John.
766	Donald Trump	We disagreed on some things and some methods, but I actually had a good relationship.
767	Ainsley Earhardt	All right, Mr. President.
768	Ainsley Earhardt	Let's talk about --
769	Donald Trump	I didn't hear about that.
770	Ainsley Earhardt	Let's talk about 2020, because we saw the last Democratic debate, and the ratings were really low.
771	Ainsley Earhardt	I don't know if that's an indication that it's too early or if people are not interested in these candidates.
772	Ainsley Earhardt	And maybe that's why some of these other guys are talking about jumping into the race.
773	Ainsley Earhardt	Elizabeth Warren says she's going to use tax dollars to take down your border wall.
774	Ainsley Earhardt	Listen to this.
775	Unidentified	[Begin Video Clip] Would you ask taxpayers to pay to take down any part of the wall on the nation's southern border?
776	Elizabeth Warren	If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course, we should do it.
777	Elizabeth Warren	The real point here is that we need to stop this manmade crisis at the border.
778	Elizabeth Warren	Trump is the one who has created this crisis.
779	Elizabeth Warren	[End Video Clip]
780	Ainsley Earhardt	Tom Honan said the reason that the numbers are down is because of the wall.
781	Ainsley Earhardt	What do you say?
782	Donald Trump	Absolutely.
783	Donald Trump	We've built almost 100 miles of wall.
784	Donald Trump	It's going up fast.
785	Donald Trump	Army Corps of Engineers is doing it.
786	Donald Trump	We have the funding.
787	Donald Trump	I took it out of the military.
788	Donald Trump	You know, I've rebuilt the military.
789	Donald Trump	That's another thing we've done, which was, when I took it over -- and we defeated ISIS.
790	Donald Trump	We took the caliphate.
791	Donald Trump	We just took out al-Baghdadi.
792	Donald Trump	I got you know; I don't want it.
793	Donald Trump	I don't want it, frankly.
794	Donald Trump	But if Obama did al-Baghdadi, the biggest terrorist the last hundred year, if Obama did it, it would be a two-year story.
795	Donald Trump	With me, I got a day.
796	Donald Trump	Not that it matters, but it was a tremendous thing.
797	Donald Trump	We defeated him.
798	Donald Trump	But let me just tell you about the wall.
799	Donald Trump	Without the wall -- and Tom Homan's a great guy -- without the wall, it would be a disaster.
800	Brian Kilmeade	Absolutely.
801	Donald Trump	So and if she took down the wall -- you need the wall.
802	Donald Trump	You know, they want to have drones flying around up and down, and, you know, this and that.
803	Donald Trump	It's all just a waste of money.
804	Donald Trump	Other than -- we have drones flying to see if anybody is trying to break through the wall.
805	Donald Trump	Because if you have a bulldozer or if you have heavy blow torches and things, you know, you can break through.
806	Donald Trump	We have -- the wall is electrified, so that if anyone touches it, we know exactly what's happening.
807	Donald Trump	We can get there within minutes.
808	Steve Doocy	Sure.
809	Steve Doocy	You were elected to -- [Crosstalk]
810	Donald Trump	Now, we're building a fantastic wall, and without the wall now -- it just means she's going to lose.
811	Donald Trump	Because one of the issues that I won on last time was border security.
812	Donald Trump	And you see where the numbers are.
813	Donald Trump	Now, until I got the wall built, I got Mexico -- because we're not allowed -- very simply, we have loopholes.
814	Donald Trump	And they call loopholes for a reason, because there are loopholes.
815	Donald Trump	I could end those loopholes in 15 minutes with crazy Nancy Pelosi and Schumer.
816	Donald Trump	I could end them in 15 minutes.
817	Donald Trump	But they don't want to meet about them because they like trouble, because the more trouble we have -- they don't care about the country.
818	Donald Trump	The more trouble they have, the better it is for them, they think the worse it is for me.
819	Donald Trump	So I got the war built despite them fighting me.
820	Donald Trump	I got so much money for them, for the military.
821	Donald Trump	It's the one thing that wouldn't give you money for the wall because they thought that was a very good thing politically.
822	Donald Trump	If you don't have a wall, we don't have a country.
823	Donald Trump	If we don't have a border, we don't have a country.
824	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President, right now.
825	Brian Kilmeade	Elizabeth Warren wants to take it down.
826	Brian Kilmeade	Who do you think right now is likely to be your opponent?
827	Brian Kilmeade	Mayor Pete is evidently moving up in the early states.
828	Brian Kilmeade	Joe Biden wins most national polls.
829	Brian Kilmeade	Elizabeth Warren is still among the leaders.
830	Brian Kilmeade	Who do you think it's going to be?
831	Donald Trump	Well, I don't know if Joe can make it.
832	Donald Trump	Mentally, he's off.
833	Donald Trump	There's no question about it.
834	Donald Trump	So I don't know if he's going to make it mentally.
835	Donald Trump	If he can get through it, you know, without cracking up, which is a real question.
836	Donald Trump	I mean, many people asked that.
837	Donald Trump	Maybe him.
838	Donald Trump	You know, don't forget, people have seen his name for a long time.
839	Donald Trump	But Pete is you know, I call him Alfred E. Neuman, to me, reminds me of Mad magazine, Alfred E. Neuman.
840	Donald Trump	And I don't see him.
841	Donald Trump	I don't see him dealing with President Xi.
842	Donald Trump	I don't see him dealing with Kim Jong Un.
843	Donald Trump	I just don't see it.
844	Donald Trump	But maybe he is.
845	Donald Trump	I mean, look, I wouldn't mind running against any of them.
846	Donald Trump	So I would say maybe Biden has the advantage.
847	Donald Trump	I think Pocahontas has come up from the embers.
848	Donald Trump	I thought I, I mean, I hit her too early.
849	Donald Trump	I came up with this name that seems to have stuck very nicely..
850	Brian Kilmeade	Bloomberg?
851	Donald Trump	But they don't use it.
852	Donald Trump	I don't see him.
853	Donald Trump	I know him pretty well.
854	Donald Trump	He finished very weak in New York.
855	Donald Trump	He starts with, you know, telling you what you can drink, what you can do, what you -- no, I don't see it.
856	Donald Trump	He's desperately -- I'm sure he's going to run.
857	Donald Trump	He is going to spend.
858	Donald Trump	He's got the money just to put on a great campaign.
859	Donald Trump	I don't see it.
860	Donald Trump	His time has come and gone.
861	Steve Doocy	It would be hard to believe a New York real estate developer, or a billionaire could ever be president.
862	Steve Doocy	Mr. President.
863	Steve Doocy	Just kidding.
864	Steve Doocy	You know, the stock market hit another record this past week.
865	Steve Doocy	Clearly, that is your strong suit going into the 2020, because, you know, you look at the polls.
866	Steve Doocy	People feel better about their money situation right now.
867	Donald Trump	Right.
868	Steve Doocy	Going forward toward November of next year, how are you going to make sure everybody understands what you have been able to do over the last, then, four years?
869	Donald Trump	By talking to you, it's all good to do.
870	Steve Doocy	Good.
871	Donald Trump	Everyone's listening right down.
872	Donald Trump	Nobody's listening to any other show.
873	Donald Trump	But look, strong suit.
874	Donald Trump	My strong suit is I rebuilt a military.
875	Donald Trump	The vets -- for years, you would turn on your television.
876	Donald Trump	Every night, you'd see a story about the vets and how badly they're being treated, and it's a horror show.
877	Donald Trump	You don't hear that anymore.
878	Donald Trump	I got veterans choice.
879	Donald Trump	I got to -- that means they can go see a doctor if they have to wait online.
880	Donald Trump	If they go see a doctor, we pay the bill.
881	Donald Trump	It's unbelievable what happened.
882	Donald Trump	I have veterans accountability.
883	Donald Trump	You couldn't fire -- for 50 years, they've been trying to get -- you couldn't fire because there were unions and civil service.
884	Donald Trump	So if you had somebody beating up vets, stealing from the V.A., you couldn't fire them for any reason for it.
885	Brian Kilmeade	Certainly something to run on.
886	Brian Kilmeade	And they are appreciative it.
887	Brian Kilmeade	On the economy --
888	Donald Trump	I got that --
889	Brian Kilmeade	President Xi --
890	Donald Trump	But listen.
891	Donald Trump	Rebuilding the military.
892	Donald Trump	All of the things I've done.
893	Donald Trump	Plus, we've had peace.
894	Donald Trump	You know, we're pulling way down in Afghanistan.
895	Donald Trump	We're working on an agreement now with the Taliban.
896	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.
897	Donald Trump	The last time I was close to have an agreement, then they thought when they came over, they thought it would be good to kill people so they could, you know, negotiate from a position of strength.
898	Donald Trump	They killed 12 people in order to show they are tough guys, and I canceled the meeting.
899	Donald Trump	I said, "That's not what we're dealing with."
900	Donald Trump	Anyway.
901	Donald Trump	We're pulling back.
902	Donald Trump	I just pulled out of Syria; except I kept the oil.
903	Donald Trump	If it was okay with you.
904	Brian Kilmeade	We 600 hundred guys there.
905	Brian Kilmeade	Right?
906	Donald Trump	I want to -- okay.
907	Brian Kilmeade	President Xi has just said this.
908	Brian Kilmeade	"We want to work for a Phase 1 agreement on the basis of mutual respect and equality with the United States."
909	Brian Kilmeade	Where are you at?
910	Brian Kilmeade	You were kind of down on a deal and the market kind of dipped on this.
911	Brian Kilmeade	Where do you stand right now with the trade deal with China?
912	Donald Trump	Very good.
913	Donald Trump	We have a deal, potentially, very close.
914	Donald Trump	He wants to make it much more than I want to make it.
915	Donald Trump	I'm not anxious to make it.
916	Donald Trump	We're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.
917	Donald Trump	We never took in 10 cents.
918	Donald Trump	We are not paying like, you know, they fed the line, you know -- the media fed the line about us paying.
919	Donald Trump	Now, normally you would pay for tariffs --
920	Brian Kilmeade	But he literally just said, Mr. President, he's -- "we want to do a deal."
921	Brian Kilmeade	I very rarely see that.
922	Brian Kilmeade	"We want to work out a Phase 1 agreement."
923	Donald Trump	The problem is -- I didn't like his word "equality" because we started off so low.
924	Donald Trump	We've lost 500 billion dollars a year for many, many years.
925	Donald Trump	We've rebuilt China, and I give him a lot of credit.
926	Donald Trump	The ones that don't give credit are our past presidents, and especially the last one with his crummy vice president.
927	Donald Trump	China took us to the cleaners.
928	Donald Trump	He didn't even know that.
929	Donald Trump	Biden in the first debate said, "Oh, these are wonderful people."
930	Donald Trump	Sure, they're wonderful people.
931	Donald Trump	We've given them 500 billion a year.
932	Donald Trump	Five hundred billion.
933	Donald Trump	That's not including theft of intellectual property, et cetera.
934	Donald Trump	So I told President Xi, this can't be like an even deal because we're starting off from the floor and you're already at the ceiling.
935	Ainsley Earhardt	Not to mention --
936	Donald Trump	So we have to have a much better deal.
937	Donald Trump	The bottom line is we have a very good chance to make a deal.
938	Brian Kilmeade	We do.
939	Ainsley Earhardt	And not to mention happening to Hong Kong with these --
940	Steve Doocy	Right.
941	Ainsley Earhardt	-- pro democracy.
942	Donald Trump	Well, that's a complicating factor.
943	Donald Trump	There's no question about it.
944	Donald Trump	And if it weren't for me, Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes.
945	Donald Trump	He's got a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren't going in only because I ask him, "Please don't do that.
946	Donald Trump	You'll be making a big mistake.
947	Donald Trump	It's going to have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal."
948	Donald Trump	And he wants to make a trade.
949	Donald Trump	Brian, one thing, before I get off, I just want to say one thing.
950	Brian Kilmeade	Okay.
951	Donald Trump	We have the strongest economy in the history of our country.
952	Donald Trump	We have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had.
953	Donald Trump	African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, the best in history.
954	Donald Trump	We have the best unemployment and employment numbers.
955	Donald Trump	More people working today than ever before.
956	Donald Trump	But listen to this.
957	Donald Trump	We have now the greatest economy that we've ever had.
958	Donald Trump	We've increased by 20 trillion dollars.
959	Donald Trump	China's gone down probably by 30 or 35 trillion dollars.
960	Donald Trump	If crooked Hillary had won, China would now be the largest economy in the world.
961	Donald Trump	They were going to surpass us, expected to, in the second year of the presidency.
962	Donald Trump	Right now --
963	Brian Kilmeade	[Inaudible]
964	Donald Trump	They'll never catch up.
965	Brian Kilmeade	But the farmers were hoping for that huge purchase.
966	Brian Kilmeade	And it looks like they want to do a deal --
967	Donald Trump	But, Brian, they have it.
968	Donald Trump	Wait, wait, wait.
969	Donald Trump	Just one thing.
970	Donald Trump	So they have it because I said, "How much have the farmers lost because of China targeting them?"
971	Donald Trump	"Sir?
972	Donald Trump	Sixteen million dollars and 12 billion in the previous year," I gave them 12 billion dollars out of the tariffs, had tens of billions left over.
973	Donald Trump	And I gave them 16 billion out of the tariffs, and had tens of billions left over.
974	Donald Trump	Goes into the Treasury.
975	Donald Trump	Brian, our farmers are doing great, right?
976	Donald Trump	And now we just signed a deal with Japan, 40 billion dollars.
977	Donald Trump	They're buying from the farmers.
978	Donald Trump	We just signed a deal with South Korea.
979	Donald Trump	A tremendous deal.
980	Donald Trump	We're making tremendous deals.
981	Donald Trump	But you have to understand, these deals with China, they've been taking advantage of us for 25 years.
982	Donald Trump	It's hard for them to understand it's not going to happen anymore.
983	Donald Trump	And now they understand.
984	Brian Kilmeade	They are calling on you to veto legislation.
985	Brian Kilmeade	They are calling on you to veto legislation coming out of the Senate that supports the Hong Kong students.
986	Brian Kilmeade	What are you going to do?
987	Donald Trump	Well, I'll tell you.
988	Donald Trump	Look, we have to stand with Hong Kong.
989	Donald Trump	But I'm also standing with President Xi.
990	Donald Trump	He's a friend of mine.
991	Donald Trump	He's an incredible guy.
992	Donald Trump	We have to stand.
993	Donald Trump	But I'd like to see them work it out.
994	Donald Trump	Okay.
995	Donald Trump	We have to see and work it out.
996	Donald Trump	But I stand with Hong Kong.
997	Donald Trump	I stand with freedom.
998	Donald Trump	I stand with all of the things that we want to do.
999	Donald Trump	But we also are in the process of making the largest trade deal in history.
1000	Donald Trump	And if we could do that, that would be great.
1001	Donald Trump	China wants it.
1002	Donald Trump	We want it.
1003	Donald Trump	And I will say this.
1004	Donald Trump	If it weren't for me, thousands of people would have been killed in Hong Kong right now.
1005	Donald Trump	And you wouldn't have any riots.
1006	Donald Trump	You'd have a police state, but thousands of people.
1007	Donald Trump	The only reason he's not going in is because I'm saying, "It's going to affect our trade deal, you don't want to do that."
1008	Donald Trump	I speak to him.
1009	Ainsley Earhardt	Sir, you're running in 2020.
1010	Ainsley Earhardt	And many people are -- we all just assumed your vice-presidential nominee would be Mike Pence.
1011	Ainsley Earhardt	But then we're reading headlines about Kellyanne Conway's husband saying that Nikki Haley is fighting for that position.
1012	Ainsley Earhardt	I'm a South Carolinian originally from South Carolina.
1013	Ainsley Earhardt	Nikki Haley was our governor.
1014	Ainsley Earhardt	And I know she really did a good job as an ambassador.
1015	Ainsley Earhardt	So who is going to be your running mate in 2020?
1016	Donald Trump	No, she's great.
1017	Donald Trump	Well, first of all, Kellyanne is great, but she's married to a total whack job.
1018	Donald Trump	I think she must have done some number on him, Ainsley.
1019	Donald Trump	I don't know what Kellyanne did to that guy, but she -- because I don't even know him.
1020	Donald Trump	I mean, I've met him for seconds.
1021	Donald Trump	He's got to be some kind of a nut job.
1022	Donald Trump	She must have done some bad things to him because that guy is crazy.
1023	Donald Trump	But you know what?
1024	Donald Trump	Mike Pence is a great vice president.
1025	Donald Trump	He's our man, 100 percent.
1026	Donald Trump	Nikki will absolutely be involved.
1027	Donald Trump	She's a friend of mine.
1028	Donald Trump	She endorsed me with the most beautiful endorsement you've ever heard.
1029	Donald Trump	She did a great job at the U.N.. She's now in the private sector.
1030	Donald Trump	I assume she's doing very well.
1031	Donald Trump	But, Nikki will be back in some form because she's great, and just she's my friend.
1032	Donald Trump	But no, Mike Pence, I know, I've seen this rumor.
1033	Donald Trump	It keeps, you know, popping up.
1034	Donald Trump	And Nikki would be great.
1035	Donald Trump	But Mike Pence has done a phenomenal job as Vice President.
1036	Donald Trump	He's our guy.
1037	Donald Trump	He's my friend.
1038	Donald Trump	And look, we have a great team.
1039	Donald Trump	This has been a very strong team.
1040	Brian Kilmeade	Mike Pompeo going to the Senate.
1041	Brian Kilmeade	Are you going to push him to do that?
1042	Donald Trump	So Mike has done an incredible job.
1043	Donald Trump	You know, I have an incredible cabinet.
1044	Donald Trump	We don't get enough credit.
1045	Donald Trump	We have incredible.
1046	Donald Trump	Mike graduated number one at Harvard Law.
1047	Donald Trump	Number one at West Point, is an incredible guy, doing a great job in a very complicated world, doing a great job as secretary of state.
1048	Donald Trump	Remember, they all said, Brian, I'd be in World War III my first day.
1049	Donald Trump	And now they're saying, "Well, he's much more moderate."
1050	Donald Trump	Well, actually, I rebuilt the military to a level that nobody is going to play games with us.
1051	Donald Trump	But if we don't have to use it, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
1052	Donald Trump	So Mike would win easily in Kansas.
1053	Donald Trump	Great state.
1054	Donald Trump	And it's a Trump state.
1055	Donald Trump	He'd win easily.
1056	Donald Trump	And if I thought they had somebody out there that couldn't win, and Mike would really -- he loves what he's doing.
1057	Donald Trump	But if I thought they had somebody out there that -- and he came to me and said, "Look, I'd rather stay where I am," but he loves Kansas.
1058	Donald Trump	He loves the people of Kansas.
1059	Donald Trump	If he thought there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that, and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas.
1060	Steve Doocy	Well, I am from Kansas, and you're right.
1061	Steve Doocy	It is a great state.
1062	Steve Doocy	I'm Mr. President.
1063	Steve Doocy	A moment ago, you were talking about rumors.
1064	Steve Doocy	I'm sure you saw there was a rumor that, you know, you went to the hospital last week.
1065	Steve Doocy	It wasn't in the schedule.
1066	Donald Trump	Yeah.
1067	Steve Doocy	And obviously something is really the matter with you.
1068	Steve Doocy	So can you tell us what's the matter with you?
1069	Donald Trump	Okay.
1070	Donald Trump	Yeah.
1071	Donald Trump	A lot of things are a matter with me.
1072	Donald Trump	I mean, number one, what did they do this for?
1073	Donald Trump	But I love it.
1074	Donald Trump	You know, one of those things.
1075	Donald Trump	So we had some free time.
1076	Donald Trump	My doctor calls.
1077	Donald Trump	He said, "Would you like to do some work?"
1078	Donald Trump	Because I'm going to be slightly busy in 2020, in January and February, especially if Crazy Nancy does something that nobody ever would even think of doing.
1079	Donald Trump	So I'll be busy interviewing Biden, interviewing, watching the interviews of shifty Schiff, and why he made up all of this stuff, and why he made up my statements.
1080	Donald Trump	So the doctor called, "Sir, would you like to go out" -- because they had three hours -- "Would you like to go out to Walter Reed and do your first part of the physical right?"
1081	Donald Trump	I said, "Yeah, go ahead.
1082	Donald Trump	Let's go."
1083	Donald Trump	So we go out.
1084	Donald Trump	I go there.
1085	Donald Trump	I meet with parents.
1086	Donald Trump	One in particular, I meet with the wife and family of a young soldier who is being operated on and lost his arm and lost a leg.
1087	Donald Trump	Horrible thing.
1088	Donald Trump	And I spent time with them.
1089	Donald Trump	Anyway, I do a very routine part of the physical.
1090	Donald Trump	Get in the car, come back.
1091	Donald Trump	On the way back, I'm hearing that I'm in the hospital.
1092	Donald Trump	And by the way, it just so you know, like literally many, many, many cars go, it's not like -- and they have a press van following -- you know when I go, I'd love to be able to go like the old days, when I get in a car and close the doors, lock them up, and drive.
1093	Donald Trump	Right?
1094	Donald Trump	That doesn't happen anymore.
1095	Donald Trump	It's a little different.
1096	Donald Trump	But we have a press van.
1097	Donald Trump	You know how that works.
1098	Donald Trump	And so, we drive out to Walter Reed, greatest doctors, greatest everything, greatest place you've ever seen, what they can do.
1099	Donald Trump	So I start my physical, go see the soldier, go see the families, did a little tour of the building, then get back in.
1100	Donald Trump	On the way back, I'm hearing rumors that I'm in the hospital.
1101	Donald Trump	Then I'm hearing rumors that I had chest pains.
1102	Donald Trump	Then I'm hearing rumors that I had a massive heart attack.
1103	Donald Trump	Then I'm hearing rumors that I'm not coming back.
1104	Donald Trump	I'm staying at Walter Reed overnight and maybe for a long time.
1105	Donald Trump	And I say -- I come home and my wife says, "Darling, darling, are you okay?"
1106	Donald Trump	I said, "Okay from what?".
1107	Donald Trump	[Laughter] They say, they have it down.
1108	Donald Trump	CNN, mostly CNN, but that stupid MSNBC, which is just as bad.
1109	Donald Trump	Can you imagine?
1110	Donald Trump	I made them so much money on The Apprentice and that's the way -- but anyway those two.
1111	Donald Trump	And so, they started a false narrative.
1112	Steve Doocy	All right.
1113	Donald Trump	And it was this.
1114	Donald Trump	So the doctor gets on.
1115	Donald Trump	He said, "No, no."
1116	Donald Trump	It didn't matter.
1117	Donald Trump	No matter what we told them, they were going with it.
1118	Brian Kilmeade	So your health -- Mr. President, your health is fine.
1119	Donald Trump	Well, let me tell you this.
1120	Donald Trump	I just got back from Austin, Texas, where I was with Tim Cook.
1121	Donald Trump	He's going to be building a one-billion-dollar facility to make whatever he makes.
1122	Donald Trump	You know, that's Apple.
1123	Donald Trump	And he's going to build this incredible facility.
1124	Donald Trump	We toured another facility where they make the Mac Pro, which is phenomenal, which was opening.
1125	Donald Trump	The reason we've opened that day job, they're making all of the Mac Pros all over the world.
1126	Donald Trump	They're making them right in Austin, Texas.
1127	Donald Trump	I spent -- I left early.
1128	Donald Trump	I got home very late.
1129	Donald Trump	And I did many things in between.
1130	Donald Trump	And I was sort of joking to some of the people.
1131	Donald Trump	I said, "Hey, that's not bad considering these people had me all wash up and finished in a hospital that I just get back from a 14-hour day.
1132	Donald Trump	".
1133	Steve Doocy	Yup.
1134	Donald Trump	No.
1135	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace.
1136	Donald Trump	Let me just say what it really is.
1137	Donald Trump	It's fake, disgusting news.
1138	Donald Trump	I'll let you know -- you know what?
1139	Donald Trump	Nothing wrong if you're not feeling well.
1140	Donald Trump	I have --
1141	Steve Doocy	Right.
1142	Steve Doocy	But it wasn't on your schedule, and so people thought, "Oh, there must be something.
1143	Steve Doocy	".
1144	Donald Trump	No, because the doctor said, "Sir."
1145	Donald Trump	You know, I'm not blaming that.
1146	Brian Kilmeade	Get a phase done.
1147	Donald Trump	You might be able to knock off half of your physical.
1148	Donald Trump	I said, "You know what?
1149	Donald Trump	That's not a bad idea" because I had three hours.
1150	Brian Kilmeade	So, Mr. President --
1151	Donald Trump	Between that and watching a football game that I didn't want to watch.
1152	Donald Trump	What do we -- I had three free hours.
1153	Steve Doocy	All right.
1154	Donald Trump	And he said, "Would you like to do it?"
1155	Donald Trump	So here's the thing.
1156	Donald Trump	It's so disgusting what they do because they knew it wasn't true.
1157	Donald Trump	They went with it.
1158	Donald Trump	After we certified with medical people, we had three medical people call them up to say it's not true.
1159	Donald Trump	They went with it anyway.
1160	Donald Trump	You couldn't kill the story because they're bad people.
1161	Donald Trump	It's fake, corrupt news.
1162	Donald Trump	It's CNN mostly -- Well, Mr. President --
1163	Donald Trump	It --
1164	Brian Kilmeade	I think it does good for your health.
1165	Brian Kilmeade	I'm not a doctor, but if I was to write a prescription, calling in every week to update the country about what's happening might be good for your health.
1166	Brian Kilmeade	That's something to consider.
1167	Brian Kilmeade	You have the phone number.
1168	Donald Trump	Well, you know that I've been doing it for years.
1169	Brian Kilmeade	You have been.
1170	Donald Trump	With your group, I've been doing it years.
1171	Brian Kilmeade	For stress relief.
1172	Donald Trump	It was up to me -- and it is up to me, and we'll do it more often.
1173	Donald Trump	But I have a lot of fun doing it.
1174	Donald Trump	And you know what's the best part?
1175	Donald Trump	We get the true word out.
1176	Donald Trump	And here's a true word.
1177	Donald Trump	Our country is doing great.
1178	Donald Trump	We're respected again.
1179	Donald Trump	Our military is strong.
1180	Donald Trump	We have the number one economy in the world by far.
1181	Donald Trump	And China's never going to catch us as long as we have a smart person where I am.
1182	Donald Trump	They'll never catch us.
1183	Donald Trump	They've had the worst year they've had in 57 years, and we've had the best year we've ever had by far.
1184	Donald Trump	So it's good.
1185	Donald Trump	I get the word out on your show.
1186	Donald Trump	I love your show.
1187	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you so much, Mr. President, for being with us.
1188	Steve Doocy	Yup.
1189	Brian Kilmeade	President Trump --
1190	Donald Trump	Thanks so much.
1191	Brian Kilmeade	-- thanks so much.
1192	Brian Kilmeade	Thank you.
1193	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
1194	Steve Doocy	All right.
1195	Donald Trump	Goodbye.
