The copycat, a 36-year-old man from Louisiana, was also identified and is now facing charges.\u00a0\nNow, a Facebook post claims that in the wake of this ice cream crime, the Food and Drug Administration altered its packaging rules and now will require a seal to be placed on all cartons, thus driving up the cost of the product for consumers.\u00a0\nThe post says:\n\"What she set in motion when she licked the Blue Bell Ice Cream. The FDA will now require sealed ice cream cartons. Yes, there will be a plastic skin tight seal on ice cream cartons now. This will increase the cost of ice cream as machines will need to be bought for the plants to seal the cartons and not to mention buying the sealing material and the extra electricity to run the machines. The plastic sealing material will now find its way to already stuffed Landfills thus taxing the garbage system even more. So remember when you see the seal on ice cream and a higher price it was her fault and her fault alone. This is what being a dumbass does to the rest of us who are not dumbasses.

Any attempt at opening the product should be noticeable,\" according to NBC\u2019s Today.com.\u00a0\nBut after the second Blue Bell ice cream licker emerged, the company released a statement saying that food safety is its top priority and that they are taking the tampering cases \"very seriously.\"\n\"We are always looking for ways to improve,\" the statement said, \"including looking at methods within our manufacturing process to add additional protection to the carton.\"\nOur ruling\nAfter a viral video showed a teen licking a Blue Bell ice cream tub before returning it to a Texas Walmart shelf, a post on Facebook claims the incident prompted the FDA to now require all ice cream companies add protective seals to their products, thus driving up the cost of ice cream.\nBut the FDA said the rumor is inaccurate and the incident is being handled by local law enforcement and the ice cream company affected.\nBlue Bell, unlike some other ice cream companies, does not currently have sealed containers but said in a statement it is looking at methods \"to add additions protection to the carton.\"\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00422"}
