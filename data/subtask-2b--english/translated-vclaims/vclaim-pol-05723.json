In fact, he made it more than once in the debate. \"I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America as the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right, not as a privilege,\" said Sanders. This is almost identical to the statement made by Sanders, which we verified in June 2015. We'll summarize our research here. When we considered the claim earlier, Michael Briggs, the spokesman for Sanders, said that the Senator referred to the nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We are not sure Sanders made this very clear (for example, the OECD does not include China or Russia, which many people consider a major country), but we will put that aside at this moment. We referred Briggs to an OECD report issued in 2014 that found only two member countries, the United States and Mexico, lacking universal health-care coverage. \" Nevertheless, Mexico passed a law in 2004 aimed at establishing universal coverage, which is currently 90 per cent,\" Briggs said. \"ACA was not intended to create comprehensive coverage, and according to January estimates CBO, 90 percent is as good as it is going to get.\" We checked him out. Briggs is close to his numbers. In Mexico, public insurance in 2013 was about 86.7 per cent of the population. This is in fact not very different from the position of America, if it combines public and private coverage. The proportion in the United States was 84.9 per cent. However, in 2015, community organizations estimated that 89 per cent of American residents - excluding undocumented migrants - had coverage. The number falls to 87 per cent if it includes undocumented residents. Mexico &apos; s average income is so low -- about one third of that in the United States -- that some will not combine it with the stronger OECD countries. But since Sanders' spokesman included him, we thought it was fair to include him as well. In addition to the rough figures, the Sanders statement highlights the difficult questions that arise when talking about the right to health care begins. Is it defined as universal coverage, or is it a legal right to care? Both are not identical. The standards of gold in Europe cover both rules. Almost every European State has signed and ratified the European Social Charter. The health care section of that treaty provides coverage as a right. \"The health-care system must be accessible to the entire population. To this end, States should take the key criterion for judging the success of health system reforms as a fundamental human right.\" Countries follow different paths to fulfil this promise. Great Britain has its national health services where the government runs hospitals and pays doctors and nurses. Germany and France have a more complex mix of highly regulated public and private insurance companies, and, as in the case of America, a law making insurance compulsory for all. These European countries register 100 when it comes to universal coverage. However, Australia also does not operate under any legal claim that health care is a right. The Ministry of the Attorney-General of the Government published on its website \"There is no Commonwealth legislation that explicitly provides for the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\" This does not prevent Australians from running a large-scale public hospital system and a strong public health insurance programme. Japan uses a different mix of tools to achieve the same results, and also lacks a formal legal right to health care. There is a wide range of Japanese health-care laws, but it concerns the establishment of various government programs and the rules of the game. On 13 January 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to provide security for the inauguration, and told her that \"we are not working for you.\" The list includes the Constitution of the World Health Organization and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The United States has signed and ratified the first Convention, but it is literally one of a handful of countries that have not ratified it. For some, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a historic document that is very close to asserting that health care is a right. The language of the Treaty is ambitious. It speaks of \"the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\" The countries behind it promise me that they will aim to create \"conditions that would guarantee all medical services and medical care in the event of illness.\" However, the legal weight of the Convention is much lower than its stated objectives. No country is driven to spend more than its \"available resources,\" a quantity that can be whatever leaders say. Lawrence Justin is the Director of the O'Neill Institute of National and Global Health Law of Georgetown University. Justin said that the convention lacked teeth. \"These international obligations are vague and unenforceable, so indeed they do not translate into \"right\" in all states,\" Justin said. For Justin, the test of the nation's commitment to the facts on the ground should be measured. \"Does it even provide fair and reasonable access to the entire population, and is there any way to enforce or implement the right?\" Justin said. \"With those measures, the United States has many health-care benefits, including medical care, medical assistance, veterans' affairs, and ACA subsidies. Yes, there are many neglected countries, but this is true in many countries, including China, which provides a small amount of health dollars to the rural population.\" The question of whether China is an industrial country of the kind mentioned by Sanders is a question of debate, but China helps to clarify the difference between the right to law and the right to practice. China has ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Moreover, its Constitution obliges the State to provide health services and facilities \"all in order to protect the health of the people.\" But the world's most densely populated nation has a record of no less. David Blumenthal, President of the Commonwealth Fund, a Boston-based health policy team, wrote about the development of health care in China. In an article in New England's Medical Journal, Blomental wrote that about 95 percent of the population has modest coverage. \"The Government has decided to provide all Chinese with some protection against the cost of the disease, not necessarily as a matter of right, but in fact,\" said Blomental Politifact. Aki Bloomqvist, a health-care economist at Carlton University in Canada, has a keen view of the link between China &apos; s legal promises and what they offer. China may have signed this United Nations Convention, but it has had a limited impact. \"In fact, most people in China are at risk of not even having access to much-needed health care if they are not lucky enough to demand something expensive,\" said Bloomcvist. After discussion, a speaker on behalf of Sanders, Warren Ganls, Politi Fuckett, said that Japan and Australia had created the right in practice even if it did not exist in law. The Commonwealth Fund ranked last in the United States in access to health care among seven major countries. Our rule, Sanders, said that the United States is the only major country that does not guarantee health care for all as a right. Among the rich member States of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), America - with the exception of Mexico - stands out as the only State lacking universal coverage. The question of the guaranteed right to health care is even more vexing. Saunders spoke as if every advanced economy had it. In fact, some do, and some don't.
