This year was no exception in the most exciting political battle in Illinois - the debate on whether the current fixed income tax in Illinois should be replaced by a graduation system in which taxpayers with higher incomes would be paid. We have already verified several allegations from Illinois politicians - including the democratic Government. P. Bretzker, who leads the campaign - on how states with graduated tax systems operate. Last week, we heard a new voice. It was a blatant criticism of California, a tax-executing country, from a suburban Republican lawman opposed to the Pritzker plan. During a discussion on income tax graduation in WCPT-AM, a California caller mentioned a positive light. In response, Mark Batinick warned the State of Blainfield against using the mandate as a policy model in Illinois. Patinick said: \"People who get hurt in California - I think they have 30% or one third of the country's population living at or below poverty.\" While California's poverty rate is one of the highest in the country, federal data show that the country is far from home to one third of the country's poor. The census results... the federal government measures poverty in many different ways. In order to compare poverty figures at the national level, the United States Census Bureau recommends the use of data from the current population survey, which is the official source of national poverty estimates. The survey is contrary to Batinick &apos; s claim. California &apos; s share of those living below the poverty line in the United States is just over 12%, according to the latest data. This reflects its share of the overall population of the country. The census also produces a complementary measure of poverty, which explains the cost of living - including taxes, housing, medical costs and non-monetary benefits that people can provide for their basic needs. His latest issue gives California a larger share of those living in poverty at the national level, but it is still much less than Batinick said. Here, math only works to less than 17%. Researchers say that the complementary measure does a better job of overcoming poverty, but it's still incomplete, including in California, where housing costs are high. Zack Barolin, a researcher at the Centre for Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, suggested looking at \"food security\" - a separate federal arrangement measured by the United States Department of Agriculture - to add to the picture of economic difficulties in California. When comparing how household members can live an active and healthy life, according to the state, California &apos; s performance is better than the national average. California &apos; s response to Illinois and Batinick begins with a 1% graduated income tax in California for those who achieve the lowest interest and then rise at marginal rates before reaching 13.3% of revenues above $1 million, according to the Tax Corporation. On June 7, 2016, John Shimkus stated in a tweet: \"When LBJ #WarOnPoverty began, 14% of Americans live in poverty. After 50 years, 14% still do. There's a \"best way.\" \u2022 On 28 July 2016, the Pritzker Plan - approved by the General Assembly, which is governed by democracy earlier this year - will impose taxes on those earning less than $250,000 at the current State rate of 4.95 per cent. Rates are higher than income above that amount. The highest tax rate of 7.99 per cent is required for single filers earning more than $750,000 and joint filers earning more than $1 million. The law will not enter into force unless the voters in November 2020 agree to a constitutional amendment allowing for graduation rates. When we asked Batinick about the connection he was trying to draw, he told us that he was making a general point that California-style policies were not a comprehensive remedy for the challenges facing Illinois. As to the evidence behind his own claim of poverty? Patinick admitted that he was wrong and said that he should have referred to the beneficiaries of social welfare rather than to people living below the poverty line. With reference to a federal report issued in 2018, which noted that the population of California constituted 38 per cent of families receiving benefits under the Temporary Assistance Programme for needy families, Batinick said that it did not view California as a \"state I am supposed to model.\" However, this is not what Batinick said on the air, where he specifically referred to the poverty line. Some of the experts we contacted warned against drawing conclusions on poverty in California based on a single programme, partly because the money going to TANF constituted a relatively small share of government spending in the world of programmes aimed at helping low-income people. Our rule, Batinick, said that California is home to 30% or one third of the country's population living in poverty or under poverty. Federal measures of poverty show that the figure is significantly exaggerated - a point recognized by Batinick. Instead, he intended to refer to the state &apos; s share of welfare beneficiaries, and mentioned a federal report that indicated that more than one third of the recipients of such assistance lived in California. However, this particular federal programme is far from the largest or only form of government assistance to low-income individuals to help them meet their basic needs. And what's more, it points to something different than what Patinick originally said. We assess his claim is wrong. It's wrong that the phrase isn't accurate.
