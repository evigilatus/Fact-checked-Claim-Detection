The president \"can encourage us to appeal to our best angels, our best nature,\" said Paden on August 7th. \"They can also unleash the deepest and darkest forces of the nation. That's what I think Donald Trump chose to do.\" \"Days before mid-term,\" said Paden, \"I've raised fears of a convoy going to the United States and created hysteria when he said, \"Look, look what's going on. This is an invasion, and he confirmed that the immigrants would quote him, \"Your money with a knife.\" Trump regularly talks about the invasion. This was mentioned in several gatherings, including a meeting in Michigan in March and another in Florida in May. And then he said, \"When you see these convoys, you start with 20,000 people, this is an invasion.\" The word has been used in seven tweets since July 2015 to refer to immigrants more widely, according to Factba.se. But this fact check focuses on whether Trump warned that the immigrants would \"criticize you with a knife.\" He didn't. In the October 2018 demonstration in Texas, Trump attacked at that time - the United States Senator Peto Aurourke, who is now running for the presidency of the United States. On January 13, 2021, General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines in security, and said to her, \"We are not working for you.\" Trump said on January 17, 2021, \"Oork voted against the border wall.\" I voted against Kate's law. And a voice for pardoning Obama. Even O'Rourke voted to protect MS-13 members from deportation. He doesn't want to drive them away. He says they're human. They're human. They're carving you with a knife, but they're human. MS-13 is a violent transnational gang consisting mainly of members in Central America and the United States. It is clear that Trump's words were addressed to gang members, not to all immigrants. For the record, Aurroc did not vote to protect MS-13 members from deportation. In the United States House dispute over a bill that would give American officials more freedom to define gangs, Polyte Fact Texas has dug into the United States House dispute. The Democrats argued that officials already had the power to deport anyone suspected of involvement in a gang. The Paiden campaign did not respond in time for publication. The governor, Biden, said Trump, \"I'm sure the immigrants will quote, \"We're killing you with a knife.\" Trump was talking about MS-13 gang members. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00287"}
