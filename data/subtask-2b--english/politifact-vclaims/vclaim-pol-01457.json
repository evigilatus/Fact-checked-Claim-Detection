And Harvard media relations did not respond to an email seeking comment about the claim. But back in April, PolitiFact checked a similar claim that Obama had been suspended after writing a paper imagining a \"world without white people.\" Then, the claim merited a rating of Pants on Fire.\nSix months later, with the quote recirculating, the only place where we find any trace of this statement attributed to Obama continues to be on a website run by a noted purveyor of fabricated news stories: a website formerly known as AmericasLastLineofDefense.org that now appears to be housed at dailyworldupdate.us. The website states on its \"About\" page that, \"Everything on this website is fiction.\"\nAlso embedded in the original April story is the same picture and false quote that is being circulated again on Facebook and fact-checked here.\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01457"}
