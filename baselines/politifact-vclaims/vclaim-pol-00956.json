Parents and news consumers were left confused by vague headlines and misleading tweets.\nHouse Bill 145\u00a0deals with the state\u2019s method for assessing the effectiveness of\u00a0individual public schools\u00a0\u2014 and doesn\u2019t affect student grade scales at all. The state\u00a0currently assesses schools on a 15-point scale\u00a0and the bill aims to re-establish that method next year.\nSo, why the confusion?\nThe bill uses a letter-based measurement system and language \u2014 grade, scale, performance \u2014 often associated with student grades and report cards. The bill also gives the impression things are changing because it shows a 10-point scale with the numbers crossed-out.\nStill, the bill never uses the word \"student.\" And it clearly refers to a system that\u2019s meant to offer a glimpse of the effectiveness of a school\u2019s administration and teachers by calculating academic achievement and growth.\nUnfortunately, some of the media coverage didn\u2019t convey that reality.\nMISLEADING REPORTS\nMany TV stations reported on the bill with misleading headlines or descriptions.\nThe first line of a\u00a0WNCN story\u00a0says the bill might change the grading scale used \"in state public schools.\" This gives the impression the scale is applied by teachers to students, not by the state to the school. Anchor Angela Taylor then described the bill by saying it would change \"your child\u2019s school performance scores.\"\nThe NBC affiliate in Charlotte,\u00a0WCNC, used a WRAL story to report on the bill.\nWCNC\u2019s headline says \"NC lawmakers consider bill that would change school grades.\"\nThe Charlotte station\u2019s tweet may have added to the confusion. The tweet included a photo of a person holding a pencil accompanied by the caption: \"The new bill under consideration would adjust the current grading scale, making a score of 85 an A and a score of 70 a B.\" The station has 215,000 followers.\nThe tweet didn\u2019t specifically say the bill affected students. But it was so vague that readers might come to that conclusion.\nThe story now includes an editor\u2019s note on both WCNC and WRAL websites. It says: \"This new scale applies to the grades schools receive based on performance. It would not change the scale used to grade students.\"\nWRAL\u00a0later changed its headline to say: \"Bill would keep school performance grades on 15-point scale.\"\nFox affiliates used similar headlines in stories about the bill. Charlotte-based Fox 46 used a bare-bones headline saying the bill \"would change grading scale.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREACTION\nReaction to the stories was also misleading.\nLt. Gov. Dan Forest tweeted a WBTV story with the headline, \"NC General Assembly mulling over changing school grading scales.\" Forest tweeted a comment about the story that mentioned students.\n\"Instead of lowering our expectations for our education system, we should be raising our standards for our students so that they can compete in a 21st Century global economy,\" he said.\nAndrew Siciliano, the host of an NFL show on DirecTV, tweeted that the bill directly affects students. He has 157,000 followers on Twitter.\n\"North Carolina wants to give your kid an \"A\" with an 85. Embarrassing,\" he tweeted, along with a link to a story by WRAL.\nKaren Zatkulak, a reporter at Asheville-based WLOS, asked NC Education Superintendent Mark Johnson about the bill during an interview. Her question, which comes around the 7:45 mark of a\u00a0Facebook video, doesn\u2019t clarify whether the bill affects students or schools.\nJohnson says he\u2019s not aware of the bill and wants to talk to legislators about it. But he adds: \"I don\u2019t know if we necessarily want to make our grading scale less rigorous in order to give more students As,\" Johnson responds.\nThursday afternoon, pundits on the Fox News show, \"The Five,\" also talked about the bill as if it would affect students.\n\"I think failing is good for character,\" host Jesse Watters said. \"Now you can pass with what, a 40 percent? That\u2019s pathetic. That\u2019s why the Chinese are taking over.\"\nWHAT THE BILL SAYS\nNot only is the bill inconsequential for students, it also makes no major changes to the state\u2019s grading scale for schools.\nThe bill\u2019s effects \u2014 and some of the public\u2019s misinterpretations on social media \u2014 are detailed on a\u00a0blog operated by Justin Parmenter, a teacher in Charlotte.\nThe North Carolina State Board of Education assesses school effectiveness on a 100-point scale.\u00a0Current law\u00a0requires the state to grade schools on a 15-point scale:\n\n85-100 is an A\n70-84 is a B\n55-69 is a C\n40 to 54 is a D\n39 and lower is an F.\n\nThe bill makes it seem like the state currently operates on a 10-point grading scale. That\u2019s because HB 145 is a version of a bill passed several years ago granting the state permission to operate a 15-point scale for schools, said Drew Elliot, communications director for NC DPI.\nA law from 2013 \"originally set out a 10-point scale for school report cards. However, that scale was never used because it has been superseded by an annual waiver, usually in the budget bill, since the inception of the School Performance Grades,\" Elliot said.\nHB 145 would make the 15-point scale permanent, \"obviating the need for the annual waiver,\" Elliot said.\nOUR RULING\nA lot of people \u2014 some media outlets, politicians, pundits and a sports reporter \u2014 got this one wrong. Not only does the bill not affect students\u2019 grades, it also makes no major changes to the state system used to give parents an idea of a school\u2019s effectiveness.
