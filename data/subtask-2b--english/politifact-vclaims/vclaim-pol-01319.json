(USGS is th acronym for the U.S. Geological Survey, which provides science about natural hazards.) The Disclose.tv website lets users submit and share topics and videos that are supposedly ignored, denied or inadequately covered \"by the mainstream media, governmental institutions and other information keepers.\"\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nDisclose.tv said in an email to PolitiFact that 100 percent of its content is user-generated. But at some point before we reached out, the headline was changed to read, \"Yellowstone super volcano threat level set to \u2018high\u2019 by USGS,\" and it said it was posted to \"nature,\" not \"preppers.\" \u00a0\nThe Epoch Times, which posted a story on Oct. 25 about an eruption threat, also updated its coverage, but with a correction.\n\"The Epoch Times published a misleading headline declaring the threat of Yellowstone volcano eruption had increased to \u2018high.\u2019 Yellowstone volcano\u2019s ranking of 21st on the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s assessment has not changed.\"\nYet another publication, the Post Register in Idaho, reported that the threat had been bumped from \"moderate\" to \"high,\" though the newspaper cautioned that the Yellowstone caldera isn\u2019t expected to \"explode in a mega eruption anytime soon.\"\nPerhaps anticipating\u2014or responding to\u2014confusion over the volano\u2019s threat assessment, USGS published its own article on Oct. 29 that explains what it all means. Here are the facts:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the agency released an updated threat assessment for U.S. volcanoes for the first time since the original assessment was published in 2005. The new assessment accounts for new research and observations over the past 13 years.\nIn the 2005 assessment, Yellowstone is listed as a \"high threat\" volcano. In the 2018 assessment, Yellowstone is listed as a \"high threat\" volcano.\nEach volcano also has an overall threat score, which considers factors including average recurrence of eruptions, what types of eruptions have taken place and nearby infrastructure. In 2005, Yellowstone was ranked 21. In 2018, Yellowstone was ranked 21.\n\"This qualifies Yellowstone as a \u2018high threat\u2019 volcanic system,\" according to the USGS article. \"This is not a change or any sort of upgrade in the threat posed by Yellowstone, and carries no implications for future eruptive activity. It is merely a way to provide a sense of Yellowstone\u2019s threat level compared to other volcanoes in the USA.\"\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the assessment is not an indicator of which volcanoes are most likely to erupt, according to USGS. It\u2019s also not a ranking of the most active volcanoes (and \"active\" means that a volcano has erupted in the past 11,650 years).\nRather, assessments gauge the relative risk a volcano poses to people and property. So if a volcano erupts but no one is living on it, it has a very low threat because no people or property are at risk, according to USGS. Meanwhile, \"a volcano that might experience only small explosions but that is surrounded by towns and near an airport has a higher threat, since lots of people and property are exposed to the hazard (even if the hazard might be a relatively small one.)\"\nWe\u2019ll let Michael Poland, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey and scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, have the last word.\n\"In a nutshell, this whole \u2018bumped Yellowstone\u2019s volcano threat to high\u2019 thing is a massive job of misreporting,\" Poland said in an email. \"The threat level for the caldera system is rated as \u2018high\u2019 in a report that was issued by USGS. That report updates an initial report from 2005, in which Yellowstone was also rated \u2018high.\u2019 ... Nothing has changed\"\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-03 16:08:32 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Verdetto: False  The U.S. Geological Survey increased Yellowstone volcano eruption threat level to \"high\"    Bloggers in a blog post    a Facebook meme luned\u00ec 29 ottobre 2018 2018-10-29    Leggi di pi\u00f9  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01319"}
