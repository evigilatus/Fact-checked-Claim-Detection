Donna Campbell, from New Brownville, went to Twitter to express concern about increasing real estate taxes and securing two of its bills. \"The religion of local government in Texas has increased about 40% in the last five years,\" Campbell wrote in a tweet. \"This trend is to raise Texas real estate taxes. SB 462 and SB 1090 have been recorded to make it difficult for cities to borrow unsustainable debts that lead to higher real estate taxes.\" We were curious about the first part of its claim - did local government debt actually increase by about 40 per cent in the last five years? Alice Claybourne, a Campbell spokesman, said that this figure came from the 2018 Annual Report of the Local Government issued by the Texas Bond Review Board, a government council comprising the Government. Greg Abbott, Lieutenant Goff. :: Dan Patrick, Comptroller Glen Hagar and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis Bonnen, R-Lake Jackson, who oversees debt and debt financing throughout the state. These annual reports, issued by the staff of the Council, examine the debt trends of local governments and include data from cities and districts, schools, health, water and community college districts, as well as other special districts. Claybourne referred to a specific line in the report, which states that over the past five fiscal years, \"local government debt issuances\" increased by 38.6 per cent, and rose to $32.65 billion in fiscal year 2018. The case is closed, isn't it? Not so fast. Many debt and budget experts said that Campbell's tweet referred only to debt, which could give the impression that it was talking about the growth of total debt held by local governments, or debt owed, which had already increased at a much lower rate. The same report shows that over the past five fiscal years, the debt owed by local governments increased by 17.7 per cent to about $230 billion at the end of fiscal year 2018. The principal total amount of debt sold is the issuance of debt, a value noted by Campbell's employees. The outstanding debt is the life-long asset of all debt issues, according to a glossary issued by the Office of the Controller. \"I think the teams are sly,\" said Bill Fulton, director of the Children's Institute for Urban Research at Rice University, in e-mail. \"It is clear that the issuance of domestic debt has increased by almost 40%. However, due domestic debt increased by only 17% due to refinancing, bonuses, etc.\" Fulton said that the accuracy of Campbell &apos; s statement depended on how the scenes explained her observation, but added that he had read her tweet as referring to outstanding debts. \"But that's how I look at it,\" he said. John Oliver, Chief of Staff of Campbell, defended her observation and rejected the idea that her claim was inaccurate because of different interpretations of the word religion. \"I'd like to add that no matter how deducable, what I wrote was not inaccurate,\" said Oliver in the e-mail. \"I understand that different people may explain things differently. This is also the nature of the tweet.\" Oliver also noted that both of the legislation referred to in Campbell &apos; s tweeting were bills of the Senate of 462 and 1090 concerning bond elections, or a new religion. In his interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry says that \"Storm Harvey dropped water in Houston in five days more than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" By Brandon Mulder, on February 5, 2021, it will change the election process involving local bond proposals. One requires that the bond proposals on the ballot papers include more details, while the other requires a two-thirds majority of voters to approve the bond proposals affecting property taxes. While both projects relate to the issuance of debts, the accompanying analysis of both proposals indicates how new bonds contribute to outstanding debt and in turn affect property tax rates. In fact, the analysis of the Senate Bill 462 contains a statement reflecting the language that Campbell used in tweeting - but explicitly refers to outstanding debts. \"The debt of local bonds in Texas has increased significantly in recent years, contributing to the rapid rise in property taxes,\" says the analysis. The analysis of Senate Bill 1090 discusses the need for property tax rates to generate \"sufficient revenue to pay for debt service on outstanding and anticipated debt for public obligations.\" In view of the fact that both draft laws have been drafted and the remainder of the short time left in this year &apos; s legislative cycle, it is unlikely that both proposals will be adopted. The narrow scope provided a better analysis of Eva Delona Castro, a budget analyst at the centre of policy priorities, and she would not have guessed that Campbell's observation related to new debts rather than outstanding debts, even after considering the legislation referred to in the tweet. In view of the focus on how debt affected property taxes, Delona Castro said that Campbell should have narrowed its focus on considering tax-backed debt rather than outstanding debt as a whole, which included income-backed debt. \"This is the part of the debt that matters with respect to property taxes,\" she said in the e-mail. \"Religion supported by income is paid in other ways -- user fees, customer fees (e.g. utilities), sales taxes, etc.\" Unpaid debts subsidized by taxes held by local governments increased by 21.2 per cent in the past five years, reaching $150.22 billion; new debts subsidized by taxes issued by local governments increased by 32.3 per cent in the past five years. Rob Lacha, Director of the Texas Bond Review Board, and Braxton Parsons, Policy Analyst of the Board, said that they would consider the outstanding debts in the scenario described by Campbell. Even then, they will limit their analysis to the public debt owed, which is supported by the local entity's credit and tax authority. If Campbell insisted on just considering the issue of debt, Lacha and Parsons said she should have just looked at new money and ruled out the issue that was being used to repay the current debt. During fiscal year 2018, the Board &apos; s report showed that more than 36 per cent of domestic debt issuances were used for debt repayment. Lacha and Parsons also warned that it was difficult to draw conclusions as to how increases in debt could affect property taxes using the figures in their annual reports, since all local governments were grouped together and the report did not explain such matters as local property values and tax rates. Our verdict, Campbell, said the local government, \"The debts in Texas have increased by almost 40% in the last five years.\" Campbell's employees said that they were referring to an increase in the volume of debt issued by local governments, which had increased by about 38% in the past five years. However, experts said that her tweet was inaccurate and left the impression that she was referring to outstanding debts, which had increased by about 17% in the past five years. Furthermore, experts said that consideration of the increase in the total debt of local governments was not the best way to analyse how tax rates affected debt. We're assessing this claim half right. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context.
