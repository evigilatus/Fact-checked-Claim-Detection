If you still have some outstanding questions, we've dealt with a lot of them here and here. But now, a virus on Facebook claims that millions of undocumented migrants have received checks from the government while federal workers are still unpaid. One of the positions she claimed to share on 20 January was shared more than 4,100 times. One identical, published one day later, increased over 3,200 shares. The full post says, \"18 million illegal immigrants got their government checks this month... It was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We've reached out to some people who shared this meme on their pages for evidence. One user responded in the comments of the post by referring to a 1997 report of the United States Government Accountability Office. The other, Facebook account called \"Washington State of Donald Trump 2020,\" told us that it came from comments made by Republic of the United States Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Fox News. The spokesman for Jordan, Ian Fury, said that he was unaware of the allegation, and when we looked into Fox News, we found no evidence that Congressman had said the phrase. The 1997 report covers only the types of benefits that undocumented migrants can obtain, namely food programmes or medical assistance through their children born in the United States, and how much it cost 20 years ago. While it discusses that some of these families may misenact their income for more, it is irrelevant to the claim that \"18 million\" has just received a government check. In our research, we found that, no, 18 million illegal immigrants did not receive a check from the government in the middle of the closure. Here's how we know that. First, the study conducted by the Pew Research Center in November 2018 made the total number of illegal immigrants in the United States well below 18 million. In 2016, the latest available data, the report found that the number of undocumented migrants living in the country had fallen to 10.7 million, from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 January 16, 2021, in a fact sheet published the same month by the Institute of Migration Policy, a non-partisan think tank, estimated the figure to be close to 11.3 million. Taking either of the two figures into account, it would be impossible for 18 million undocumented migrants to receive checks from the Government, as there were only 11 million people living in the country. We spoke with Randy Caps, Director of Research for United States Programs at the Institute of Migration Policy. Caps said: \"It is clear that non-licensed immigrants themselves are not eligible for any government assistance that they find difficult to find out what they will get from checks.\" \"their children born in the United States may be eligible for emergency medical assistance, but this is not the majority... If they receive them, they are only part of the population, not for themselves, but for their children, and again this is not a check.\" The mathematical error may have arisen from the combination of the number of legal immigrants in the equation. According to a report issued in December 2018 by the Centre for Migration Studies, 63 per cent of non-citizens &apos; households use social welfare programmes. However, according to census data, only half of non-citizens &apos; households consist of undocumented migrants. Among the remaining persons in this group are long-term temporary visitors such as foreign guest workers and students, as well as permanent residents who have not acquired citizenship but hold green cards, and there are also legal restrictions on migrants &apos; access to most federal benefits. Undocumented migrant households benefit primarily from government food programmes and medical aid through their children born in the United States. Unrestricted migrants are not eligible for the following federal benefits: Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Programme, formerly known as the Food Stamps Programme, non-emergency medical aid, supplementary insurance income, temporary assistance for needy families and their precursors, and assistance to families with dependent children, in accordance with the National Centre for Migration Law. Another report by the Centre for Migration Studies, which prefers low levels of migration, estimated that 4 per cent of households headed by illegal immigrants in the country used housing programmes in 2012. \"while households headed by illegal immigrants use some housing and cash programmes, their use is less than that of households headed by a citizen for such programmes,\" the study said. Our Facebook article claims that 18 million illegal immigrants received a government check this month, while federal workers remain unpaid amid the closure of the government. We have not been able to find any evidence to support this figure, and the multiple reports place the total number of undocumented migrants living in the United States well below 18 million. Furthermore, illegal migrants are denied most federal benefits and will benefit primarily from food and medical aid programmes through their children born in the United States.
