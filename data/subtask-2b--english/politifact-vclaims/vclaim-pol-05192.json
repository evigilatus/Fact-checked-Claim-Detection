Scott Walker, who appointed Bradley to three judgeships in three years.\nBut Kloppenburg, a state Court of Appeals judge in Madison, has made contributions over the years to Democratic candidates and is benefitting from the work of liberal groups such as One Wisconsin Now.\nBradley, in turn, has sought to cast Kloppenburg as a judge who would rule on cases based on her personal biases. In a March 21, 2016 interview on Wisconsin Public Radio\u2019s \"Joy Cardin Show,\" Bradley said:\n\"Given her judicial philosophy, JoAnne Kloppenburg has told us she thinks it's her job to promote a more equal society. She will most definitely introduce her social and political beliefs into her decision making.\"\nWe don\u2019t know, of course, just what Kloppenburg would do as a Supreme Court justice.\nBut what has Kloppenburg said about what her job is as a judge, and about promoting a more equal society?\nOn her campaign website, Kloppenburg states this as being her judicial philosophy:\n\"I apply the law fairly, and thoughtfully, and in a principled and disciplined manner to answer the legal questions presented by the parties in a case. I approach each case with an open mind, and my decisions are based on the law and the facts, not on ideology or partisan politics. I am faithful to the court\u2019s role as an independent check and balance on the other political branches of government. My duty is to uphold the Constitution, a sacred document that represents the will of the people and which contains the fundamental principles that define our democracy, protect individual rights and promote a more equal society.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe made a similar statement in a candidate questionnaire.\nAs Bradley\u2019s campaign noted to us, Kloppenburg has also said -- more than once -- that among U.S. Supreme Court justices, she aligns most with Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in part because they believe in \"protecting individual rights and promoting a more equal society.\"\nSo, Kloppenburg\u2019s statement is more broad than Bradley suggests, in that she states her job as a judge is to uphold the U.S. Constitution.\nBut Kloppenburg also states that in her judicial philosophy, the key principles of the Constitution\u00a0are protecting individual rights and promoting a more equal society. That echoes the claim made by Bradley.\nOur rating\nBradley says \"JoAnne Kloppenburg has told us she thinks it's her job to promote a more equal society.\"\nKloppenburg does say that, but she also says more.\nKloppenburg declares that her judicial philosophy is to uphold the U.S. Constitution, and that in her view, the fundamental principles of the Constitution are to \"protect individual rights and promote a more equal society.\"\nBradley\u2019s statement is accurate but needs additional information -- our definition of Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05192"}
