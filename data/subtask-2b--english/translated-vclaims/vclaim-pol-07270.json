We will take the punch of President Barack Obama to bypass the executive. Our goal is to verify whether the United States has the oldest active constitution. Beth Berding, a Goodlate spokesman, referred to several documents supporting Congressman's statement. Among them is a passage from the position of the United States Senate, which states that the Constitution is \"the longest written charter of government alive in the world.\" Breijing noted that similar data appeared on the websites of the National Archives, the British Encyclopaedia, and the status of the Constitution in Philadelphia - a museum dedicated to the Constitution of the United States. We managed the Goodlat statement by Tom Jensburg, a professor at the University of Chicago and lead investigator in the Comparative Constitutions Project, which studied national constitutions worldwide. He agreed with Congressman and directed us to a list his group compiled when national constitutions were enacted. The oldest is the United States. Although it was signed in 1787, it was necessary for the mandates to ratify it and it did not enter into force until 1789. Norway then comes on the list of seniority, which was enacted in 1814, and Belgium in 1831. Although we might think of constitutions as yellow pieces of paper, that's not always the case. Only half of them live more than 19 years, according to a summary of a 2009 book co-authored by Ginsburg on constitutions around the world. While many constitutional experts agree with Goodlat, his statement does not enjoy unanimous ratification. As our colleagues at Polyte Fact noted in 2011, there is a discussion among scientists about whether some countries have a older constitution than the United States Constitution. All this depends on how the Constitution is defined. Miriam Webster &apos; s dictionary defines this term in two ways. One such document is an organizational document. But another way is \"a system of beliefs and laws governed by a country, State or organization.\" Some countries do not have a formal central constitution such as the United States, but instead withdraw from a series of centuries-old laws, practices and texts. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. By Warren Fisk: 20 January 2021, for example, the small State of San Marino, landlocked by Italy, its Government is building on \"legislative tools,\" including a series of written laws enacted in 1600, according to the CIA World Fact Guide. It is reported that the United Kingdom has a \"unwritten\" constitution based on common law, different practices and laws - including Magna Carta, which was written in the 13th century. John Paul Jones, an honorary professor of law at Richmond University, said that the Gooddale statement was basically true. However, Jones described his conclusion by reference to the Constitution of the United Kingdom. Although not written to a large extent, Jones said that it contained some texts centuries ago, including \"three or four documents dating from before 1789.\" What makes the Constitution of the United States always that? We asked Lynn Ozel, a researcher based in Montpellier, the home of President James Madison, who was one of the most frequent speakers at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Uzeil said that she believed that this was because the document was based on many sound principles that protected against abuse of power. She also said that it was a relatively simple and short document with a great deal of flexibility that allowed the country to respond to developing conditions. Last note: The Goodlatt Office justifies its statement by referring to documents comparing the United States Constitution to other countries around the world. However, we also wondered whether any of the original states of the United States had a working constitution older than our national document. The answer is yes; Massachusetts enacted the State Constitution in 1780. This means that it was adopted seven years before the United States Constitution was written. Our verdict says that the Constitution of the United States is \"the oldest written constitution still in use today.\" He referred to national constitutions. Some scientists note that the United Kingdom and San Marino have some written regulatory documents that remain in force prior to the enactment of the United States Constitution in 1789. But as a single document setting out a comprehensive framework for a country &apos; s governance - a common method by which many people can determine a constitution - the United States has the oldest right to a constitution that is still functioning.
