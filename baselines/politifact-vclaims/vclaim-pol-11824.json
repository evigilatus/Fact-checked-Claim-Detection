Rick Scott finds it hard to pass over a good doughnut.\n\nOr a doughnut story.\n\nScott started his career running a pair of doughnut shops in Kansas City in the 1970s. He returned to his doughnut roots in 2011, spending a day working at Nicola\u2019s Donuts in Tampa.\n\nIn a black hat that he clearly didn\u2019t like wearing and a matching black shirt, Gov. Scott baked and then sold fried pastries by the dozen to customers. You can read all about his day, the first of Scott\u2019s \"Let\u2019s Get to Work Days\", here.\n\nOr you can just listen to Scott tell the story himself -- which he did during his second State of the State address on Jan. 10, 2012. With owner Rachel Waatti listening on from the House chambers, Scott went on about doughnuts.\n\nHe joked about how you don\u2019t have to worry about employees eating too many doughnuts (they\u2019re just too rich) and how Waatti complained that Scott was spending too much time with the media and not enough time working.\n\nHe then touted the accomplishments of his day back in the doughnut business.\n\n\"We sold out; more than 240 dozen by 8:30 a.m.,\" he said.\n\nYour humble fact-checker happened to be tailing Scott that day and can report, the doughnut man-turned-governor is creating a bit of doughnut lore.\n\nThe doors to Nicola\u2019s opened at 6 a.m. and doughnuts were being snatched off the shelves (Your fact-checker knows, because he purchased a dozen himself to share with his hungry colleagues.)\n\nBy 8:30 a.m., the store had already run out of doughnuts and had to grab another 15-or-so dozen doughnuts from Nicola\u2019s second location.\n\nHow many doughnuts were sold by the time Scott left?\n\nWaatti and workers told PolitiFact Florida the number was definitely above the 65 dozen they originally baked for the shop and was probably around 80 dozen. That\u2019s probably at least 240,000 calories of breakfast, but it\u2019s not the \"more than 240 dozen\" Scott bragged to legislators about.\n\nShortly after Scott\u2019s speech, Waatti spoke to David DeCamp of the Tampa Bay Times. She said the 240-dozen figure includes all of the doughnuts sold at both Nicola\u2019s locations throughout the entire day Scott worked at the bakery. But she also reconfirmed that the shop Scott worked at sold about 80 dozen while he was there.\n\nAt PolitiFact Florida, we\u2019re almost as serious about our doughnuts as we are our fact-checks. We rate Scott\u2019s \"240 dozen\" claim Mostly False.\n\nNow can somebody pass a maple glazed?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11824"}
