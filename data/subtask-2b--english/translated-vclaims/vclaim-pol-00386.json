But a recent Facebook article accuses the double standards network. Roseanne Bar says she compares Valerie Garrett to a major animal who's being fired immediately and publicly disgraced. \"Woby (e.g.) Goldberg calls Judge Jeanine Pero Trump Naer Ramaliya. Keeps the job and applauses it to ABC.\" This post, which was published on Facebook on July 22, was highlighted as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation in the news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Peru and Goldberg certainly had an argument, but there is no evidence that Goldberg ever used racist seduction against Peru. Here's what's right and what's not. The revival of \"Rosan\" in May 2018 was cancelled hours after the bar, the star of the show, tweeting this about Garrett: \"The brothers of the muslim and the monkey planet had a kid=vj.\" \"The tweet triggered a public firestorm, including from the star of Rosan Sara Gilbert,\" she then reported the ABC News. \"Wanda Sykes, a consultant producer, also left the offer in the period before cancellation.\" Channing Dongi, president of ABC Entertainment, quoted from the story as saying that the tweet was \"disgusting, abhorrent and inconsistent\" with ABC values. Two months later, in July 2018, the host of Fox News Janine Peru appeared on the ABC \"The View.\" Goldberg, a co-host, entered a screaming match with Peru after \"Peru appeared to point out that Goldberg suffered from \"disturbing syndrome\" in Washington Post. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in the Facebook newspaper Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. \"Woby, do you know what's terrible?\" Peru said. \"When people who shouldn't be here end up killing the children of American citizens.\" \"You know what's terrible?\" He said Goldberg. When the President of the United States beats people to beat people. Say goodbye! I'm done.\" You can watch the exchange here. The show went to commercials and when Goldberg came back, he apologized. Peru is no longer present, but Peru has told our host fellow Fox News Sean Hannetti that the fight continued behind the scenes, saying that Goldberg used the word \"F\" in her face and spit on her. Goldberg confirmed that she used the word \"F,\" but she denied spitting, and said that Peru invited everyone on the table with a name I couldn't repeat on TV. Laurie Hogan, speaking on behalf of ABC, told Politi Fakt that Goldberg had not said Facebook allegations. We could not find any reliable evidence on the Internet that Goldberg said so, nor did we find such an article in the Nexis News Database. We found no evidence that Goldberg called Peru a racist insult. We value this wrong mail.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00386"}
