He said Muslims \"are not all bad. In fact, most of them are good.\"\nHis announcement was hailed by a \"member of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s Freedom and Justice Party.\" He said he would work with Congress to make it easier for Muslims to earn U.S. citizenship.\n\"Mr. Matei of the Muslim Brotherhood assured me they want to come to this country to help us, not harm us,\" he was reported to say.\nFollowing other attempts to paint Obama as a Muslim -- such as this one that we rated Pants on Fire -- the National Report\u2019s gambit worked.\n\"How dare Obama declare November, the month when we give thanks to God for our blessings and great nation, National Muslim Appreciation Month!\" wrote a blogger for Tea Party Nation.\nThe PolitiFact inbox saw email after email with links to such stories from readers who got it from outraged friends.\nUrban-legend debunker Snopes.com quickly confirmed that it originated with National Report.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe headline was utterly invented, and the event was entirely fabricated.\nWhile we didn\u2019t hear back from the White House, we found no evidence of any such proclamation at the White House website.\nWe also asked Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\"I\u2019m fairly certain they haven\u2019t. Otherwise, I would have heard about it,\" he said.\nObama regularly commemorates Muslim holidays alongside Christian and Jewish ones. He\u2019s proclaimed a Jewish American Heritage Month, a National Day of Prayer and a Religious Freedom Day, noting, \"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, Sikhs and non-believers.\"\nHe has declared heritage months for Irish-Americans, Asian-Americans, Caribbean-Americans\u00a0and Hispanics. He has proclaimed a month for appreciation of African-American music. But nothing about Muslims.\nAs for Obama\u2019s purported proclamation, the Tea Party Nation blogger posted an update to her outrage: \"Just found out this article was a hoax. They sure fooled me. However, my comments still stand if O should ever do such a thing.\"\nOur ruling\nBloggers posted a claim that the president had declared November \"National Muslim Appreciation Month.\" He hasn\u2019t \u2014 the claim was based on a piece of Internet satire. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08806"}
