Just two weeks ago, Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl to kill every person in West Virginia 32 times over.\"\nMy statement regarding the President\u2019s Declaration for a National Emergency to address the security and humanitarian crisis at the Southern Border: pic.twitter.com/XWckEhqx30\u2014 Carol Miller (@RepCarolMiller) February 15, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s no question that West Virginia has been hit hard by the opioid crisis -- PolitiFact West Virginia has previously reported that the state ranked No. 1 in the nation for opioid overdoses per capita.\nBut what about the idea that a single federal seizure of fentanyl could have killed every West Virginian 32 times over? We took a closer look.\nMiller's office told us that they were referring to late January seizure of 254 pounds of fentanyl by Customs and Border Protection at the Nogales port of entry in Arizona. The drugs -- which were \"concealed within a special floor compartment of a trailer that was laden with cucumbers,\" according to the the agency -- represented the largest fentanyl seizure in the agency\u2019s history.\nMiller\u2019s office also walked us through the math they used to arrive at their figure.\nThe seizure of 254 pounds converts to 115.2 kilograms. In turn, 115.212 kilograms equals 115.212 million milligrams.\nMiller\u2019s office said it used 2 milligrams as a lethal dose of fentanyl, citing information from the Drug Enforcement Administration that 2 milligrams is \"a lethal dose for most people.\"\nMeanwhile, 115.212 million milligrams works out to 57.606 million lethal doses of 2 milligrams each.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s population in 2018 was 1,805,832. If you divide 57.606 millon lethal doses by 1,836,843, it means that amount of fentanyl could theoretically kill every West Virginian 31.8 times over. Rounded up, that works out to the 32 times that Miller cited.\nTo make sure the 2 milligram threshold was sound, we checked with Timothy J. Pifer, the director of the New Hampshire State Police Forensic Laboratory, an expert on fentanyl and its lethality.\n\"Based upon research, toxicology reports and information from other agencies, two to three milligrams of fentanyl in its purest form could be fatal,\" Pifer said.\nHowever, he added that the technical details make a difference.\nFor one thing, if you use the 3 milligram threshold instead, the Nogales seizure would be enough to kill every West Virginian about 21 times over, not 32. There would also be a difference in lethality depending on the age, body size, and health of the individual in question.\nIn addition, Pifer added that \"is not clear whether or not the 254 pounds is pure fentanyl or fentanyl that has been already diluted for sale or distribution on the street.\" The average degree of purity would make a difference in its lethality.\nOne final point: Miller used the statistic to support the case for constructing a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the fentanyl was seized at a port of entry. A wall wouldn\u2019t prevent that type of smuggling through established checkpoints. \u00a0\nOur ruling\nMiller said, \"Just two weeks ago, Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl to kill every person in West Virginia 32 times over.\"\nIf you consider 2 milligrams to be a lethal dose -- which the Drug Enforcement Administration does -- then Miller\u2019s estimate is very close to correct. The only caveat is that differences in purity and the health and size of the potential victim can make a difference.\nThat said, there\u2019s no question that the fentanyl from the seizure, spread evenly and effectively through the population, could have killed every West Virginia resident many times over.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2019-03-06 18:47:26 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"Just two weeks ago, Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl to kill every person in West Virginia 32 times over.\"    Carol Miller U.S. House of Representatives, R-W.Va. https://twitter.com/RepCarolMiller/status/1096493224515039233   a tweet Friday, February 15, 2019 2019-02-15    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00933"}
