You do live very well. You have houses all over the place.\"\nOne such claim appears on Facebook with a viral image that shows satellite photos of four properties, and Biden\u2019s photo in the middle.\u00a0\nThe post says Biden has four homes, ranging in value from $3 million to $7.5 million \"on a $200k a year salary,\" reads the Facebook post accompanying the image.\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe Bidens own two properties, according to his campaign and several news reports about their\u00a0 estate: a primary residence in Wilmington, Del., and a vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re both shown in the image circulating on Facebook. Forbes estimated those two properties to be worth a combined $4 million last year.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other two properties in the image aren\u2019t owned by Biden. Biden sold one of them, a DuPont mansion in Delaware pictured in the top-right corner, in 1996. The fourth property, a house in McLean, Va., is a rental.\u00a0\nPolitiFact previously debunked a claim by the president\u2019s son Eric Trump, who miscaptioned the DuPont mansion as Biden\u2019s home in a tweet that questioned the former vice president\u2019s source of income. Biden bought that house for $185,000 in 1975, then sold it for $1.2 million in 1996 after major renovations.\nThe McLean, Va., home, which Biden rents, was sold to a venture capitalist for $4.25 million in 2016, The Washington Post reported.\u00a0\nThe Facebook post also makes a misleading reference to Biden\u2019s income. Biden\u2019s salary as a senator varied from $42,500 a year in 1973, when he began serving in the Senate, to $169,300 by the time he left the chamber in January 2009. As vice president for eight years, he earned up to $230,700 a year, while his wife, Jill Biden, continued to teach. In 2016, his last year in office, the couple reported an adjusted gross income of $396,456.\nBut after he left office, both Bidens wrote books, and his financial disclosure form lists dozens of speaking engagements and book-tour events that typically earned him five- and six-figure payments each. The couple, who file their taxes jointly, reported adjusted gross income of about $11 million in 2017.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nThe Facebook post claimed that Biden owns four properties, which range from values of $3 million to $7.5 million, on a salary of $200,000 a year.\u00a0\nBiden owns two of the four properties pictured. He rents a third property in the photo, and the fourth property was a mansion he renovated and sold in 1996.\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s recent earnings from book deals and speaking engagements were far larger than his salary as a government official.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18771"}
