(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe posts are not true: The holy family display has been showcased in the East Room \u2014 without interruption \u2014 since it was donated to the White House in the 1960s.\nHere\u2019s how we know.\nHistory of the White House nativity scene\nThe 47 figures of the nativity scene, known as the White House cr\u00e8che, are made of carved wood and terra cotta and were created in Naples, Italy, in the late 18th century, according to White House archives. The cr\u00e8che was donated to the White House by philanthropist Jane Engelhard in 1967, and it has been displayed every Christmas since then.\n\n\u00a0\nIn 1978, Engelhard donated 10 additional figures and funds for a new tableau, which was first displayed in 1999.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Obamas and the nativity scene\nThe rumor of the Obamas \"banning\" the famous nativity scene is seemingly brought back to life every Christmas season, despite being continuously debunked.\nThe rumor is said to have started back in 2009, during Obama\u2019s first year in office.\nThe New York Times reported that the Obama administration was considering a \"non-religious\" Christmas at the White House, which included a thought of whether to display the cr\u00e8che.\nIn the end, tradition won out, and the cr\u00e8che was placed in its usual spot.\nIn 2015, an Obama White House press\u00a0release also touted the cr\u00e8che as a \"long-standing holiday tradition.\"\n\"Donated to the White House in the 1960s, this piece has sat in the East Room for the holidays for more than 45\u00a0years, spanning nine administrations,\" the announcement says.\nIn 2016, photo evidence of the nativity scene display was captured by HGTV during a White House Christmas tour. You can see the online gallery of the tour here.\nFinally, a Trump administration news release about this year\u2019s decorations also noted the streak of the famous scene\u2019s presence in the White House, saying \"for the 51st year, the White House cr\u00e8che will also be on display.\"\nOur ruling\nSocial media posts say the Obamas banned the display of the White House\u2019s famous nativity scene throughout the years and credit First Lady Melania Trump for bringing it back.\nThis is a long-standing hoax that tends to resurface during the holidays. There was no break for the White House nativity.\nThe Obamas continued the tradition of showcasing the nativity scene in the East Room, according to previous news releases, archives, fact-checks and photo evidence. A Trump administration release also notes that the scene has been on display for over 50 years, since it was donated in 1967.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2018-12-04 22:09:30 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says the White House nativity scene was removed by the Obamas and \"is back in the White House thanks to First Lady Melania Trump.\"    Bloggers during multiple years https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=825728781092797&id=100009670471570    Friday, November 23, 2018 2018-11-23    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01220"}
