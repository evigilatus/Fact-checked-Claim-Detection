He has said the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps should be listed as a terrorist organization.\nAnd, during a speech at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on Monday, Gorka took it a step further in saying that militant groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State whose leaders are fundamentalist Sunni Muslims are less dangerous than Iran, led by fundamentalist Shiite Muslims.\n\"The far larger threat to America is, in fact, Shia jihadism \u2013 meaning Iran, and meaning the mullahs. Not the people of Iran or Persians, but the Iranian Republican regime,\" Gorka said.\n\"Why? \u2026 this is a regime which every Friday declares war on us \u2013 war and destruction. That America and Israel must be destroyed.\" He raised his voice to emphasize \"every Friday.\"\nDo Iran\u2019s leaders declare war on the United States \"every Friday,\" as Gorka suggests?\nTrump and Iran\u2019s supreme leader have certainly engaged in a war of words recently, with Trump calling a branch of the Iranian armed forces the leader\u2019s \"corrupt personal terror force and militia.\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei jabbed back, telling local media that Trump is \"foul-mouthed\" and \"pretends to be an idiot.\"\nBut PolitiFact wondered if it\u2019s possible that Iran has been at war with the United States. (We\u00a0feel like we would\u2019ve heard about that by now.)\nWe reached out to Gorka by email and Twitter to ask what he meant. He doesn\u2019t appear to elaborate on Iran\u2019s war declarations in a video of the speech posted by the Christians United for Israel Facebook group.\u00a0\nGorka responded by email after this fact check was published online.\n\"Is this meant to be a joke?\" he said.\n\"\u2018Death to America\u2019 is not a declaration of war? According to your \u2018experts?\" he continued. \"Get real experts or just stop wasting my time.\"\n\u2018Death to America\u2019\nIt\u2019s possible \u2013 even likely \u2013 that Gorka was referring to Iranian officials chanting \"Death to America\" during Friday prayers.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time PolitiFact has looked into the chants of \"Death to America\" by Iranian officials, or the country\u2019s views on America. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2015 claimed that Iran celebrates \"Death to America Day\" every year \u2013 a claim we ruled Mostly False.\nGary Sick, a scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Middle East Institute, told PolitiFact at the time that the chant \"is shouted every Friday at the weekly prayer services held across Iran.\" In fact, experts say some Iranians have been chanting \"Death to America\" in Friday prayers for decades, dating back to the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.\nAs recently as August, the Associated Press reported that members of Iranian parliament chanted it when they voted to increase spending on the country\u2019s ballistic missile program and the foreign operations of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut experts say the chant isn\u2019t meant to project the country\u2019s intentions to physically harm Americans.\nInterpreting chants\nFoad Izadi, an assistant professor in the Faculty of World Studies at the University of Tehran, told Public Radio International in 2015 that the slogan should be interpreted as \"death to American foreign policy.\" Iranians \"have problems with the American government, not the American people,\" he said.\nKevan Harris, assistant professor at UCLA and author of a book on Iranian politics, agreed: \"To me \u2013 and I've been to the \u2018revolution day\u2019 parades in Tehran as well as the Friday prayers in University of Tehran where the main political sermoning is given \u2013 it is political theater.\"\nHarris compared it to Trump\u2019s claims in August that he\u2019ll unleash \"fire and fury\" against North Korea if it continued to threaten the United States. Harris said there are \"lots of Iranian politicians\" who are moderates that favor diplomacy. But\u00a0often the statements that make American news headlines are from \"some politician in Iran with a megaphone who is trying to outcompete his rivals by saying something scandalous.\"\nAlireza Nader, senior policy analyst for the RAND Corporation, echoed Harris\u2019 view.\u00a0\n\"While hostile, this does not mean Iran is declaring war against the U.S. every Friday,\" Nader said. \"The U.S. and Iran may be rivals, but there is also a history of cooperation between the two as well, including on the nuclear issue.\"\nDeclaring war\nIt\u2019s one thing to wish ill of your political enemies. It\u2019s another to formally declare war on another country.\nHarris, the UCLA professor, says Article 110 of the Iranian constitution gives the powers of war to the supreme leader\u2019s office \u2013 which has not declared war on the U.S.\n\"In reality, Iran's Supreme National Security Council makes decisions on foreign policy -- even Foreign Minister Zarif points this out when he's asked by journalists,\" Harris said.\u00a0\nAnd PolitiFact couldn't find news reports of the supreme leader declaring war.\nCould Iran\u2019s actions be interpreted as war? Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council, notes that Iranian money and resources are involved in battles across the region.\nIn fact, the U.S. State Department has listed Iran as the top state sponsor of terrorism for many years. Iran, PBS reports, has backed \"anti-Israel groups as well as proxies that have destabilized already devastating conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\" The country has also \"continued to recruit in Afghanistan and Pakistan for Shiite militia members to fight in Syria and Iraq.\"\nBut Marashi points out none of that activity means the country has declared war on the U.S.\n\"It\u2019s fair to point out that Iran has participated in proxy wars, like in Syria for example,\" Marashi said. \"But frankly in that regard they\u2019re no different than Saudi Arabia or even the United States.\"\nOur ruling\nGorka said the Iranian regime \"declares war\" on America \"every Friday.\" The government-sanctioned prayers on Fridays sometimes include chants of \"death to America.\" Experts say those chants are rhetoric and not serious declarations of war. Iran has never formally declared war on the US even once, let alone on a weekly basis.\nWe rate Gorka\u2019s claim False.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2017-11-17 00:01:19 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Iran's regime 'every Friday declares war on us.'
