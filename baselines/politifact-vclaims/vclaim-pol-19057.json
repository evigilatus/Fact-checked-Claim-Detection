There\u2019s a difference between losing vaccines and looking for them.\nPolitico was the first news outlet to break the story that the Biden administration was trying to locate 20 million missing vaccines. After Biden was sworn in, Politico reported, his COVID-19 response team discovered that the distribution system established by the Trump administration failed to track the full route the vaccines traveled once they left the federal government\u2019s storage spaces. As a result, there was a large gap between the number of vaccines that had been sent out by the federal government and the number that had actually been administered.\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitico\u2019s reporting made clear that the Trump administration had set up the distribution infrastructure under which the 20 million missing doses had gone missing.\u00a0\n\"That\u2019s a dilemma that predated the Biden team\u2019s arrival,\" Politico noted.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RFAngle article that Fournier linked to in his tweet is critical of Biden but does not directly claim that the Biden team lost the vaccines. \"Biden administration cannot find 20 million vaccine doses,\" reads the headline.\u00a0\nDaniel Baldwin, the author of the RFAngle article, told PolitiFact that he based his piece on the Politico report.\u00a0\nWe reached out to Fournier and asked for evidence to back up his claim. In response to our email, Mark Chase at RFAngle responded with a link to the Politico article and a NY Post article that drew on Politico\u2019s reporting. When PolitiFact pointed to the language in the Politico article that contradicts Fournier\u2019s claim, Chase told us that RFAngle had corrected its piece to clarify that the loss of the doses predated the Biden administration.\n\"The vaccines were dispatched by the federal government to state governments prior to President Biden taking office. The Biden Administration is making efforts to locate them,\" the correction reads.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nRyan Fournier claimed that \"the Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\"\nThe Biden administration didn\u2019t lose those doses. The Trump administration set up the distribution infrastructure under which these vaccines went missing.\u00a0\nThe article that Fournier linked to as evidence has been corrected to include this information.\nFournier\u2019s claim is False.\u00a0\u200b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19057"}
