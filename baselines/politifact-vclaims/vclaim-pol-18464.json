Most pro Trump. True?\"\nNot true.\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As we were fact-checking the claim, Facebook removed the group on the grounds that it was delegitimizing the election process and in some cases calling for violence.\nOutside of this Facebook post, we have seen no reports of \"thousands\" of military ballots being found dumped in the trash in Wisconsin.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

State election officials previously told us that the City of Milwaukee was still counting absentee ballots around 3 a.m. after Election Day, but that didn\u2019t mean those ballots were found or appeared at that time.\nThere\u2019s no evidence that thousands of military ballots were found in the trash in Wisconsin and election officials refuted the claim.\nWe rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18464"}
