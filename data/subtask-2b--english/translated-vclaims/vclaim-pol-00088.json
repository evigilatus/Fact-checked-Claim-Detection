It appears from the artificial tweet that Luinsky, a central figure in the isolation of President Bill Clinton in 1999 for obstruction of justice and sworn lies, made a proposed sexual comment involving Trump, oral sex, and her interest in seeing Trump be separated from him. The murder of Clinton was the result of a sexual harassment case, where Lewinsky, who was then an intern at the White House, became famously involved after an independent council had investigated sexual confrontations between Lewinsky and Clinton. The viral image in question shows the real photo and handle of Lewinsky on Twitter. It appears that she wrote a tweet at 6:06 p.m. on October 3, with 1,610 tweets and over 18,000 loves, which says, \"I'm willing to take one for the Cic team and give Trump a b*** in the Oval Office. Apparently, this is the only thing that can convince Republicans to accuse.\" The picture was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, this isn't a real tweet written by Monica Lewinsky. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" A visit to Instagram's file shows Loinsky's tweet and several other fabricated tweets and other memes. The same person on Twitter tells people to follow her on Instagram for \"original memes.\" In 2018, the user of Associated Press admitted that he was responsible for making a false tweet made to look like it came from President Barack Obama &apos; s verified account. Polyte Fact continued with @Electoroting but did not receive an immediate response. There is no sign of tweeting on the Luynsky Data Page on Twitter. She was tweeted several times in October 3, but none of them mentioned isolation or anything referring to sex. We also looked at the Twitter website @MonicaLewinsky in the All My Twits database, which gathers users on Twitter on a single web page, and we were unable to find anything from Lewinsky in October 3 - as the screen footage shows - that refers to dismissal, trumps or oral sex. Another red flag shows that tweeting is fabricated: an advanced Twitter search did not produce its key words with results (almost). For the viral tweet that is supposed to have collected thousands of tweets and loved ones, only one tweet with similar words appeared on the podium from a user who is not Lewinsky. We contacted Lewinsky for comment, but we haven't answered it yet. We know enough, though, to evaluate these fake tweet pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00088"}
