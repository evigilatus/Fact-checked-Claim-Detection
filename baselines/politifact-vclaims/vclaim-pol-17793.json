It\u2019s attributed to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and ends with an uncharacteristic scolding.\u00a0\n\"For those in our society who suggest that people being cautious are cowards, for people who refuse to take even the simplest of precautions to protect themselves and those around them, I want to ask, without hyperbole and in all sincerity: How dare you?\" the statement says. It goes on to encourage doing everything we can to mitigate the risk of exposure to the coronavirus, to flatten the curve and avoid unnecessary suffering and death.\u00a0\n\"I reject the notion that it\u2019s \u2018just a virus\u2019 and we\u2019ll all get it eventually,\" the post concludes. \"What a careless, lazy heartless stance.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
