The founder of the Hovington Post wrote: \"Because 20% of young adults use their devices during sex. Get ready for \"Dear, I'm checking the number of calories we burn on the monitor!\" We don't know if the enigmatic technology will mix with a few moments - if anything - to wear, but the statistical reference to smartphones and sex raised the eyebrows of one of our fans, journalist Josh Barrow of The New York Times, who tweeted the request to check the facts. We asked Hofington where it came from, and she referred to an article in the Huffington Post about a year ago. In fact, Jomyo, a company operating with a mobile credit system and a credit card payment system, commissioned a non-indiscriminate online survey of the consumer's mobile habits. The result was that 9% of adults say they used a smart phone during sex. For those aged 18 to 34, the percentage rises to 20 per cent. (Havengton said use, while the study asked \"I've used.\") We asked Jenny Davis to contact the media for a recon if there were any other details. In particular, we wanted to know what people do with their phones at times when their attention may be concentrated elsewhere. \"That's the question everyone's asking,\" said Davis. \"The survey didn't go any further. I always thought a follow-up study would be interesting. Do they play music? Do they take pictures?\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 January 12, 2012, or looking for recipes, who knows? We should note that this word of caution is included in the online polling report. \"This online survey is not based on a probable sample and therefore no estimate of the theoretical error in sampling can be calculated.\" This is an important distinction for anyone who knows anything about voting, meaning that the results should not be considered scientific or all of them useful. Our referee Hofington said that 20% of young adults use mobile devices during sex. This, for the most part, accurately reflects the results of a non-scientific online survey. While the opinion poll itself is questionable, there is no better information available to contradict the opinion poll on the Huffington allegation. Maybe the new apple clock will have an app for that one day. We're mostly assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07328"}
