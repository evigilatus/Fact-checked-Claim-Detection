It didn\u2019t feel right to have to make that decision.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShoemaker\u2019s father Scott Shoemaker posted a message on Facebook March 16:\n\"My son was suspended for not leaving the room to either join a demonstration or reporting to the commons. He was uncomfortable going to either location as he thought that going outside would most likely be politicizing a horrific event which he wanted no part of, but staying inside would make him look disrespectful or insensitive to 17 innocent victims if it turned out to be more of a memorial service.\n\"This had nothing to do with his own political beliefs, but with politics in school in general. Students should not have been forced to leave their classrooms, choose a side, and be politically divided. He got support from students on both sides of the political aisle after returning today, but he felt there were other students and staff angry with him for taking this position.\"\nFox News reported a statement from the school: \"As a district, we are required to supervise students during the school day. We do not leave students unattended in classrooms. .... This is the same practice our district implements when students opt out of other school programs or activities. We provide an alternative, supervised location.\"\nWe found the school\u2019s full statement on its website, which stated that no students were forced to participate in the walkout.\n\"In fact, student participation overall was well under 50 percent of the student population. The majority of students were comfortable and confident in not participating in these gatherings. Students who chose not to participate were provided safe, supervised alternatives in all three high schools. No one was forced or coerced to participate. No one was disciplined for not participating. Our school culture respects the rights of all students. We strive to provide a safe environment for all students, but we do expect students to follow directions and comply with staff requests. This is required to maintain an orderly school environment.\"\nSchool spokeswoman Stacie Raterman told PolitiFact that students opting not to attend the walkout were able to go to supervised study halls in different classrooms and the commons area. She said she couldn\u2019t comment on any individual student\u2019s discipline due to federal privacy laws but said about a dozen students at Davidson were suspended after attending the memorial gathering but not returning to class.\nA Fox News network spokeswoman did not have any additional comment.\nOur ruling\nMany online headlines said, \"Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day.\"\nThe headline in and of itself could lead viewers to reach a misleading conclusion that the student was suspended for simply opting out of the walkout. But the story states that he was suspended because he didn\u2019t take the alternative the school district offered, which was to attend a supervised study hall instead.\nThe school said that less than half of the students participated in the walk out and that no one was disciplined for opting out of it, but they had to remain in a place supervised by staff.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ca28f23a-ee20-4174-ad2a-f05dd64ca2b5", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02256"}
