None of this is occurring in the House.\u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 24, 2019 \nWe looked into the same \"due process\" claim when it showed up in a White House letter indicating that Trump would not be cooperating with the inquiry. At the time, constitutional scholars told us that complaint lacks legal footing.\u00a0\nThe House impeaches, the Senate holds the trial\nIn his resolution, Graham wrote that due process for Trump would mean \"the right to confront your accuser, call witnesses on your behalf, and challenge the accusations against you.\"\u00a0\nGraham spokesman Kevin Bishop pointed to a presentation Graham showed during a press conference\u00a0listing\u00a0rights Graham said President Bill Clinton had when he was impeached, such as the right to have counsel at hearings and the right to challenge evidence, among others. (The House Judiciary Committee did hear testimony from Clinton\u2019s White House counsel, but there\u2019s no constitutional provision requiring it to do so.)\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaks about his resolution during a news conference\u00a0in Washington on Oct. 24, 2019.\u00a0(AP/Applewhite)\u200b\nBut when we checked out the White House\u2019s letter, Vanderbilt University law professor Suzanna Sherry told us \"there is nothing that requires Congress to give the president any of the opportunities\" that Graham, like the White House attorney before him, described.\nIf such rights apply at all, they would be granted to Trump during the trial phase, which the Constitution says takes place in the Senate. The House\u2019s job is to determine whether there\u2019s enough evidence to show that the president committed an impeachable offense.\nSherry told us that \"an impeachment investigation is analogous to a criminal investigation or inquiry by the police, prosecutor or grand jury\" and that \"the accused has none of the rights\" that White House counsel Pat Cipollone listed in the White House\u2019s letter and Graham listed in his resolution.\n\"In particular, neither the accused nor his or her lawyer are present at a grand jury hearing, nor is the accused permitted to present witnesses or other evidence or see a transcript,\" she said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is only after charges have been filed and the case has reached the trial stage that criminal defendants have the right to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, have access to evidence, and have counsel present,\" said former federal prosecutor and Stanford Law professor David Sklansky, adding that the due process complaint is \"not a good argument.\"\n\"The role of the House of Representatives in an impeachment proceeding is to investigate and charge, not to try,\" he said. \"The trial comes later, in the Senate.\"\nEven in the Senate, however, it\u2019s not clear that impeachment proceedings require due process protections, because conviction results only in removal from office, experts said.\nWriting for Reason, Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said due process rights are protected in \"situations where an individual stands to lose her \u2018life, liberty, or property,\u2019 none of which is at risk here.\"\n\"To suggest that due process requires that a president facing only loss of office get more rights at the accusatory stage than a criminal defendant facing loss of liberty or even life is not only constitutionally unsupportable, but ludicrous,\" said Frank O. Bowman III, professor of law at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on impeachment.\nThe Constitution lets the House set the rules\nGraham\u2019s resolution criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s handling of the impeachment inquiry and the fact that she has not held a formal vote to authorize the inquiry.\nThe Constitution says that the House \"shall have the sole Power of Impeachment\" and the Senate \"shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.\"\nIn the past, the full House has authorized impeachment inquiries, and then the House Judiciary Committee has taken the lead in conducting the investigations, holding hearings on proposed articles of impeachment, and voting on whether to approve them. The final vote on impeachment is by the full House before it moves to Senate for trial.\nPelosi has not held a vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry (a majority say they approve of an inquiry), but instead instructed three committees \u2014 Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs \u2014 to carry out an investigation that Judiciary will use to draft any articles of impeachment. While her process has been different, historians told us Pelosi does not need to hold a full House vote.\nIn the only Supreme Court case where due process issues were raised \u2014 a 1993 ruling on the Senate impeachment trial of Judge Walter Nixon \u2014 the court found that the Senate\u2019s process was \"nonjusticiable,\" which Bowman said means \"a matter not to be resolved by the courts.\"\u00a0\nBut a federal judge in Washington on Oct. 25 called the idea that a full House vote is required to initiate impeachment proceedings \"fatally flawed.\" In a 75-page district court opinion, Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell wrote, \"Even in cases of presidential impeachment, a House resolution has never, in fact, been required to begin an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\"All that matters for legitimacy for the House proceedings is to follow the rules of the House as they currently stand and the Constitution,\" said Michael Gerhardt, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina in Chapel-Hill.\nAs the House moves forward, Pelosi could elect to let Trump\u2019s lawyers to participate. Sklansky told us that former President Richard Nixon\u2019s lawyer was allowed to question witnesses called by the House Judiciary Committee and to recommend other witnesses to be called, and that Clinton\u2019s lawyers were also permitted to call and question witnesses called by the committee.\nAt the end of the day, the Constitution gives the House the right to decide how to proceed.\nOur ruling\nIn the resolution, Graham wrote that House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry are \"denying President Trump basic fairness and due process accorded every American.\"\nConstitutional scholars said due process rights are not necessarily guaranteed to a president during an impeachment inquiry. If they were, they would be granted during the Senate trial, not the House\u2019s evidence-gathering process.\nWe rate this statement False.\nCORRECTION:\u00a0This fact-check has been updated to include the House Oversight Committee among the congressional committees leading the investigations as part of the House impeachment inquiry.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00006"}
