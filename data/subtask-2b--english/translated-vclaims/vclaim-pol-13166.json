We've written about bills before. The House of Representatives version, HB 1355, was passed 79-37 on 21 April 2011, while Senate Bill SB 2086, is awaiting voting. Among many different provisions, draft laws no longer allow voters who have moved or changed their family name to update their information in elections held on election day. Instead, these voters are required to submit provisional ballots which will be reviewed after the elections. The Republicans say it's a way to eliminate potential voter fraud. But Democrats like Nelson say it's a way to suppress the voices of people who are more likely to change their names (women) and people who are more likely to move frequently (youth and college students). At a press conference with Democratic State Legislators on May 2, Bay News 9 and Central Florida 13, Reporter Troy Kinsey asked Nelson what was wrong with people having to vote for their time. \"Look at history,\" Nelson replied. \"Look at the provisional ballot papers in 2008. Fifty-five percent of them are offended. Fifty-five percent of the people who cast provisional votes in the last presidential election -- their vote wasn't counted.\" We turned to statistics to see in Nelson he was right. The results of the provisional ballots held during the presidential elections held in autumn 2008 in all 50 states have been studied by the Pew State Centre, which is widely regarded as a non-partisan source. They found that there was a wide variation in Florida between the provinces as to the percentage of provisional votes allowed by local polling boards, as well as why those votes that were not counted were ultimately not allowed. More than 80 per cent of the provisional votes cast in the province of Duval were counted, while in the province of Hillsboro less than 60 per cent were counted. In South Florida, 34 per cent of the provisional ballot papers were counted in Miami-Dade. In Broward County, only about 6 percent of the provisional ballots were eventually counted in the results, and Pew was found. \"The precise reasons for these differences within Florida are unclear, but the reasons that rejected these ballots give a slightly more detailed picture,\" Pyo wrote. \"In Broward County, 100% of the rejected provisional votes were not counted because they were cast by unregistered voters in the state. In Hillsboro province, more than 40 per cent of the rejected provisional votes were rejected for having been cast in the wrong area. The provinces of Duval and Miami-Dade have seen large numbers of rejected provisional votes because the eligibility of voters cannot be established.\" In total, Pyo reported that 35,635 voters from Florida submitted provisional ballots in the autumn 2008 elections (42 per cent of a total of 8.4 million voters voted for the presidency). Of the 35,635 ballot papers submitted, 17,314 were counted and 18,321 were not counted. To match this with Nelson &apos; s claim, this means 51.4 per cent of the provisional ballots submitted were not counted for one reason or another. We checked Pew's numbers with the State Department and found a slight contradiction. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 17,312 votes were counted - two fewer votes than Pew - but were not sufficient to change the percentage of those who submitted provisional ballots but did not count them. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Chris Kate also provided us with provisional polling statistics from the 2010 general elections. It should be noted that the percentage of temporary votes ultimately reduced has been halved compared to 2008. In the autumn 2010 elections, the local boards of inquiry considered 13,181 temporary ballots. It ended with 9,790 votes and 3,391 ballots - or 25.7 per cent of the total number of provisional ballots - being cast. Nelson said that \"55 per cent of the people who cast temporary votes (in Florida) in the last presidential election - their vote did not count.\" There are two minor explanations: Nelson is slightly higher in terms of the percentage claim, and he does not note that the percentage of provisional votes improved significantly in 2010. We're mostly assessing this claim right. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 January 12, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13166"}
