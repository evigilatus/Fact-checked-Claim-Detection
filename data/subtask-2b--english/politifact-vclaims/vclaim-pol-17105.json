Kamala Harris called President Donald Trump a \"drug pusher\" for promoting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.\u00a0\nHydroxychloroquine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat or prevent malaria and to treat autoimmune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. As we\u2019ve previously reported, the drug is not a cure for COVID-19, and research on whether it could provide relief from symptoms of the disease is inconclusive. In July, the FDA released a summary of safety issues related to using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients.\nOn Aug. 12, the day after presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden named Harris as his running mate, Paul Sperry, the former Washington bureau chief for Investor\u2019s Business Daily, tweeted what looked like a bombshell.\u00a0\n\"DEVELOPING,\" it said. \"Kamala\u2019s sister takes hydroxychloroquine.\"\nWe reached out to Sperry about the tweet but did not immediately hear back.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Masks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFact is, this story has already, well, developed. Maya Harris, Kamala Harris\u2019 sister, broke the news exactly four months earlier.\u00a0\n\"I have lupus,\" Maya Harris tweeted on April 12, sharing an article she had written for the Atlantic. \"I haven\u2019t spoken publicly about it before now. But then coronavirus hit, killing black people at alarming rates & Trump unnecessarily put lupus patients\u2014disproportionately black women\u2014at higher risk.\"\nIn the story, Maya Harris writes: \"Not long ago, Donald Trump started talking and tweeting about hydroxychloroquine, which I have taken for most of my adult life, as if it were a miracle drug\u2014a \u2018game changer\u2019 for treating COVID-19, the president insists. Immediately, thousands of people began hoarding it, causing shortages that have resulted in lupus patients\u2014and their doctors\u2014struggling to get the supply they need.\"\nSperry\u2019s tweet is technically accurate: Maya Harris does take the drug. But, as many people pointed out in their replies to the tweet, it\u2019s wrongly cast as if this is breaking news. Other comments make clear that at least some people are reading an unsaid suggestion: that she takes it to treat or prevent COVID-19.\u00a0\nShe uses the drug for lupus.\u00a0\nWe rate this tweet Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17105"}
