Did you mention that he has (a) a criminal record and has no legal weapon? Also, he was not a member of @NRA. @BetoORourke, is it still Trump's fault?\" This post, which was published on Facebook on 3 September, was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The tweet is wrong: It is not true that the suspect in the shooting of Odessa had a sticker on his truck that supports Oork. It's a conspiracy theory, which, according to the Washington Post, has been promoted as an alternative to the Trump Anthony Schaffer campaign. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: 11 January 2021 \"Shafer, who has promoted unfounded allegations of 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and has engaged with the military and the United States intelligence community about his allegations of intelligence failure prior to the 11 September 2001 attacks.\" \"In one article, he said that the gunman was a supporter of Orok, the marking of democracy, and retweeting an article from an account with @soemo54 and the name 'Sue More'.\" That tweet was similar to that on Facebook, and Shafer stood next to his own tweet, saying, \"That's not what I saw from people\" when he was informed that his claim was actually unfounded, according to the story. The Post reported that the Twitter account, which appears to have \"neglect the conspiracy theory about Aurourke,\" \"his owner knows he's a 72-year-old retiree and lives in Misa, Ares.\" A spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety told the newspaper that there is nothing to suggest that the suspected shooter is connected to Oork. One of the founders of a company called Vincent, which uses artificial intelligence to track misleading information, said the article \"Looks to have been expanded mainly by the boot accounts,\" says the story. The director of the Orok campaign, Jane O'Malley Dillon, posted on Twitter the story of the Washington Post on September 3, and wrote: \"This weekend, the right-wing robot network published a completely false rumor that the shooter Odessa had a sticker on his car. It was a car, not a truck, the suspected shooter was driving when he was stopped by state soldiers before the shooting rush - a gold-colored passenger car. We're assessing this wrong Facebook post.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00161"}
