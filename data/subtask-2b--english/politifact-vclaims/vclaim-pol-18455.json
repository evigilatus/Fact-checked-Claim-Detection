After residents vote, the site says, the results are reviewed by the Board of Canvassers in each city, township and county. The canvassers certify the election results from their jurisdictions and a four-member Board of State Canvassers certifies the results of all statewide offices, district offices that cross county lines and statewide ballot proposals.\u00a0\nEach Board of Canvassers includes two Republicans and two Democrats. Once all the canvassers have met, the results are considered final.\u00a0\nWe rate the claim that Whitmer said she wouldn\u2019t certify the state\u2019s election results False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18455"}
