Chris Coons, D-Del.\n\"BREAKING: The daughter of Sen. Coons (D-DE), along with 7 other underaged girls are featured on Hunter\u2019s laptop! - Breitbart News,\" the post says.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim has also made its way to TikTok and YouTube.\nSince the New York Post published a story Oct. 14 in which it claimed to have information from a computer hard drive owned by Hunter Biden, similar unproven attacks against him have swirled on social media. So we took a closer look at this claim.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nThere is no evidence that a computer hard drive previously belonging to Hunter Biden contains illicit images of Coons\u2019 teenage daughter. The claim comes from a U.S. Senate candidate who has previously shared posts related to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory about child sex trafficking.\nOn Oct. 24, Lauren Witzke, a Republican who\u2019s running against Coons to represent Delaware in the Senate, tweeted an audio clip from an interview with Breitbart News. The post has been shared more than 8,700 times and amplified by conservative outlets like the Gateway Pundit.\nDuring the interview, Witzke made a variety of accusations against Joe Biden, including that he is \"owned by China.\" While discussing Hunter Biden\u2019s purported laptop, she said: \"Chris Coons'\u00a0daughter, in addition to seven other underage girls, are also featured on the laptop.\"\nBreitbart did not independently report this as news, as the Facebook posts make it seem.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoons is one of Joe Biden\u2019s biggest supporters in Washington, and his daughter has previously been the subject of disinformation that falsely claims Biden is a pedophile. One often-used photo shows Biden touching her arm as he leans in to whisper something.\nIn her interview with Breitbart, Witzke cited \"sources close to and that have deep knowledge in the investigation.\" We reached out to her for evidence to substantiate her comments, but she did not offer any. We haven\u2019t heard back from the Biden campaign.\nHer comments play into QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that claims President Donald Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of Democratic, Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles. Before winning Delaware\u2019s Republican primary in September, Witzke tried to distance herself from QAnon. But Witzke has been photographed wearing a T-shirt sporting a giant \"Q\" and tweeted a slogan used by its supporters.\nThere is no publicly available evidence to support Witzke\u2019s claim \u2014 and neither Breitbart nor the New York Post have reported such a finding.\nRELATED: Fact-checking claims about Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, and China\nThe New York Post\u2019s story about Hunter Biden relies on information from a computer hard drive that the tabloid said it received from Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. The computer was supposedly left unclaimed at a Delaware computer shop, the owner of which called the FBI and a Giuliani associate after noticing a sticker for the Beau Biden Foundation on the laptop. We are not able to verify the emails cited in the Post\u2019s article, which claims Hunter Biden set up a meeting between his father and a Ukrainian businessman.\nBut the story does not establish that such a meeting ever took place, and the Post did not report that Hunter Biden possessed images of minors. The FBI declined to comment for a previous fact-check due to its practice of \"neither confirming nor denying the existence of an investigation.\" Giuliani also hasn\u2019t returned our messages about the hard drive. No other news organizations have seen or corroborated the data supposedly on the laptop.\u00a0\nBecause of that, we can\u2019t say for certain what is or isn\u2019t on the hard drive at the center of the New York Post\u2019s story.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook posts say, \"The daughter of Sen. Coons (D-DE), along with 7 other underaged girls are featured on Hunter's laptop!\" The posts are attributed to Breitbart, but the conservative news and opinion site did not publish such an allegation. A U.S. Senate candidate, running against Coons, repeated this claim in an interview with Breitbart. The candidate offered no evidence to back up her claim about illicit material on a computer hard drive connected to Hunter Biden.\nWe rate the unproven claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18777"}
