On the press meeting, guest Chuck Todd played a section of Sanders joking on the campaign path that her speeches to Goldman Sachs must be written in Shakespeare's prose. \"I'm the only candidate in the primary Democratic Party, or indeed on either side, who funded Wall Street and actually hedge fund managers running advertising against,\" replied. \"So I find this, again, kind of, you know, indirect way to raise questions about my record.\" Is it true that Clinton is the only target of Wall Street in this cycle? The Clinton campaign referred us to the verification of our own reality of the announcement of the attack sponsored by the PAC Precautionary Fund, Future45. While this supports Clinton &apos; s view that the financial sector spent money on it, it does not support the idea that Wall Street only attacked her. We consulted Robert Maguire from the Center for Responsive Policy, Nancy, and they were named from the political television archive Ad. Their statements show that Clinton &apos; s statement is inaccurate. The problem with its claim is that Wall Street funders and hedge fund managers are not a single group. Some have even expressed their support for Clinton and Sanders, and their contributions have been dispersed among republican and democratic groups. While Clinton was the target of more offensive advertising than Sanders, more money was spent from the financial industry on each of the remaining Republicans. In fact, the most funded candidate from Wall Street is actually Donald Trump. The attacks against Clinton come primarily from three provincial groups. In addition to the announcement we've verified, Future 45 has done six more against Clinton. The contributions from Wall Street represent half of the group &apos; s funding. The American crossroads, founded by Carl Ruff, sponsored eight declarations against Clinton and the American-affiliated Mate Romney Renaissance Group, 10 of which also targeted Sanders. According to the Centre for Responsive Policy, the financial industry is responsible for about half of all contributions to the Ruf Group and two thirds to the Romney Group. The future is 45 too. I sponsored an announcement against Sanders. The financial sector finances 56 per cent of the ESA Fund, a major conservative company, which broadcast a single declaration against Sanders in Iowa. Last summer, Jill Ford, a supporter of Martin O'Malley Super BC, sought out Sanders' record of weapons. Five of her donations come from Wall Street. One third of its voluntary contributions from the financial sector were seized by the European Union-affiliated Clinton. It broadcast 11 advertisements against Trump and spent more than $61,000 targeting the Republican contestant. (Modern: Action for the Priorities of the United States of America stated that the 11 videos it produced appeared only on the Internet. However, this is diminishing compared to the amount of money and his Republican colleagues who devoted airtime to beating him. The conservative groups have spent more than $28 million against Trump. Our principles programme, launched by a former assistant to Romney, spent more than $14 million on Trump and sponsored at least 27 declarations attacking him. One third of the group's funding comes from Wall Street. Marco Rubio, affiliated with it, broadcast seven anti-TROMP declarations and received about 40 per cent of its financing from the financial sector. Rubio himself was the subject of 11 offensive announcements by the Ted Cruz Society to keep the first superhero promise (the mailbox manager Robert Mercer was responsible for $11 million of his total contribution of $11,036,250), and 12 declarations by the Bush pocket party entitled to rise, half of which was funded by Wall Street. These are the 10 groups with the largest share of Wal Street's contributions and opposition opponents, collected with Maguire Watsman's help: Wall Street's name* opposition announcements** kept the first promise 99.7 per cent against Rubio, 7 against Trump, 6 against Clinton America 68.2 per cent against Clinton, and 2 against Sanders Super P.B.C. checking the facts L.

Some of these declarations are clear ones that attack a candidate, while others compare a preferred candidate against others. As you will notice, the announcement of the attack largely survived Sanders who pours on Wall Street every day. This is because the financial sector takes Clinton seriously and Saunders less, according to John J. Geir, Professor of Political Science at Vanderbilt University, who wrote the book Defending Ignorance: Publicizing the Attack in Presidential Campaigns. Saunders has an important message that responds to many. \"But that's not enough to win the nomination,\" said Jer. \"Why do you spend money that will have little return on investment?\" Our rule, Clinton, said, \"I am the only candidate in the EDP, or indeed on either side, who finance Wall Street and hedge fund managers are actually running advertisements against.\" Wall Street funders and hedge fund managers make announcements against Clinton. However, it is unreasonable to say that she is the only one attacked by people associated with the financial sector. The financial sector has contributed on both sides of the corridor, including the Clinton Special Campaign. The Wall Street-supported groups have carried out offensive announcements against almost every candidate.
