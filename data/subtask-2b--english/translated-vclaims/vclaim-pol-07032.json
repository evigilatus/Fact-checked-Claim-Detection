The Daily Caller, an online publication consistent with the governors, published a story entitled \"Bumbshill MEMO: Jean Shahin Conspired with the inner White House on IRS targeting a scandal.\" The story was published at 9:36 p.m. the night before the election. The story accuses Shaheen of being \"mainly involved in a conspiracy with Louis Lerner and President Barack Obama, who is politically appointed to the Tax Service to lead a programme of harassment against conservative non-profit groups during the 2012 elections. The night before election day is an unusually late moment for a \"missile\" to appear in the Senate contest. But the readers asked Polyte Fact to take a look, even if our analysis was well published on election day. So we did. Early in the election cycle, the President of the Republican Party in New Hampshire, Jennifer Horn, said that Shahin \"got the idea of using the tax authority to target American citizens for their political opinions. In our examination of the facts published on 23 October 2013, we concluded that what Shahin did in fact \"backward\" is the DISCLOSE Act, which requires non-profit groups to exchange information about their contributions to the electoral campaign. We are determined that it is difficult to suggest that Shaheen prefers to pursue citizens for their \"political views,\" so we have estimated Horn's statement to be often wrong. The story of Tuesday is slightly different because it accuses Shaheen of being part of a \"group\" of harassment against conservative groups. As evidence that the story cited \"letters obtained exclusively by the daily caller\" These letters were the result of a request for freedom of information made on 9 October 2014, according to the documents submitted to Polyte Fact New Hampshire. Of the nine documents submitted, five are reprinting letters from Shahin and six other members of the Democratic Senate to Douglas Schulman, Commissioner of the Tax Service, requesting the Tax Administration to investigate any of the non-profit organizations that are not taxed while \"focusing on federal electoral activities.\" The remaining four pages are responses to that request. In its responses, the Tax Service did not commit to making any changes. \"To ensure that the organizations provided for in section 501 (c) (4) meet the tax exemption requirements under the Internal Revenue Act, the Internal Tax Service has ongoing programmes reviewing the activities of organizations seeking recognition of the tax exemption of the Internal Tax Service.\" Steve T. Miller, Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement, wrote in his reply of 26 April 2012. Subsequently, he added, \"The Tax Service is aware of the public interest in this matter. These regulations have been in force since 1959. We will consider the proposed changes in this area as we work with the Office of the Senior Adviser of the Tax Service and the Tax Policy Office of the Treasury Department.\" The letters themselves are not confidential. The first, on February 16, 2012, was signed by Seans. Chuck Schommer (D-NY), Al Franken (D-Minn), Jeff Merkel (D-Ore), Jean Shahin (D-NH), Tom Odal (D-N.M), Michael Bennet (D-Colo) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). It has been available to the general public for more than a year; Shaheen's signature is placed on the third page. On February 5, 2021, Louis Jacobson published the second letter signed by the same seven senators, dated March 9, 2012, which was even the subject of a press release by Schommer. :: Letter dated 16 February 2012 requesting the Tax Administration to review its supervision of 501 (c) (4) organizations involved in the policy. (The name refers to a section of the Tax Code.) The Internal Revenue Act grants tax exemption status to non-profit organizations that promote \"social welfare.\" But Shaheen's message is that some groups abuse tax-exempt privileges by calling themselves welfare organizations while spending most of their money on influencing politics. The letter states that the law provides that \"social welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or interference in political campaigns on behalf of or against any candidate for political office.\" The letter first emerged in 2013 after the publication of a report by the Inspector General of the Tax Administration of the Treasury, which concluded that the Internal Tax Service had improperly targeted conservative groups. Some Republicans cited the letter as evidence that Democrats were responsible for these acts. At the same time, the letter to the Commissioner of the International Tax Service dated 9 March 2012 encouraged the Tax Authority to change the way it deals with non-profit organizations that spend money on politics and proposed three changes, including that organizations document the exact percentage of their funds going to social welfare. We do not see how these letters support the basic pillars of the claim -- that Shahin was \"involved in a conspiracy,\" that this conspiracy involved Lerner and other Obama appointees, or that the issue is \"the harassment programme against conservative non-profit groups.\" The ninth new Webster dictionary defines this type of \"dangerous\" as \"a secret plan to bring about an evil or usually illegal end.\" The letters were not confidential, and although we would not take a stand on whether their efforts were \"bad,\" they were clearly wanted by the IRS to abide by the law, not breach it. In addition, there is no reference to Luis Lerner - the central figure in the debate - and there is no clear connection to anyone appointed by Obama as a politician other than Sholman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2008. As for the \"program of harassment against conservative non-profit groups,\" the letters do not encourage a party or ideological focus on the effort. It refers to 501 (c) (4) non-profit organizations in general, not just conservative groups. The Daily Caller did not respond to our request for comment. We were accused by the \"The Daily Caller\" that Shahin \"was mainly involved in a conspiracy with Louis Lerner and President Barack Obama, who was politically appointed to the Tax Service to lead a programme to harass conservative non-profit groups during the 2012 elections. Shahin and six other members of the Democratic Senate have sent letters relating extensively to the question of auditing the activities of non-profit groups. Their concern was that some groups abused tax-exempt privileges by calling themselves welfare organizations while spending most of their money on influencing politics. Daley Caller's article insinuating beyond the evidence. The letters were not confidential, Blair or other Obama appointees were not cited, and no provincial groups were singled out. We're assessing the allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07032"}
