He faces Clackamas County Commission chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county commissioner Paul Savas and state Rep. Dave Hunt in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nSnubbing PERS is a nice symbolic pledge for someone running on a platform of limited government. It also won\u2019t hurt Ludlow, who is 63 years old, as much as it would someone who is further away from retirement.\n\nBut the next part of Ludlow\u2019s claim really caught our attention. In a Facebook post dated March 30, he wrote, \"I am happy to decline PERS so that the County can save over $30,000 per year that would have been paid on my behalf.\" (The post was changed Tuesday; we\u2019ll explain below.)\n\nThat sounded like a lot of money saved, given that a county commissioner\u2019s annual salary is $81,000. We checked it out. In doing so, Ludlow clarified to PolitiFact Oregon and on Facebook that by declining PERS, \"the County can save over $68,000 over a four year term that would have been paid on my behalf.\"\n\nWe asked Ludlow why he had claimed $30,000 in savings a year, and now $68,000 over four years. He said it\u2019s hard getting solid numbers from the Public Employees Retirement System. \"I am now satisfied that the last numbers quoted by me are the correct numbers,\" he wrote us.\n\nHmmm. We don\u2019t think politicians, aspiring or otherwise, should claim savings without evidence. That\u2019s careless.\n\nBut let\u2019s get back to how much county taxpayers will save should Ludlow decline retirement benefits. The county position pays $80,868 a year\n\nThis is how public retirement payments work: Every employer pays a \"contribution rate,\" depending on the type of employer and type of employee. The rates are set in advance. In the case of Clackamas County, the employer contribution rate is 11.99 percent for general service workers for the 2011-13 budget period.\n\nThe 11.99 percent includes 6.13 percent that the employer puts in for a member\u2019s retirement, plus 5.86 percent to cover the system\u2019s \"unfunded actuarial liability,\" or the money needed to pay for current and future retirees. In addition, the county pays -- or \"picks up\" -- the 6 percent the employee is required to contribute on his or her behalf.\n\nThat adds up to $14,500 a year. But David Crosley, a spokesman for PERS, said the actual amount of money saved -- or avoided -- should Ludlow decline is closer to $9,800 a year, or a little more than $39,000 over four years.\n\nThat\u2019s because the county needs to kick in for unfunded actuarial liability anyway, regardless of whether Ludlow declines PERS for himself. \"That amount gets spread over fewer people,\" Crosley said. \"They\u2019re not saving that in the long term.\"\n\nBut let\u2019s look at this from the county\u2019s perspective, which is what Ludlow relies on. Marc Gonzales, the county\u2019s finance director, confirmed the county budgets about $17,247 a year per commissioner for retirement-related costs.\n\nWhy is it higher? In part, because the county calculates the figure with longer-term employees in mind, and they have higher retirement costs. Tim Heider, a spokesman for Clackamas County, wrote in an email that \"the county would not incur any PERS cost for an employee who declines enrollment.\"\n\nSo we\u2019ve gone from $30,000 a year to roughly $17,000 a year to $9,800 a year. It\u2019s undeniable that Ludlow will save taxpayers money by declining to join PERS, should he win. But he\u2019s off on how much, and whether it would have been paid on his behalf.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not the $30,000 a year he originally claimed. It may be $17,000 as he now claims, but that\u2019s because the county has budgeted generously. (Ludlow as a new member will not cost taxpayers as much as employees who have been in the system for a long time.) The Public Employees Retirement System estimates money that would have gone to him is closer to $10,000 a year.\n\nLudlow\u2019s revised statement is partially true but missing information. We rate it Half True\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKathleen Falk\n\n\nstated on April 9, 2012 in a television ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Together we added more jobs than any other area\" while I was Dane County executive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Dave Umhoefer \u2022 April 13, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11107"}
