But, President Barack Obama says Romney\u2019s rate would be far lower under a plan proposed by the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s new running mate.\n\nObama took aim at Romney and his running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, last week in a speech at Windham High School in New Hampshire.\n\n\"His new running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a plan that would let Governor Romney pay less than 1 percent in taxes each year,\" Obama told the cheering crowd during the August 18 speech. \"And here\u2019s the kicker, he expects you to pick up the tab.\"\n\nMuch has been made of Romney\u2019s taxes in recent months, as the millionaire former Massachusetts governor has declined to release most of his returns. But saying he would pay next to nothing in taxes each year under Ryan\u2019s plan is a new one.\n\nWe decided to crunch the numbers.\n\nOver eight terms in Congress, Ryan has introduced a number of budget plans with a range of tax reforms. So, to figure out which plan the president was referring to, we approached the Obama campaign, which pointed us to Ryan\u2019s first proposal, A Roadmap for America\u2019s Future.\n\nRyan first introduced this plan in 2010, before he became chairman of the House Budget Committee. He proposed at the time to do away with taxes on interest, dividends and long-term capital gains, among other reforms.\n\nThe plan stalled in committee and never reached the House floor for a vote. And Ryan and other House Republicans moved away from the tenets of the original plan with their later budget proposals, which included taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains.\n\nABC News\u00a0noted recently that Romney himself criticized a similar proposal during a January debate. The plan, introduced by Republican challenger and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, also proposed to do away with capital gains taxes.\n\n\"Under that plan, I'd have paid no taxes in the last two years,\" Romney told Gingrich, according to the debate transcript.\n\nBut, several major publications, along with Obama, place the number at closer to 1 percent.\n\nBoth Roll Call and the Atlantic\u00a0have published stories in recent weeks reporting Ryan\u2019s plan would have left Romney paying a tax rate of 1 percent or less. Each story based its calculations on Romney\u2019s 2010 tax return-- the most recent one released.\n\nIn his 2010 return, Romney reported $21.6 million in income. But, of that total, none of it came from wages or salary, according to federal tax documents. Instead, most of Romney\u2019s income came from capital gains ($12.5 million), dividends ($4.9 million), and taxable interest ($3.3 million), among other sources that would no longer be taxed under Ryan\u2019s plan.\n\nOn top of those figures, the Roadmap plan proposed to eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax, on which Romney paid nearly $233,000 in 2010, and it would have cut the top marginal tax rate from 35 to 25 percent on income over $100,000. This would have reduced the taxes Romney paid that year on his business income, about $594,000, much of which came from book and speaking fees.\n\nIn his Roll Call story, Steven T. Dennis didn\u2019t identify an exact tax rate, but he reported that these new deductions would amount to 95 percent of Romney\u2019s income that would no longer be taxed under Ryan\u2019s plan.\n\n\"It's not certain exactly how low Romney's tax bill would go, but his income from other sources amounts to about $1 million,\" Dennis wrote in the Aug. 11 story. \"Romney's total tax bill would have dropped from the $3 million that he paid to a few hundred thousand dollars if Ryan's plan had been in effect.\"\n\nIn his Atlantic piece, reporter Matthew O\u2019Brien takes his calculations a step further, totaling the amount Romney would have paid under the Ryan plan at just north of $175,000.\n\nThat number reflects the elimination of interest, dividends and capital gain taxes, as well as the Alternative Minimum tax, O\u2019Brien wrote in an email to PolitiFact. It considers the lower top marginal rate proposed under the plan, and it maintains the self-employment taxes that Romney paid in 2010, he wrote.\n\n\"Now, Romney would still owe self-employment taxes on his author and speaking fees, but that only amounts to $29,151,\" O\u2019Brien wrote in the Atlantic article. \"Add it all up, and Romney would have paid $177,650 out of a taxable income of $21,661,344, for a cool effective rate of 0.82 percent.\"\n\nTax analysts across the country haven\u2019t repeated O\u2019Brien\u2019s math exactly, but, looking at Ryan\u2019s plan, they feel the numbers are right on.\n\n\"The rough calculation by Matt O\u2019Brien strikes me as reasonable. \u2026 The bottom line is that given that we know the vast majority of Gov. Romney\u2019s income falls into the categories of interest, dividends, and capital gains, he would no doubt pay a far lower rate \u00a0\u2026,\" said Joseph Rosenberg, a research analyst with the Tax Policy Center, in an email.\n\nThe policy center is a joint venture between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"Very little of (Romney\u2019s) income is from ordinary working or business income,\" added Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at center. \"Given the amount of itemized deductions he had, at least on the 2010 return, that would wipe out close to all of them. \u2026 When you\u2019re Mitt Romney, that\u2019s a very good deal.\"\n\nOur ruling:\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Ryan\u2019s most recent budget proposal does not eliminate taxes on interest, dividends and long-term capital gains. Obama is correct, however, to suggest that Ryan at one point put forward a plan that would have eliminated them.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say how that budget proposal would have affected Romney\u2019s tax rate for \"each year.\" Romney hasn\u2019t released his tax returns before 2010, and his 2011 documents aren\u2019t finalized yet. But, looking at the snapshot of his 2010 return, it\u2019s safe to say his tax rate would have taken a nose dive.\n\nMore than $20 million of Romney's $21.6 million income that year came from interest, dividends and capital gains -- items that would no longer be taxed under Ryan\u2019s plan. Factor in a reduction in the top marginal tax rate and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, and Romney\u2019s tax rate would have fallen dramatically, almost surely reaching below 1 percent, according to media reports and tax analyses.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10526"}
