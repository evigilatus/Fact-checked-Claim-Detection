The news agency found that the false quote and the image also appeared after the 2019 mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand. The caption for that post claimed that a man named Abdullah Zuber made the remark to the BBC after the shooting. But the BBC told AFP it had not interviewed a person by that name.\nThe man pictured in the Facebook post was acquitted in 2014 by a court in Kolkata, India, after spending eight years in jail on terror charges; his name is Abdullah Juber, not Zuber, AFP reported. \nThe AFP also linked to a 2017 report on TwoCircles.net that said Juber\u2019s photo was \"being circulated for nefarious purposes with the aim of creating hatred towards Muslims.\"\n\"Juber\u2019s photograph which was exclusively captured by TwoCircles.net is being photoshopped and being circulated online with a quote which Juber never said,\" the 2017 TwoCircles.net post said.\nA quote about killing Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Atheists and attributed to \"Abdullah Zuber\" is not real. \nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17493"}
