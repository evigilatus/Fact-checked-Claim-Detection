Ron DeSantis is a key advocate for the bill. He disputes the ad\u2019s message.\n\"You think I\u2019m just going to, like, bring in a bunch of drugs from Pakistan and off the street?\" he said in an April 23 speech to the AARP. \"The safety is going to be there, and if it\u2019s not there, then we wouldn\u2019t want to do it.\"\nPolitiFact found no evidence to support the idea that Florida legislators want to import drugs from China with no oversight from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The ad says that the program would allow imported drugs from China, but the legislation calls for importing drugs from Canada.\n\"The FDA has the power to regulate any drugs sold in this country, regardless of where the drugs originated,\" said Robin Feldman, University of California Hastings law professor. \"Safety is key to the FDA\u2019s mission, and that mission encompasses drugs imported from other countries, as well as drugs sold directly here.\"\nThe legislation has moved forward in Senate committees, and a similar bill in the House passed 93-22 on April 11.\nSupporters say that it will lead to lower prices for consumers who struggle to pay for medicines. Opponents cast doubt about whether it will truly save money, and a conservative group, Americans for Tax Reform, called the bill \"socialist price controls.\" (The ad correctly quoted the Wall Street Journal editorial board criticizing the plan.)\nFederal government would have to approve Florida program\nSB 1528 would require the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration to establish a program to allow a vendor to import wholesale drugs into Florida pharmacies.\nIn theory, the federal government has a path to create such a program.\nA provision in a 2003 federal law empowers the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to approve state programs for wholesalers or pharmacies to import medications from Canada. Importers must comply with federal safeguards, including that the drugs be tested, and HHS would have to certify to Congress that the program poses no additional safety risk.\nNo HHS secretary has ever issued such an approval. Vermont, which passed drug importation legislation in 2018, plans to submit a proposal to HHS this year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ad omits that SB 1528 does have safety provisions, including that the drugs must meet the FDA\u2019s standards and entities involved would be subject to state rules, according to Senate staff analysis of the bill.\nThere are safeguards on the Canadian side, too. Under Canadian law, exporters must attest that the item is legal and complies with inspections of the destination country.\nForeign drugs are already in the U.S. The FDA estimates that 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and 40%\u00a0of the actual finished drugs in the U.S. market are manufactured in FDA-registered facilities in other countries, primarily India and China.\nImporting drugs from Canada or other countries has been a common practice in the United States\u00a0for many years.\u00a0Surveys\u00a0indicate that up to 8%\u00a0of Americans have bought medicines outside the country,\u00a0even though the practice is technically illegal. Americans buy the drugs for personal use either by driving across the border to Canada or Mexico\u00a0or by purchasing them on the internet. Local governments or schools, including in\u00a0Florida,\u00a0have helped their employees buy cheaper drugs from Canada or overseas.\nPartnership for Safe Medicines cites past problems associated with importation\nThe Partnership for Safe Medicines points to cases showing that foreign counterfeit medicines are already in the United States. For example, three Texans were prosecuted for importing 100,000 pills from China, and a Chinese drug importer distributed counterfeit drugs in the U.S.\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and four past FDA commissioners have raised concerns that entities claim to sell Canadian drugs actually obtained the drugs from elsewhere.\nFor example, in the 2005 FDA sting operation \"Bait and Switch\" the FDA found that drugs being promoted as Canadian, the vast majority came from other countries and many were counterfeit.\nMore recently, the online pharmacy Canada Drugs was fined $34 million in 2018 for importing counterfeit cancer drugs and other unapproved pharmaceuticals to health care providers.\nThese illegal operations are cause for concern, but those happened before Florida proposed a more structured, regulated importation program.\nJuliette Cubanski, an expert on Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that the question is whether it\u2019s possible to create a 100% foolproof system. If drugs are imported from facilities in Canada that are certified by FDA-equivalent authorities in Canada, that would be safer than ordering drugs online from a website that purports to be a Canadian pharmacy.\n\"It seems that what Florida and other states who are interested in drug importation are intending is to create safe, legitimate pathways for their residents to import prescription drugs from abroad,\" she said.\nOur ruling\nAn ad by Partnership for Safe Medicines said, \"State senators are pushing a new government program that allows prescription drugs from China without FDA inspection.\"\nSenators are actually pushing for an importation program from Canada, not China.\nIn its ad, the organization points to evidence of unscrupulous entities that purported to provide prescriptions from Canada but were actually obtaining drugs from elsewhere or counterfeit operations. Those cases are real, but it doesn\u2019t mean that a proposed Florida program will allow prescription drugs from China without federal oversight. The Florida program would require the federal government\u2019s approval, including state and federal safeguards, including those that involve the FDA.\nWe rate this claim False.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/68aa6af6-1b8d-45de-8f68-a976ef4332d8", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00712"}
