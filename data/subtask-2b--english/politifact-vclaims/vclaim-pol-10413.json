Charlie Bass, R-NHto be the next U.S. representative for New Hampshire\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, cried foul when she saw a new ad targeting her as a \"left-wing darling.\" She accused Bass of violating federal regulations with his ad, \"Not Working for Us,\" which is running locally on WMUR.\n\nAttack ads, like Bass\u2019, are subject to a specific set of rules, and when they are broken, the candidate is no longer entitled to the same ad rate as competitors, Kuster argued.\n\n\"Congressman Bass's campaign is in violation of a rule which states that within 45 days of the Primary Election, candidates must include \u2018a clearly identifiable photographic or similar image of the candidate\u2019 for a period of no less than four seconds at the end of advertisements,\" Kuster said in a news release emailed to New Hampshire reporters on Aug. 31. \"Congressman Bass\u2019s ad, \u2018Not Working for Us,\u2019 fails to meet this basic requirement and includes no photograph or other image of the candidate for any duration at the end of the advertisement.\"\n\nThe lowest unit charge\u00a0was established in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to protect candidates from excessive advertising costs -- charges no more than the lowest rates available to regular commercial advertisers.\n\nIt\u2019s ultimately up to the FCC to decide if its rules were broken, but PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to find out if Kuster was right about what the FCC rules say.\n\nWhen to show face\n\nKuster\u2019s Campaign Manager Garrick Delzell said he had no comment on the situation, but emailed us portions of Section 315 of The Communications Act of 1934\u00a0and a letter to WMUR outlining the accusations against Bass\u2019 advertisement.\n\nThe Communications Act requires that broadcast stations charge candidates for federal office for advertising \"during the forty-five days preceding the date of the primary runoff election and during the sixty days preceding the date of a general or special election, in which such person is a candidate, the lowest unit charge of the station for the same class and amount of time for the same period,\" said Paul Burkett, Kuster for Congress treasurer, in a letter to WMUR.\n\n\"A candidate loses this right to preferential pricing, however, if a candidates makes \u2018any direct reference to another candidate for the same office, in any broadcast using the rights and conditions of access under this Act, unless such reference meets requirements of subparagraphs (C) or (D).\u2019\"\n\nIn other words, Kuster argues that because Bass\u2019 ad is directed at her, it had to meet certain requirements.\n\nOK, so let\u2019s look at those subparagraphs. In this case it\u2019s C, which deals with television broadcasts. It says that at the end of a TV broadcast, two things must appear simultaneously:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(i) A clearly identifiable photographic or similar image of the candidate; and\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan Deal\n\n\nstated on July 30, 2010 in a press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican candidate for governor \"Karen Handel has run a 100 percent negative campaign.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 August 4, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(ii) A clearly readable printed statement, identifying the candidate and stating that the candidate has approved the broadcast and that the candidate\u2019s authorized committee paid for the broadcast.\n\nKuster is right that Bass\u2019 ad doesn\u2019t contain a photo of Bass during the last four seconds of the broadcast.In the ad, Bass\u2019 image does appear, but it\u2019s during the first two seconds of the spot. In addition, the first words people hear is \"I\u2019m Charlie Bass and I approve this message.\" During the last four seconds of the commercial, it displays the words, \"Approved and Paid for by Bass Victory Committee,\" and there\u2019sno picture of Bass.\n\nAccording to Kuster, that means \"the Bass Victory Committee and Charlie Bass are no longer entitled to benefit from the lowest unit charge.\"\n\nWe called the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nKnow your opponent\n\nThe extra photo requirement relies on the idea that Kuster and Bass are running for the same office. Cut and dried, right?\n\nWell,as it turns out, the section of the Communications Act that Kuster cited does not even apply to her race against Bass -- at least not yet.\n\nWhen Congress adopted Section 315, commonly referred to\u00a0as the \"equal opportunity\" or \"equal time\" provision, it required opposing candidates receive the same treatment -- that, if one candidate for an office gets air time, his opponent \"for that office\" is entitled to equal air time at the same cost, according to the FCC\u2019s \"The Law of Political Broadcasting and Cablecasting: Political Primer 1984.\"\n\nBut the term \"for that office\" requires some careful distinction. Which candidates are actually \u00a0opponents, and whether stations are required to afford them \"equal opportunity\" under Section 315, depends entirely on the election.\n\n\"The FCC for many years interpreted Section 315 to mean that before the primaries or the nominating conventions take place, only those candidates who seek the nomination of the same party for the same office are entitled to opportunities equal to those of each other, since only they are opponents at that point,\" according to the Primer.\n\nIn other words, the primary and the general election are considered two separate races. Opponents in a primary are candidates of the same party running for the nomination to run in the general election. Even if Bass and Kuster consider themselves opponents at this point, the FCC views it differently.\n\nIn Bass\u2019 case, his opponents are Gerard Beloin, Will Dean, Miroslaw Dziedzic and Dennis Lamare until the primary on Sept. 11.\n\nNo Democrats have filed to run against Kuster in the primary, but under FCC rules, she still wouldn\u2019t be Bass\u2019 opponent until the general election in November.\n\nThe content of Bass\u2019 \"Not Working For Us\" advertisement -- which has been running for more than a week -- does not deal with \"equal opportunity\" issues or violate Section 315 because, according to the FCC, Bass\u2019 opponents are the Republicans running against him in the primary, not his presumed Democratic opponent in the general election.\n\nFor its part, WMUR doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with the ad -- or what they are charging Bass for it.\n\n\"At this point, it\u2019s the opinion of our FCC attorney that the spot we\u2019re running is legal and the rates we\u2019re charging the campaign are fine as well,\" said Jeff Bartlett, WMUR\u2019s President and General Manager.\n\n\"From the FCC\u2019s point of view, that\u2019s fine,\" he added, referring to the image of Bass. \"You can run it at the beginning or the end. There\u2019s no regulation compelling us to do anything about it, because the FCC, which regulates us, says they can run it either place.\"\n\nEven if Bass and Kuster were currently considered opponents and Bass was found in violation of the rules, WMUR could still give him the lowest ad rate anyway, according to an opinion\u00a0published by the Federal Elections Commission.\n\n(It\u2019s worth noting, the Federal Election Commission has its own set of rules\u00a0ensuring candidates identify themselves in TV ads and the Bass advertisement passes those bars too \u2014 his image can appear at the beginning or the end.)\n\nOur ruling\n\nKuster says Bass\u2019 \"Not Working for Us\" TV ad forfeited its right to WMUR\u2019s lowest rates because it violated FCC rules.\n\nThe rules Kuster cite only apply to advertisements about Bass\u2019 Republican opponents in the primary. Until Kuster and Bass are direct opponents for the Second Congressional District general election race, her accusation is moot.\n\nMoreover, even if Bass did violate the rules, WMUR is still free to charge him the lowest rate.\n\nWe give Kuster a False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10413"}
