White said if he's in charge, \"it won\u2019t be done by things that are just across the board, Soviet style, you know, budget management that only career politicians seem to embrace.\"\nPressed by interviewer Evan Smith, White said: \"Is it just a coincidence that 5 percent is the appropriate amount for each state agency?... No. It\u2019s because that\u2019s the way that career politicians know how to run government.\"\nWe started our review of White's statement wondering what \"Soviet-style\" budget management means. Several expert professors said that historically, the term didn't refer to across-the-board budget cuts.\nProfessor Paul Gregory of the University of Houston Department of History said \"Soviet style\" makes him think of a monopoly party (in this case, the Communist Party) dictating everything to subordinates without any possibility of change. Gregory said Soviet-style budgeting also means hiding expenditures you don\u2019t want people to see\u2014such as massive investments in military infrastructure.\nPeter Caldwell, a Rice University professor of history, said budget-writing in the Soviet Union most often consisted of \u201chuge and crude\u201d decisions to invest in one part of the economy at the expense of another.\nAnd H. Stephen Gardner, chairman of the Baylor University Department of Economics, said he\u2019d define Soviet-style management as overly centralized as opposed to giving autonomy to individual units of government.\nSo are there \"Soviet style\" ways that state leaders have approached the budget?\nSome background: In January, Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus--mindful of a projected state revenue shortfall that could reach $15 billion by next January--jointly asked agencies to submit plans identifying savings in 5 percent \u201cpriority increments\u201d in their 2010-11 appropriations from state revenue. Such plans could lead to cuts, though no decisions have been made and some programs have already been excused.\nNo doubt, the leaders' request is a centralized one. But is it Soviet-style in any other way? We turned to White for elaboration.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite\u2019s campaign pointed us to a statement issued by White, the former Houston mayor, in January: \u201cWell-run organizations cut spending based on priorities and where they can best attain productivity improvements. So, for example, in the city of Houston we made smaller cuts in public safety because that was the highest priority. And we were able to cut more in garbage collection and disposal through productivity improvements.\u201d\nWhite then told us that by \"Soviet style,\" he doesn't mean that Texas state government owns the means of production, as in the Soviet Union. \u201cObviously we have a market system,\u201d White said.\nHe described his alternative approach to the looming revenue gap, saying that as governor, he'd focus on funding priorities such as education while encouraging agencies to improve productivity via \"process re-engineering\" without hurting the delivery of services to taxpayers. He said the state also would seek savings by renegotiating vendor contracts. Also, he said, there\u2019d be regular meetings with agency chiefs to talk about how they\u2019re cutting spending and avoiding non-essential hirings.\n\u201cI would have had reports back to me weekly and monthly concerning the efficiencies identified,\u201d White said.\u00a0We didn't get to why White considers the existing approach \"Soviet style\" before he had to go.\nWe\u00a0asked the professors if \"Soviet style\" accurately characterizes the GOP leaders' request for proposed budget cuts.\nGregory said describing the request from Perry, et al. that way \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have any relevance to what was actually practiced in the Soviet Union. ... It's inappropriate to use that term.\"\nGardner agreed, saying: \"It\u2019s a bit hyperbolic to refer to this (budget cutting) as Soviet style. I should admit I have done exactly the same thing myself on matters of budgeting.\u201d\nThe point of saying as much, Gardner said, is to elicit an emotional reaction. He added that Republicans who cast President Barack Obama as socialist \u2014 Perry has told reporters he thinks Obama has socialist beliefs \u2014 are likewise guilty of hyperbole for dramatic effect. The professor, who said he considers Obama a centrist, speculated that Noam Chomsky, a left-leaning linguist who writes on public affairs, would call the president a \"crazed capitalist.\"\n\"If White\u2019s point is that budget management is being handled in an overly centralized way,\" Gardner said, \"I can see the element of truth there. The problem I would have is even if you say I am going to be more careful and more surgically look at the right places to cut, you\u2019re still using a more centralized approach.\u201d\nCaldwell agreed with the psychological impact, if not the accuracy, of \"Soviet style.\" Generally, he said, \u201canyone who ever mentions the Soviet economy or Naziism when they\u2019re talking about American domestic debate is usually off track. They\u2019re referring to crude examples to raise the stakes of a debate. They\u2019re not necessarily wanting a careful, rational debate. Who in America wants the Soviet economy or supports Naziism?\u201d\nOur conclusion? The GOP leaders' request that agencies submit proposed budget cuts isn\u2019t Soviet style \u2014 not even close.\nAt best, White's statement is an example of how politicians try to light up a room. It's so off base, we're lighting up the meter: Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15105"}
