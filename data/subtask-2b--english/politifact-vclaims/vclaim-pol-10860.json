It earned a Half True from PolitiFact National, which said the numbers were outdated by six months, somewhat off the mark and from a respected but unproven data-analysis firm.\n\nWe wondered what the numbers look like now, with another 10 months in the books.\n\nIn this case, we\u2019ll look only at the income trend, not to what degree Obama is to blame for any decline. In Janesville, Romney surely was out to criticize Obama, but his remarks show it was more for being out of touch than saying he was responsible for creating the problem.\n\nThe gold standard of income data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey -- Annual Social and Economic Supplements. But it is generated only once a year, so it is not very timely. The 2011 data is not out yet. More on that later.\n\nIn both instances, Romney turned to household income figures generated by a private economic research agency, Maryland-based Sentier Research. The firm uses other Census Bureau income data that is released monthly and adjusts it to provide a more timely look at income trends. Its reports have become widely quoted in media accounts.\n\nIn January, and again in Janesville, Romney said he was comparing changes in the \"last four years,\" which takes us to different periods in the George W. Bush presidency as the starting point. We examined Sentier\u2019s reports from April 2008 to April 2012, the latest available from the firm at the time of Romney\u2019s speech.\n\nThe inflation-adjusted median household income declined 8.3 percent when comparing those two points in time, a decline of $4,596 per household.\n\nSo by the latest numbers in the report Romney used, he\u2019s in the ballpark but off more than a percentage point.\n\nCase closed? Not quite.\n\nRomney\u2019s campaign told us \u00a0relied on a reference to earlier Sentier research that was highlighted in an April 30, 2012, Bloomberg news report.\n\nThat piece referred to February 2012 data from Sentier showing a 9.7 percent drop compared with the same month in 2008. The big swing in just a couple months is not unusual in the month-to-month data.\n\nSo, as in the presidential debate reference, Romney was very close using outdated data, but high compared to the latest data available when he spoke.\n\nEither way, according to the Sentier data, the income trend has gone the wrong direction in the last four years. Median household incomes move up and down, but overall trended sharply downward during Obama\u2019s first two and a half years before recovering somewhat since summer 2011, according to the firm\u2019s index.\n\nThe more standard source of income statistics, the annual Census Bureau data, has figures only through 2010 because 2011 is not out yet. That survey asks people in the spring what they earned for the previous calendar year.\n\nUsing that annual data for a four-year comparison going back to 2007, incomes declined 6.4 percent from 2007 to 2010.\n\nBecause the reference periods are different, the trends identified by the annual census data can\u2019t really be compared directly to monthly census data that Sentier uses. \u00a0\n\nPolitiFact National has examined in detail the data source that Romney uses, Sentier Research. The firm is run by two retired Census Bureau officials (one of whom, Gordon Green, directed the income statistics program) whose work has been cited in many national news publications. Sentier\u2019s client list has included major government clients and think tanks on both sides of the ideological spectrum.\n\nEconomists have said the Sentier-created income index fills a knowledge gap in a timely way, but still has to stand the test of time.\n\nOur rating\n\nRomney chided Obama for being out of touch, saying that median household incomes have fallen 10 percent. He uses data from a reputable private firm that used census data to create a new income index.\n\nAt one point in Obama\u2019s term incomes were down about 10 percent from four years earlier, but the decline is now closer to 8 percent, based on the firm\u2019s data. Romney continues to use the outdated figure, making the decline sound somewhat larger than it is.\n\nWe\u2019ll stick with the Half True rating he received in January, based on the Truth-O-Meter definition of a claim that is \"partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10860"}
