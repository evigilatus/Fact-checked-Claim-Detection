Raiding money from their pensions to fund the President\u2019s wasteful vanity project is outrageous. Our servicemembers deserve better,\" Harris said on March 8 on Twitter and Facebook.\nIs the Trump administration really planning to raid military pensions?\nFactCheck.org, along with some social media users who commented on Harris\u2019 posts, described her claim as misleading or wrong. We decided to fact-check her provocative statement ourselves.\nBackground on Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration \nDemocratic leaders have called Trump\u2019s emergency declaration a power grab, and some Republicans also said it sets a dangerous precedent.\nThe move allows the president to transfer $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall, according to the White House. It also gives him the ability to tap $2.5 billion from drug interdiction programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement in February: \"The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.\"\nThe House and Senate voted this month to block the declaration. Trump vetoed the joint resolution shortly after. A bid to override the veto failed this week in the House.\nSixteen states, including California, have filed a federal lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s authority to divert funds for the border wall.\nExamining Harris\u2019 claim\nTo support her statement, Harris linked in her social media posts to a March 7 Associated Press article. Reading just the headline -- \"Pentagon may tap military pay, pensions for border wall\" -- Harris\u2019 claim seems mostly accurate.\nBut the first paragraph describes the money as \"leftover funds,\" casts a different light.\nThe Pentagon is planning to tap $1 billion in leftover funds from military pay and pension accounts to help President Donald Trump pay for his long-sought border wall, a top Senate Democrat said Thursday.\nThe money is available because the Army missed a recruitment goal by 6,500 enlistees. Additionally, fewer soldiers opted to take financial incentives for voluntary early retirement, according to the article.\nThe Pentagon plans to move the extra money to its drug interdiction account, freeing it up to spend on border barriers, the AP reported.\nExperts say claim misses the mark\nTo further assess Harris\u2019 claim of raiding pensions, we spoke with three experts on federal defense budgets. Each said the senator\u2019s statement was inaccurate.\n\"It\u2019s off-base,\" said Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan, nonprofit policy research organization.\nHe said the money is leftover in certain Army personnel accounts.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\n\nstated on February 3, 2021 in a press conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what (QAnon) is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s a separate issue worth debating whether that money should be used for the border wall or should be used for other purposes within the military. But the fact that they\u2019re moving money out of these accounts is not an indication that anyone is cutting military pay or cutting benefits or pension payments. That\u2019s not the case.\"\nNo military service member\u2019s pension would be reduced, he said.\nMark Cancian, who worked for the White House Office of Management and Budget on defense budget strategy during the Obama administration, agreed that Harris\u2019 statement is wrong.\n\"The answer is, \u2018No.\u2019 They are not raiding military pensions,\" Cancian said. \"I\u2019m sure the Army had some places they would have preferred to send that money. But they are not taking any money from pensions.\"\nCancian is now a senior advisor with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nTravis Sharp directs the budget program at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, which provides independent defense budget analysis. He also said Harris\u2019 statement is flawed.\n\"This is another example of there being a lot of confusion about what it means to cut something in the budget,\" Sharp said.\nTransferring money after an agency overestimated how much something would cost is not the same as a cut, he said.\n\"The Department of Defense has to budget in advance for things that are unpredictable,\" Sharp said. \"The money that\u2019s leftover is what the Trump administration is trying to reallocate. Does that constitute a cut? In my opinion, no. That\u2019s not a cut.\"\nWhen the Pentagon has funds remaining in one account, it can \"reprogram\" the money to others, such as a health care or fuel accounts that have a budget shortfall, Cancian said.\nIf that doesn\u2019t happen, Congress \"will rescind that money and use it for other purposes,\" Harrison, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.\nThe Department of Defense did not respond to a request for comment.\nA spokesperson for the Harris campaign provided a written statement:\n\"The AP reported that money is being transferred from a fund dedicated to pensions of armed service members. The President is trying to circumvent Congress who refused to give him funding for this wall by diverting resources from other military funds.\"\nThe spokesperson would not say whether the senator stood by the original claim.\nOur rating\nSen. Kamala Harris claimed the Trump administration was \"raiding money\" from the military pensions of service members to pay for the wall.\nIn reality, the Pentagon plans to move leftover pay and retirement funds that are available because fewer soldiers opted for an early retirement program and because the Army missed a recruitment goal by 6,500 enlistees.\nNo service members would lose pay or retirement benefits as a result of the move, according to experts on federal defense budgets.\nThe headline in the article Harris relied on did not make this clear. But it\u2019s important for anyone, especially a public official, to read beyond a headline before making such a claim.\nThe debate over whether the Trump administration should tap this money is a separate issue.\nHarris\u2019 claim was off-the-mark.\nWe rate it False.\n\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2019-03-28 20:04:46 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Trump administration is \u2018raiding money\u2019 from military service member pensions to pay for the border wall.
