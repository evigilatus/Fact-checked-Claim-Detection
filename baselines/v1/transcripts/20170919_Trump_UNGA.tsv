0001	Donald Trump	Mr. SecretaryGeneral, Mr. President, world leaders and distinguished delegates, welcome to New York.
0002	Donald Trump	It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.
0003	Donald Trump	As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid.
0004	Donald Trump	The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.
0005	Donald Trump	Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th.
0006	Donald Trump	The stock market is at an alltime high, a record.
0007	Donald Trump	Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before.
0008	Donald Trump	Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.
0009	Donald Trump	And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.
0010	Donald Trump	Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been.
0011	Donald Trump	For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements and religions have stood before this assembly.
0012	Donald Trump	Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today, but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.
0013	Donald Trump	We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity.
0014	Donald Trump	Breakthroughs in science, technology and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.
0015	Donald Trump	But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value.
0016	Donald Trump	Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet.
0017	Donald Trump	Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists, but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.
0018	Donald Trump	Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.
0019	Donald Trump	International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people force dislocation and mass migration threaten our borders.
0020	Donald Trump	And new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.
0021	Donald Trump	To put it simply, we meet at a time of both immense promise and great peril.
0022	Donald Trump	It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.
0023	Donald Trump	We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred and fear.
0024	Donald Trump	This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future.
0025	Donald Trump	It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security and promote their prosperity.
0026	Donald Trump	It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.
0027	Donald Trump	Those three beautiful pillars, they're pillars of peace sovereignty, security and prosperity.
0028	Donald Trump	The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent and free.
0029	Donald Trump	As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations.
0030	Donald Trump	The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.
0031	Donald Trump	To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
0032	Donald Trump	Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity and peace for themselves and for the world.
0033	Donald Trump	We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions or even systems of government.
0034	Donald Trump	But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
0035	Donald Trump	This is the beautiful vision of this institution.
0036	Donald Trump	And this is the foundation for cooperation and success.
0037	Donald Trump	Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.
0038	Donald Trump	Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny.
0039	Donald Trump	And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.
0040	Donald Trump	In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.
0041	Donald Trump	This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example.
0042	Donald Trump	We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution, the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.
0043	Donald Trump	This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity and freedom for the Americans, and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity and the rule of law.
0044	Donald Trump	The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three, beautiful words.
0045	Donald Trump	They are "We the people.""
0046	Donald Trump	Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words
0047	Donald Trump	In America the people govern, the people rule and the people are sovereign.
0048	Donald Trump	I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people where it belongs.
0049	Donald Trump	In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.
0050	Donald Trump	Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens, to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights and to defend their values.
0051	Donald Trump	As president of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always and should always put your countries first.
0052	Donald Trump	All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nationstate remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
0053	Donald Trump	But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
0054	Donald Trump	The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.
0055	Donald Trump	But we can no longer be taken advantage of or enter into a onesided deal where the United States gets nothing in return.
0056	Donald Trump	As long as I hold this office, I will defend America's interest above all else.
0057	Donald Trump	But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it's in everyone's interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous and secure.
0058	Donald Trump	America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations charter.
0059	Donald Trump	Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall.
0060	Donald Trump	America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe, to the deserts of the Middle East, to the jungles of Asia.
0061	Donald Trump	It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others.
0062	Donald Trump	Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security and prosperity for all.
0063	Donald Trump	For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope.
0064	Donald Trump	We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife.
0065	Donald Trump	We are guided by outcomes, not ideology.
0066	Donald Trump	We have a policy of principled realism rooted in shared goals, interests and values.
0067	Donald Trump	That realism forces us to confront the question facing every leader and nation in this room.
0068	Donald Trump	It is a question we cannot escape or avoid.
0069	Donald Trump	We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats and even wars that we face, or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?
0070	Donald Trump	If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent.
0071	Donald Trump	We must protect our nations, their interests and their futures.
0072	Donald Trump	We must reject threats to sovereignty from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.
0073	Donald Trump	We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow, and just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil and terror.
0074	Donald Trump	The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based.
0075	Donald Trump	They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.
0076	Donald Trump	If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph when decent people and nations become bystanders to history.
0077	Donald Trump	The forces of destruction only gather power and strength.
0078	Donald Trump	No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.
0079	Donald Trump	It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans and for the imprisonment, torture, killing and oppression of countless more.
0080	Donald Trump	We were all witness to the regime's deadly abuse.
0081	Donald Trump	When an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later.
0082	Donald Trump	We saw it in the assassination of the dictator's brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport.
0083	Donald Trump	We know it kidnapped a sweet 13 year old, Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea's spies.
0084	Donald Trump	If this is not twisted enough now, North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.
0085	Donald Trump	It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would armed supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict.
0086	Donald Trump	No nation on Earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals armed itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.
0087	Donald Trump	The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
0088	Donald Trump	Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
0089	Donald Trump	The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary.
0090	Donald Trump	That's what the United Nations is all about.
0091	Donald Trump	That's what the United Nations is for.
0092	Donald Trump	Let's see how they do.
0093	Donald Trump	It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.
0094	Donald Trump	The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15nothing votes, adopting hardhitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council.
0095	Donald Trump	Thank you to all involved, but we must do much more.
0096	Donald Trump	It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.
0097	Donald Trump	We face this decision, not only in North Korea.
0098	Donald Trump	It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime, one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel and ruin for many leaders and nations.
0099	Donald Trump	In this room, the Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy.
0100	Donald Trump	It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogues whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos.
0101	Donald Trump	The longest suffering victims of Iran's leaders are, in fact its own people, rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful, Arab and Israeli neighbors
0102	Donald Trump	This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran's people, also goes to shore up Basha alAssad's dictatorship, fuel Yemeni Civil War and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.
0103	Donald Trump	We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.
0104	Donald Trump	The Iran deal was one of the worst and most onesided transactions the United States has ever entered into frankly that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don't think you've heard the last of it.
0105	Donald Trump	Believe me.
0106	Donald Trump	It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.
0107	Donald Trump	It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained and, above all, Iran's government must stop supporting terrorists begin serving its own people and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.
0108	Donald Trump	The entire world understands that the good people of Iran won't change and other than the vast military power of the United States that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.
0109	Donald Trump	This is what causes the regime to restrict internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protesters and imprisoned political reformers.
0110	Donald Trump	Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the people will face a choice.
0111	Donald Trump	Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed and terror, or will the Iranian people return to the nation's proud roots as a center of civilization, culture and wealth, where their people can be happy and prosperous?
0112	Donald Trump	Once again, the Iranian regime support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its finance in Saudi Arabia.
0113	Donald Trump	Early last year I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.
0114	Donald Trump	We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamic extremism that inspires them.
0115	Donald Trump	We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation and indeed to tear up the entire world.
0116	Donald Trump	We must deny the terrorists, safehaven, transit funding and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology
0117	Donald Trump	We must drive them out of our nations.
0118	Donald Trump	It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people, the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East.
0119	Donald Trump	To crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens, they use to launch attacks on all of our people.
0120	Donald Trump	Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.
0121	Donald Trump	From now on, our security interest will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.
0122	Donald Trump	I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq.
0123	Donald Trump	We have made big gains toward lasting defeat of Isis.
0124	Donald Trump	In fact, our country has achieved more against Isis in the last eight months than it has in many many years combined.
0125	Donald Trump	We seek the deescalation of the Syrian conflict and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people the actions of the criminal regime of Bashar alAssad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens.
0126	Donald Trump	Even innocent children shock the conscience of every decent person.
0127	Donald Trump	No society could be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread.
0128	Donald Trump	That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.
0129	Donald Trump	We appreciate the efforts of the United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.
0130	Donald Trump	The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
0131	Donald Trump	We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people and which enables their eventual return to their home countries.
0132	Donald Trump	To be part of the rebuilding process for the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.
0133	Donald Trump	Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the g20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible.
0134	Donald Trump	This is the safe responsible and humanitarian approach for decades.
0135	Donald Trump	The United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere.
0136	Donald Trump	We have learned that over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries for the sending countries.
0137	Donald Trump	It reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms for the receiving countries.
0138	Donald Trump	The substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by lowincome citizens, whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.
0139	Donald Trump	I want to salute the work of the United Nations and seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.
0140	Donald Trump	The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa.
0141	Donald Trump	The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine, prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia and northern Nigeria and Yemen.
0142	Donald Trump	We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief, the president's malaria initiative, the global health security agenda, the Global Fund to end modern slavery and the woman entrepreneurs' finance initiative.
0143	Donald Trump	Part of our commitment to empowering women.
0144	Donald Trump	All across the globe, we also thank.
0145	Donald Trump	We also thank the SecretaryGeneral for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security and prosperity.
0146	Donald Trump	Too often, the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.
0147	Donald Trump	In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution's noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them.
0148	Donald Trump	For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments, with egregious human rights records, sit on the UN Human Rights Council.
0149	Donald Trump	The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.
0150	Donald Trump	In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes.
0151	Donald Trump	The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.
0152	Donald Trump	Major portions of the world are in conflict and some in fact are going to hell, but the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.
0153	Donald Trump	The American people hope that, one day soon, the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world.
0154	Donald Trump	In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share.
0155	Donald Trump	The burden militarily or financially, nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.
0156	Donald Trump	That is why, in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt destabilizing regime in Cuba and embrace the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom.
0157	Donald Trump	My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
0158	Donald Trump	We have also imposed tough calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in venezuela, which has brought a oncethriving nation to the brink of total collapse
0159	Donald Trump	The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country.
0160	Donald Trump	This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere.
0161	Donald Trump	It has been tried to make matters worse.
0162	Donald Trump	Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.
0163	Donald Trump	The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing, their democratic institutions are being destroyed.
0164	Donald Trump	This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch as a responsible, neighbor and friend.
0165	Donald Trump	We and all others have a goal.
0166	Donald Trump	That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country and restore their democracy.
0167	Donald Trump	I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.
0168	Donald Trump	The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.
0169	Donald Trump	We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.
0170	Donald Trump	We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.
0171	Donald Trump	Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.
0172	Donald Trump	I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis.
0173	Donald Trump	We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela.
0174	Donald Trump	The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented from the Soviet Union to Cuba, to Venezuela wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted.
0175	Donald Trump	It has delivered anguish and devastation and failure.
0176	Donald Trump	Those who preach the tenants of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.
0177	Donald Trump	America stands with every person living under a brutal regime.
0178	Donald Trump	Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action.
0179	Donald Trump	All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
0180	Donald Trump	In America.
0181	Donald Trump	We seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of goodwill, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.
0182	Donald Trump	For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success.
0183	Donald Trump	But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factors disappeared, others gamed the system and broke the rules and our great middle class once the bedrock of American prosperity was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.
0184	Donald Trump	While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government, the duty of our citizens.
0185	Donald Trump	This bond is the source of America's strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.
0186	Donald Trump	If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the independent strength of its members.
0187	Donald Trump	If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign and independent nations, nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies nations that seek allies to be friend, not enemies.
0188	Donald Trump	To conquer and most important of all nations that are home to patriots to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries their fellow citizens and for all that is best in the human spirit.
0189	Donald Trump	In remembering the great victory that led to this body's founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved patriotism led the polls to die, to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France and the Brits to stand strong for Britain today if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.
0190	Donald Trump	We cannot wait for someone else for faraway countries or faroff bureaucracies.
0191	Donald Trump	We can't do it.
0192	Donald Trump	We must solve our problems to build our prosperity to secure our future or we will build vulnerable to decay domination and defeat.
0193	Donald Trump	The true question for the United Nations today for people all over the world who hope for better for themselves and their children is a basic one.
0194	Donald Trump	Are we still Patriots?
0195	Donald Trump	Do we love our nation's enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures?
0196	Donald Trump	Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?
0197	Donald Trump	One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was affected before the war commenced.
0198	Donald Trump	The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people.
0199	Donald Trump	That was the moment when America awoke when we looked around and understood that we were a nation, we realized who we were, what we valued and what we would give our lives to defend from its very first moments.
0200	Donald Trump	The American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.
0201	Donald Trump	The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, Security and Prosperity for all.
0202	Donald Trump	Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people and their patriotism.
0203	Donald Trump	History is asking us whether we are up to the task.
0204	Donald Trump	Our answer will be a renewal of will a rediscovery of resolve and a rebirth of devotion.
0205	Donald Trump	We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.
0206	Donald Trump	Our hope is a word and world of proud independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful earth.
0207	Donald Trump	This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.
0208	Donald Trump	So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world.
0209	Donald Trump	We will fight together, sacrifice together and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity and for the Almighty God who made us all.
0210	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0211	Donald Trump	God bless you.
0212	Donald Trump	God bless the nations of the world and god bless the United States of America.
0213	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
