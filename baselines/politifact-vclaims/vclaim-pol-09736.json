Minority Leader Richard Saslaw has spearheaded the opposition this winter to Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s plan to raise transportation revenues by abolishing the state gas tax and replacing it with a sales tax increase.\n\nSaslaw, D-Fairfax, says the only way to raise ample money for roads is to increase both the sales and the gas tax. He introduced an unsuccessful bill that would have raised Virginia\u2019s 5 percent sales tax to 6 percent. It also would have increased the state\u2019s 17.5-cent a gallon gas excise tax by 5 cents a gallon during each of the next two years and set the levy to automatically rise at the inflation rate of construction costs.\n\nMcDonnell says that the gas tax is outdated and will produce declining revenues in the future as cars become more fuel efficient. Saslaw says the problems with Virginia\u2019s flat gas tax are that it\u2019s not indexed to inflation and has not been increased since 1987. That\u2019s a far cry from other states, he claims.\n\n\"There\u2019s a reason the other 49 states keep raising their gas tax,\" Saslaw during a Jan. 15 news conference called by the Senate Democratic Caucus to lay out its positions on key issues, including transportation.\n\nHe repeated the statement at the end of the news conference. \"Everybody, all the other states, raise their gas tax except Virginia,\" Saslaw said. \"Naturally, your gas tax isn\u2019t going to grow.\"\n\nWhen we contacted Saslaw, he said he may have misspoken. The senator said he was trying to make a point that, with few exceptions, other states have raised their gasoline excise tax since Virginia\u2019s rate went into effect 26 years ago.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know of a state that hasn\u2019t raised their gas tax since 1986,\" Saslaw told us. \"Some of them, they\u2019ve gone up quite a few times.\"\n\nSaslaw, who's been in the General Assembly since 1976, acknowledged he could have worded his original statement better, saying perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have said all the other states \"keep\" raising their gas taxes.\n\nMost states do not routinely raise their gas taxes, we learned after consulting a September 2012 report by the Federal Highway Administration and a December 2011 study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\n\nExcise gas taxes regularly increase in 14 states. That\u2019s because they have variables in their tax rates that periodically rise with inflation or the price of gas.\n\nOf the remaining 36 states with flat rates, 25 have not increased their excise tax in 10 years of more. And 14 of those states -- including Virginia -- have not raised the levy in 20 years or more.\n\nVirginia\u2019s gas tax rate, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1987, is the second oldest in the nation. It bows only to Alaska, which implemented its 8-cent gas tax in 1970, although it was suspended for a year in 2008.\n\nVirginia\u2019s 26-year-old tax has a peer group, however. South Carolina\u2019s 16-cent per gallon tax went into effect in July 1987. Oklahoma\u2019s 17 cent rate was established in May 1987. New Jersey\u2019s 10.5-cent tax went into effect in July 1988 while Tennessee\u2019s 20-cent levy went into effect in July 1989.\n\nOur ruling\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaslaw said the 49 other states keep raising their gas tax.\n\nTwenty-five states have not raised their gas tax in a decade or more, and 14 of those states -- including Virginia -- have gone at least two decades without an increase.\n\nSaslaw offers no proof for his claim and acknowledges he may have misspoken. His statement is wrong, without basis and we give it our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09736"}
