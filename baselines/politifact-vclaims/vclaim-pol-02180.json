Andrew M. Cuomo touts New York state as a progressive beacon for the rest of the country.\nBut his primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, says that\u2019s not true when it comes to recreational marijuana. It\u2019s not legal in New York state.\nCuomo was asked about the issue during a recent exchange with reporters on Long Island.\n\"Given what\u2019s happened in Massachusetts, California, what could happen in New Jersey, do you feel as if New York is behind on this at all?\" NY1 Reporter Zack Fink asked Cuomo.\n\"No, I think we\u2019re actually ahead on it,\" Cuomo said. \"We announced months ago that we were going to study the legalization issue precisely for that reason.

States with legal marijuana have mostly shrugged off the decision.\nContext matters here. A reporter asked Cuomo if New York state was falling behind states that already legalized recreational marijuana. Cuomo said\u00a0New York state was not, and his full response makes little mention of the federal position.\nStates with legal marijuana\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana.\nThe state legislature in Vermont recently voted to make recreational marijuana legal later this year.
