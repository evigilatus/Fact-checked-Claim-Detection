Trump tweet about White House, Russian hacking probe", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump continues to question whether the Russian government tried to interfere in the U.S. election.

Trump asked on Twitter.\n\"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\" Trump tweeted early Dec. 15.\nIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2016\n\nOnly that\u2019s not true. The administration announced its findings a month before Election Day, and the White House\u2019s announcement prompted a memorable exchange at the final presidential debate.\nWho\u2019s the puppet? \nOn Oct. 7 \u2014 a few months after WikiLeaks released a trove of DNC emails, but the same day WikiLeaks released emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s administration said it was confident Russia was behind the cyberattacks.\n\"The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations,\" read an Oct. 7 joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community consists of 17 agencies and organizations within the executive branch, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks on the group\u2019s behalf.\nTheir statement said releases of alleged hacked emails on DCLeaks.com and Wikileaks and by the online persona Guccifer 2.0 were \"consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.\"\n\"These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process,\" the statement said. \"Such activity is not new to Moscow\u2014the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\"\nClinton used the statement as ammo when she referred to Trump as Putin\u2019s preferred \"puppet\" in the Oct. 19 presidential debate. (\"No puppet, you\u2019re the puppet,\" Trump replied.) When Clinton brought up the intelligence community\u2019s statement, Trump said, \"She has no idea whether it is Russia, China or anybody else.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-election doubts\nAfter the election, Trump has been just as dismissive about Russian involvement.\nRegarding Russia\u2019s involvement in the DNC email hack, Trump told Time magazine (which named him Person of the Year), \"I don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe they interfered.\"\nOn Dec. 12, Trump also questioned the timing of concerns about election-related hacks, tweeting, \"Unless you catch \u2018hackers\u2019 in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?\"\nRepublican and Democratic leaders have raised concerns about Russia\u2019s role in the election and have called for a congressional investigation.\nAccording to a New York Times investigation, Obama warned Putin about the cyberhacking and potential U.S. retaliation in person at the G-20 summit in China.\nThe administration, however, chose to issue the joint written statement from Homeland Security and the national intelligence director rather than a more public rebuke from Obama. \"It was far less dramatic than the president\u2019s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony,\" the New York Times noted.\nObama was aware of Russian hackers previously targeting the State Department, White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the New York Times reported, but he chose not to publicly call out Russians or issue sanctions out of \"fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia\u2019s cooperation in negotiations over Syria.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted, \"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\"\nAbout a month before the Nov. 8 \u00a0election, the Obama administration accused Russia of interfering in the U.S. elections, directing the release of emails \"from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\"\nThis didn\u2019t happen under the radar. Trump was confronted with it at the final presidential debate.\nFor a ridiculously wrong statement, we rate it Pants on Fire!\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bbbb8841-550b-4b5d-85d3-89c77f2a8220", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03865"}
