Mendoza, now the State Comptroller, voted to put an end to the executions, but the records and news reports from those days showed that the fate of the measure did not reverse its support. Now, Mayor Tony Brequinkel's competitor has come up with a new announcement to reconsider a counterproductive attitude to the death penalty. He's using selective and tricky editing of the video for a speech in the House Hall of Representatives Mendoza just before January 6, 2011, a voice to make it sound wrong. But there was a lot of observations made by Mendoza that the Brickinkle campaign chose to be left on the floor of the cutting room. And those deletions tell a very different story. Selective editorials from the debate in the House of Representatives since today in 2011, in which Mendoza spoke, show that her purpose is to describe an evolution in her thinking. She opened her remarks by explaining how today was the \"end of a long and difficult journey\" for her in the present case, and then spoke of her earlier push to expand the scope of the death penalty. This is where the Brickinkle Declaration is picked up. In the ad, Mendoza's line about how she could carry out the death penalty \"... and sleep like a kid at night...\" with the text. What both the edited footage and the missing pieces leave is that they only referred to cases in which they knew \"no doubt\" that a convicted criminal was a \"police murderer or serial killer.\" The Declaration also repeals Mendoza's remarks before reaching its main point - that very many people on death row in Illinois were later found innocent. \"This debate for me is no longer about whether the guilty killers deserve to die for their crimes, they deserve to die,\" said Mendoza, according to the text of the discussion, just as it does in the Declaration. She then explained how the State &apos; s record of sentencing those sentenced to death who had subsequently been acquitted had changed her mind. \"I have realized that in order to ensure justice in the form of death to an evil cancer in our society we must accept the possibility of executing an innocent person. I'm not okay with it, and none of us should be okay with it,\" she said at the time. On November 19, 2018, Susana Mendoza mentioned in the debate \"I was the decisive vote to abolish the death penalty in Illinois.\" \u2022 On November 25, 2018, not only did the Proquinkel Declaration ignore all of this, but it left the impression that Mendoza was arguing to keep the death penalty on hold. It does so by selectively repeating the edited parts of its observations with an old reference from the story of Velczyk.org, which refers to the poor state record of false convictions. The problem, of course, is that Mendoza, in the remarks that the BRICKINKLE Declaration chose to delete, specifically refers to those unlawful convictions as the reason why she changed her mind on the death penalty. When we approached the Brequinkel campaign to ask why the Declaration was considered an accurate representation of Mendoza's record, Monica Trevino's spokesperson responded by e-mail highlighting the vote of the House of Representatives from Mendoza in 2001 to expand the scope of the death penalty. It has also sponsored this bill. \"Mandoza, despite her voice in 2011, testified at the same time that she still believed in the death penalty, that she could carry out the death penalty herself and sleep like a child at night,\" added Trevino. \"The Declaration reflected its extremist values in this case.\" :: Our judgement of very selective liberation uses video clips from a speech delivered by Mendoza on the floor of Beit Illinois in 2011 in which it declared its opposition to the death penalty to give the impression that it has in fact been an enthusiastic supporter. While it is true that Mendoza supported the expansion of the death penalty a decade ago, the discourse from which the sections were taken was quite different. She changed her mind and wants to end the death penalty in Illinois because the state sentenced a lot of people to death. In fact, Mendoza subsequently voted in favour of a measure that abolished the death penalty. None of these footages or contexts were used in the Declaration, which blatantly misrepresents the representative position of the opposition. We value it pants on fire!
