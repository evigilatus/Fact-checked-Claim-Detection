Roy Cooper has cast his opponent as a threat to public schools.\nAnd in last week\u2019s gubernatorial debate, Cooper said Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest would allow \"rich\" families to use public tax dollars on a private school education.\n\"What Dan Forest really wants to do with our schools is starve them for funding, then use those tax dollars to help rich people send their kids to private school using vouchers,\" Cooper said.\nCooper made a similar claim during a September online forum about education issues.\nCooper said Forest \"has one goal for our public schools: Starve them for funding, then use those tax dollars to help rich people send their kids to private schools using vouchers. That\u2019s right. Not only does he support vouchers, but he also wants to take the income limits off.\"\u00a0\nIs it true that Forest wants to use tax dollars to help \"rich people\" send their kids to private school?\nWhen reached by PolitiFact, Forest didn\u2019t reject that idea.\nA controversial program\nCooper is talking about Forest\u2019s plan to modify Opportunity Scholarships, which are part of a state government program that offers financial aid to families who want their child to enroll in a participating nonpublic school.\u00a0\nThe program has been controversial since its inception in 2013, with opponents saying it takes public dollars and spends them on private schools that may use religious-based curricula. In 2015, the North Carolina Supreme Court supported the program\u2019s constitutionality in a 4-3 decision.\nSince then, lawmakers have increased the program\u2019s funding while Cooper has proposed phasing out the program.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of now, the grants can be as high as $4,200 per year and they\u2019re only available to low-income families. To receive the full amount under the current plan, a household of four must earn less than $48,470 annually to qualify.\nWe asked the Cooper campaign what he meant when he said Forest would open the program to \"rich\" families. Cooper campaign spokeswoman Liz Doherty said Cooper was referring to Forest\u2019s support for eligibility expansion.\nForest\u2019s position\nForest made headlines last year when he announced that he supports opening the program to every family in North Carolina.\u00a0\nHe has released videos praising the program, pointing to the positive aspects of an evaluation conducted by N.C. State University that said it found test score increases among voucher recipients were \"positive, large, and statistically significant.\"\nForest\u2019s campaign website says he wants to \"expand the eligibility criteria to allow every family in North Carolina the chance to choose a school that works for them.\"\u00a0\nTo ensure that poor people get grants before rich people, Forest says he would institute a \"weighted lottery system.\"\nWe asked the Forest campaign for more details on how Forest\u2019s lottery system would work. We also asked why Forest believes the scholarships should be available to high-income families.\nSpokesman Andrew Dunn said the campaign would not be responding.\nOur ruling\nCooper said Forest wants to use tax dollars \"to help rich people send their kids to private school using vouchers.\"\nCooper was referring to the fact that Forest has said he wants to make North Carolina\u2019s Opportunity Scholarship program available to \"every family in North Carolina.\"\nThat language suggests high-income families could access the funds. However, Forest says he\u2019d implement a weighted lottery system to ensure low-income families have the best chance of accessing funds. It\u2019s unclear how that system would work.\u00a0\nCooper\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, specifically Forest\u2019s stated intent to give preference to poor families.
