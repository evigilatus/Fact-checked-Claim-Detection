In all, 29 states (and a range of cities) have set a higher minimum wage, but in remainder of the country, the $7.25 federal floor prevails.\nBiden, for his part, has expressed clear support for raising the minimum wage to $15, saying on his campaign website that he would \"increase the federal minimum wage to $15.\" Biden reiterated this position during the final presidential debate on Oct. 22 when moderator Kristen Welker of NBC News asked about it.\n\"Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You of course support a $15 federal minimum wage,\" Welker said at the debate.\n\"I do,\" Biden responded.\nDuring this exchange, Trump interjected, offering a position that wasn\u2019t as clear-cut in favor of a wage hike as Biden\u2019s was, but that also didn\u2019t close the door on it.\nTrump expressed concern that the wage hike could result in employers laying off lower-wage employees.\n\"How are you helping your small businesses when you\u2019re forcing wages? What\u2019s going to happen, and what\u2019s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees,\" Trump said.\nTrump added his preference for state-by-state minimum wages. \"Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option.\" (It\u2019s worth noting that no change would be required for this to happen, since states can already set a minimum wage higher than the federal level.)\nThat said, Trump added that he\u2019d \"consider it to an extent \u2026 in a second administration. But not to a level that\u2019s going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2019 minimum wage bill\nOne thing that\u2019s clear is that the White House officially opposed a bill to enact $15 minimum wage in 2019.\u00a0\nThat came when the House was considering H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act. All but six Democrats voted for the measure while only three Republicans voted for it. The bill would phase in a $15 minimum wage over a seven-year period.\nAs the measure was being considered in the House, the White House weighed in, as White Houses often do on major pieces of legislation, in a document known as a Statement of Administration Policy.\nThe administration wrote that a $15 an hour minimum wage would \"reverse\" recent economic progress \"and hurt workers. \u2026 The successful efforts to reduce taxes, eliminate regulations, and implement fairer trade deals are driving economic growth and increasing workers\u2019 take-home pay far more effectively and efficiently than legislation like H.R. 582, which would eliminate jobs and reduce total wages for American workers.\"\nThe document concluded that \"if H.R. 582 were presented to the president in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.\"\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry to clarify the president\u2019s current position.\nA final note: Some economic commentators, including some who ordinarily lean liberal, have previously told PolitiFact that Trump has a point on geographic variations. They suggest that while a $15 minimum wage may be justified in metropolitan areas with high costs of living, it would be disruptive to the economy in lower-cost areas, with up to half of workers getting a raise, potentially resulting in job losses and inflation.\nBiden\u2019s statements have not directly addressed the question of whether it would support regional variations in a minimum wage bill, and his campaign did not clarify that point to PolitiFact. The bill that passed the House did not have a mechanism for regional variations.\nOur ruling\nBiden said Trump \"thinks that $15 an hour minimum wage is too much for essential workers.\"\u00a0\nTrump has expressed skepticism about a $15 minimum wage in the past, and his administration issued clear opposition to a $15 minimum wage bill that passed the House in 2019.\nHowever, in the debate held just a few days before Biden\u2019s comment, Trump did say that he\u2019d \"consider it to an extent \u2026 in a second administration.\"\nTrump never spoke about people not deserving a wage, and he never specifically mentioned essential workers. His concern was that minimum wage increases could lead to job losses.\u00a0\nWe rate Biden\u2019s statement Half True.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18828"}
