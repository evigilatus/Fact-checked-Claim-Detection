It is part of a broader discussion about the UW system that can best attract and retain senior faculty members -- specifically, how to compete with what other universities offer. In its budget proposal 2019-21, Jove. Tony Evers called for a 2 per cent wage increase for UW employees each fiscal year. That was less than the 3% requested by the president of the university system, Ray Cross. However, on May 28, 2019, the Republicans in the Legislative Budget Committee cut total expenditure on the UW system by more than half. The plan continues to provide an increase over current levels, but means that the funds available to address issues related to the wage gap will be lower. Two days before the vote, on 26 May 2019, Cross appeared on \"Up Front\" in WISN, and presented his case for increased wages in an interview with the host Adrian Pedersen. \"Most research shows that we're a little late, and some regions we're behind more,\" he said. \"But compensation is an important part of the total package to make the university part of the solution for the State.\" Is Cross right that WW's salaries are retarded in peer institutions? Let's take a look. :: Peer institutions in higher education, the term peer institution shows much. In short, there is another school - or group of schools - that is similar in size, performance and function. The idea is that it provides a good comparison when it comes to salaries, benefits and other matters. In Wisconsin, the UW system actually has an official list of counterpart institutions. The Commission was established in 1984 by the Governor &apos; s Commission for the Study of Compensation in the College, which was then established in Goff. Tony Earl, Democrat. The list includes 11 counterpart institutions of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the lead in the state; 14 fellows at the University of Wisconsin-Miloki, also considered a research institution; and 31 counterpart institutions of the so-called \"inclusive institutions.\" The institutions of the University of Western Europe are four-year campuses in Iaw Claire, Gulf of Green, La Cross, Oshkosh, Plattville, River Falls, Stevens Point, Superior and Whitewater, as well as UW-Stout in Menomoni, UW-Parkside in Kinusha Province. The counterpart institutions at Madison University include: Indiana University, Michigan State University, Ohio State University, Bordeaux University and Texas-Osten University. These include the counterpart institutions of the Union for the University of Cleveland, the University of Temple, the University of Illinois-Chicago, the University of New Orleans and the University of Texas-Dallas. At the same time, counterpart institutions of the other group include: Minnesota-Manakato State University, Michigan Central University, Chicago State University, North Iowa University and Grand Valley State University in Michigan. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" By Haley Bimler, January 26, 2012, when we requested support from Cross, his staff guided us to the Wiesconsin University Accountability System board. The UW system maintains the online dashboard with links to various statistical information, including a page dedicated to the \"Compensation Gap in the College.\" When it comes to comparisons, salaries are adjusted by cost of living using the index of the Institute of Economic Research. That's good because it helps even compare. These benefits are not included. The American Association of University Teachers provides salary information. How late is it? Maps of the dashboard cover the compensation gap from 2009-2010 to 2017-2018. For the period 2017-2018, graphs show that the generally delayed wages in UW are equivalents of 16.48 per cent. More than that, UW-Madison is 15.60 per cent delayed; UW-Milwaki is 10.82 per cent delayed; and the other university ban is 18.99 per cent delayed. In the previous academic year, 2016-2017, the compensation gap for UW 19.91 per cent, UW-Madison 19.15 per cent, UW-Milwauke 12.67 per cent and UW-W-security 22.65 per cent. So, the difference is slightly smaller than the previous year, but the gaps are all long-term. Other comparisons1 from the US report TODAWORK-Wisconsin of 4 March 2012 using salary information in the period 2017-18 showed that a handful of professors, particularly in the finance and economics departments, were among the highest paid employees in the system. These salaries tend to rise because of the need to compete with private sector jobs. In total, today's U.S. network report - Wisconsin - found that faculty members across the UW system were paid an average of 12.3 per cent less in 2017-2018 than members of counterpart universities. This gap rose to 16.5 per cent when adjusted for cost of living. This corresponds to what the UW system found in its own analysis. * (click here for an online database where readers can search and sort by paying, campus and employee name.) At the same time, an analysis by a senior policy analyst at Madison University, published on April 11, 2018, concluded that the average salary at Madison University was 12th among its counterparts for full professors, 7th among associate professors and 9th among assistant professors. Our governor Cross said, \"Most of the research shows that UW salaries are a little behind, and in (V) some areas we're behind more than others.\" The Cross Foundation indicated that it was a well-established institution. The salary figures show that it is on target, even when cost-of-living differences between different states and cities are calculated. We value his claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00533"}
