The member of the Democratic Senate from New York is a co-sponsor of a bill calling for a 1 per cent tax and another tax at varying rates of up to 5 per cent. \"I think we can easily tax transactions,\" said Gilbert, former securities attorney and presidential candidate, a group gathered at the New Hampshire Policy Institute. \"So, I think a transaction tax, pennies on a hundred dollars, is such a small amount of money. The only industry that will hurt or disrupt it is the fast-trade industry, which I do not think actually creates value. But it also creates huge amounts of revenue. Other States such as the United Kingdom have already done so, and have never influenced their financial markets. Gilbrand said the tax would generate about $77 billion a year. The Budget Office of Congress has found that over a period of 10 years, a 1 per cent transaction tax will generate $777 billion, although other researchers have come up with different income estimates. No new idea of transaction taxes has been used in other countries, and the United States had a tax on stock issuance and transfer transactions from 1914 to 1966. There have been some calls in Congress and elsewhere in recent years to return them, and Gillibrand is not the only presidential candidate who prefers them. The United Kingdom has had \"sealing fees\" since 1694, and is currently taxing 5.5 per cent on securities issued by companies registered in the United Kingdom, although the original issue is exempt. There are several other exemptions. Many countries have enacted some kind of financial transaction tax, and some have abandoned it. A paper on transaction taxes in various countries, published in 1994 and written by economists from Harvard University John E. Campbell and Kenneth A. Fruit, indicates that experiences with these types of taxes are \"very diverse.\" Since Gillibrand mentioned the United Kingdom, we focused our research there. Did that affect the markets? We approached the Gilbrand campaign for more information about her claim, and her spokesman Meredith Kelly said that \"the economy and the United Kingdom stock exchange are flourishing.\" Kelly sent us two pieces of evidence to support the Senator's statement, including a paper in the National Tax Journal that says that \"many of the world's financial centres,\" including the United Kingdom, \"screaming despite\" taxes on financial transactions. An author of that paper, Leonard Borman, a professor at Syracuse University and co-founder of the Centre for Tax Policy, wrote in an e-mail that Gilbrand's claim \"seems to be exaggerated.\" He wrote that taxes on financial transactions had \"surely reduced the volume of trade,\" adding that the decline in the volume of trade was something like tax supporters. The other piece of evidence that Kelly sent was an opinion column written by Jared Bernstein in 2015, who was an economic advisor to former Vice President Joe Biden. Bernstein wrote that he would prefer a transaction tax in the United States as a means of increasing revenue while limiting trade that makes markets volatile. However, he wrote that \"historic evidence\" of whether transaction taxes raise or reduce market volatility is \"uncritical.\" Several studies of the effects of the transaction tax in the United Kingdom have highlighted market volatility, stock prices and investor behaviour. While some market effects have been found, supporters of the tax note that the London market is still strong. On January 14, 2021, Colin Schmidt mentioned at a press conference \"We have scientific data, from all levels, but especially from high school sports levels, from many different states, which show that it's safe to play what New York is thinking of doing very dangerous mathematics.\" Campbell and Frot wrote that the tax in the United Kingdom \"cannot be avoided through overseas trade but stimulates trade\" in other non-taxable financial instruments and \"also seems to reduce the total volume of trade to some extent.\" Another paper, published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2011, found that the market for some sort of derivative instrument, known in the United Kingdom as \"team contracts,\" \"has grown rapidly since its inception in the early 1990s, partly because it was exempt from stamp duties.\" The author, Economist Thornton Matheson, wrote that the United Kingdom's transaction tax is often \"considered to be successful\" because of the amount of revenue it collects. A 2004 paper by the British Financial Research Institute concluded that postage charges lower prices, which could increase the cost of capital to companies, and distorted how investors interpreted the equity price as an indicator of the company's profitability. A paper prepared in 2007 by United Kingdom Economic Advisor Oxera defended tax abolition, claiming that stamp charges made capital more expensive, up to 12 per cent in some sectors. Like other studies, the authors found that investors had selected non-tax financial instruments to avoid stamp charges. A 1997 study by the Bank of England concluded that postage charges did not affect fluctuations in the United Kingdom. Those who support a transaction tax note by the United States note that the London Stock Exchange is strong and that the tax generates significant revenue. Sarah Anderson, Director of the World Economy Project at the Progressive Institute of Policy Studies, said that the London Stock Exchange could flourish even in the face of uncertainty, Prexit. Another supporter of a transaction tax in the United States, economist Robert Boleyn, said that the tax \"did not prevent the London City market from operating on a massive scale.\" \"It is true that the volume of daily trade in the UK market is somewhat lower than in Wall Street,\" said Pauline, co-director of the Institute for Political Economics Research at Massachusetts Amherst University. \"This may be due to the financial transaction tax. But it's really hard to fix that one way or another.\" Our Governor Gillibrand said that the transaction tax did not affect the UK's financial markets \"at all.\" The tax has been in effect for centuries and the London Stock Exchange remains a strong financial centre. However, the imposition of a tax is likely to have some impact, and studies have concluded that the price of shares and the volume of trade are influenced by taxes.
