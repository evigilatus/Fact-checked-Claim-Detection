Bernie Sanders riffed on the theme for which he is perhaps best known: economic inequality.\nSanders told the cheering crowd that, if elected, he plans to pay for his many proposals \u2014 including making public colleges and universities tuition-free and wiping out student debt \u2014 with his recently proposed wealth tax.\nHe said this is \"a time of massive and grotesque income and wealth inequality in America.\"\n\"49% of all new income goes to the top 1%,\" Sanders said while ticking off his usual talking points on the gap between the nation\u2019s richest and everyone else \u2014 some of which we\u2019ve checked before \u2014 and promising that if he is elected, \"the billionaire class and the large, profitable corporations will start paying their fair share of taxes.\"\nWhile mulling a presidential run in early 2015, Sanders used a considerably more stark version of the same claim, contending almost all income growth at the time was going to the top 1%. We rated that Mostly True, finding Sanders had accurately represented a somewhat limited, though widely cited research study based on federal tax data.\nBut the discrepancy between Sanders\u2019 new figure \u2014 which refers to income growth \u2014 and the one from a few years ago gave us pause, so we decided to take a closer look. It turns out his latest statement relates to an updated edition of the same study. Once again, he cited it accurately. Just like last time, however, there are several caveats worth keeping in mind.\nDifferent ways to assess income\nSanders based his claim on the latest update to a study from Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who uses pre-tax income reported in Internal Revenue Service filings to compare top income dating back to 1913. As Saez\u2019s report notes, it\u2019s the only data source that stretches back that far.\nIn his March update, Saez highlights his finding that average inflation-adjusted family income grew by 14% from 2009 to 2017, the latest year for which IRS data is available. But growth in the wake of the Great Recession was uneven, he notes, with the incomes of the top 1% rising 38% while the incomes of the bottom 99% grew only 8.7%.\n\"Hence, the top 1% captured 49% of the income gains during this recovery period,\" Saez concluded. That backs up the figure Sanders used.\nBut Saez\u2019s work does not include income received from government programs such as Social Security, food stamps and unemployment compensation, or health insurance benefits. Other studies that do account for these significant income factors, along with after-tax income \u2014 including one performed by Saez \u2014 suggest a more narrow gap in income growth.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Rauner\n\n\nstated on June 1, 2016 in a press conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago in Illinois ...\u00a0because of the control of (House) Speaker (Michael) Madigan and his Democrats.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Matt Dietrich \u2022 July 13, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause Saez\u2019s calculations are based on pre-tax income, his work doesn\u2019t account for the other way in which the federal government redistributes earnings \u2014 by requiring the wealthy to pay a heftier share in taxes. That\u2019s particularly relevant here, given that Sanders was speaking about the need to hike taxes on the very rich.\n\"If you want to have a comprehensive measure of how Americans pay their bills, we\u2019ve got to add all sources of income and we have to subtract the taxes that are taken out of our pay before we even get it,\" said economist Gary Burtless, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nIn a report published last year, Urban Institute economist Stephen Rose surveyed a collection of recent studies on income inequality, highlighting how differences in methodology \"greatly affect findings\" and identifying the Saez series Sanders cited as the clear outlier.\nThe Saez report Sanders drew from also takes as its starting point the end of one of the nation\u2019s worst economic slumps. Experts told us that\u2019s an important point to keep in mind because the country\u2019s top earners experienced the biggest percentage of income declines during the recession, meaning the gains they registered during the first few years of the recovery as the stock market began to bounce back were especially large but are now growing more slowly by comparison.\nOur ruling\nSanders said \"49% of all new income goes to the top 1%.\"\nThat\u2019s a reference to growth in pre-tax, pre-government benefit income during the economic recovery following the Great Recession from 2009 to 2017, which was calculated by one of the leading experts in the field of income inequality research.\nHowever, it\u2019s not the only way to measure income, and other economists we spoke with pointed to more comprehensive, though slightly more dated, studies that compare income growth after accounting for what people pay to and receive from the government.\nWe rate Sanders\u2019 claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2014 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00112"}
