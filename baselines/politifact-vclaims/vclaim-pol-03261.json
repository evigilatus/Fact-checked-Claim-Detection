Claire McCaskill issued a\u00a0news release\u00a0urging president Trump to address the issue of steel dumping.\n\n\nMcCaskill backed up her comments by saying, \"Due to the recent downturn in steel production, more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off and the steel industry is facing billions in losses.\"\n\n\nThose are some big numbers McCaskill threw out there, so we set out to see if they were accurate. What we found may be worse than what McCaskill originally thought.\n\n\nJobs are going away\n\n\nThe first part of Sen. McCaskill\u2019s statement, \"More than 13,600 Americans have been laid off,\" is accurate. When PolitiFact Missouri asked McCaskill\u2019s office for the supporting data, her press secretary offered a spreadsheet from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 website tracking the amount of steel mill jobs on a monthly basis.\n\n\nHer press secretary said the 13,600 figure was between January 2015 and May 2016.\n\n\nIn January 2015, 153,500 Americans were employed in steel mills. By May 2016, that number had fallen to 139,900.\n\n\nBut it\u2019s important to note that the loss of steel jobs in America isn\u2019t a recent trend. In fact, more than 20,000 steel jobs have been lost in the U.S. since the start of 2007. Historical data paint a grim picture of the state of steel jobs in America.\n\n\nAccording to the BLS, all \"primary metals\" jobs have dropped from 688,000 in 1990 to just 379,000 by March of 2017. In other words, in the past 27 years, nearly half of the metal-related jobs in America have been eliminated.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are jobs disappearing?\n\n\nA common reason offered as to why steel jobs are leaving is that countries, primarily China, participate in \"steel dumping.\" Dumping is when a country sells goods outside its home market for a cheaper rate than they are sold in the home country. Despite dumping being illegal since the 1940s, it remains an issue in the steel industry.\n\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen pretty significant job loss, which we believe is attributable to the global trade problem,\" said Kevin Dempsey, the senior vice president for public policy at the American Iron and Steel Institute. \"There\u2019s a big crisis with massive steel overcapacity. High levels of imports have led to (U.S.) steel mills being shut down.\"\n\n\nDempsey said efforts to address the issue have been underway for some time. The issue was a hot topic at last year\u2019s G20 summit. And a global forum on steel access capacity meets on a regular basis as it tries to stop the \"underlying policy problems\" facing the country, according to Dempsey. Trump is\u00a0expected to sign an executive order\u00a0barring steel dumping.\n\n\n\"It\u2019s really tough going because no country wants to bear all the pain of that,\" Dempsey said. \"China is reluctant to make changes, but we\u2019re going to continue on pressing to change that.\"\n\n\nWhat kind of shape is the steel industry in?\n\n\nThe second part of McCaskill\u2019s claim states: \"The steel industry is facing billions in losses.\" While McCaskill\u2019s press secretary did not offer data on the profit losses of the steel industry, our own research paints a dark picture.\n\n\nSteel dumping has crushed the profits of the U.S. steel industry. Low demand and large debt burdens are also challenging domestic producers.\n\n\nUS Steel revenues went from $17.5 billion in 2014 to $11.5 billion in 2015.\u00a0Revenue declined 13 percent at Steel Dynamics. Labor relations problems cut Allegheny Technologies\u2019 bottom line in 2015. The list of companies that have lost significant money in the steel industry goes on and on.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nMcCaskill said, \"Due to the recent downturn in steel production, more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off and the steel industry is facing billions in losses.\" Both parts of the senator\u2019s statements have been proven accurate as forces like steel dumping have led to job cuts and billions of dollars of losses in America.
