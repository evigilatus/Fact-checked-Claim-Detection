He didn\u2019t write it.\u00a0\n\"HOORAY FOR BUBBA WATSON,\" begins the post, which has been copied and pasted widely. \"He put into words what I think most of us are feeling.\"\u00a0\nIt goes on to quote Watson who supposedly begins by saying: \"I\u2019m so confused right now. I see signs all over saying black lives matter. I\u2019m just trying to figure out which black lives matter. It can\u2019t be unborn black babies. They are destroyed without a second thought. It\u2019s not black cops. They don\u2019t seem to matter. It\u2019s not my black conservative friends. They are told to shut up if they know what\u2019s best for them by their black counterparts.\"\nIt goes on at length, ending with a prayer for God to \"heal our land and bless the United States of America.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

In his own, actual words, he said: \"I\u2019m not sure how or why my name ended up on the Facebook post, but it ain\u2019t from me. Someone decided to pretend it was from me and I guess it took off. It\u2019s unfortunate how things like this spread online. I hope this is a good reminder to be careful what you believe on the internet.\"\nWe didn\u2019t find any statements by Watson about Black Lives Matter that drew news coverage. In 2012, Watson, the owner of \"General Lee\" \u2014 the car from the TV show \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" that had the image of the Confederate flag on its roof \u2014\u00a0expressed disappointment when NASCAR canceled plans to have the golfer drive the vehicle on a parade lap before a race, saying, \"Obviously, I don\u2019t stand for the Confederate flag.\"\nA few years later, Watson painted over the Confederate flag from the roof.\u00a0\n\"All men ARE created equal, I believe that so I will be painting the American flag over the roof of the General Lee,\" he tweeted.\nIn June, he said he\u2019d like to donate the car to a museum.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17047"}
