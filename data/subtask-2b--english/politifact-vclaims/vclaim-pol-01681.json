Hegar of Round Rock says as much about the Republican she\u2019s challenging to represent the state\u2019s 31st Congressional District, eight-term Rep. John Carter of Round Rock. The district, north of Austin,\u00a0sweeps in Williamson and Bell counties.\nHegar, a decorated Air Force veteran, has promoted her candidacy with a video in which she says that she once tried but failed to land a meeting with Carter about lifting the ban on women to participate in ground combat. \"We\u2019ll show him tough,\" Hegar says in the video. \"Then we\u2019ll show him the door.\"\nHegar said of Carter in an Aug. 21, 2018 interview on Spectrum News's \"Capital Tonight:\" \"He hasn\u2019t had a town hall in five years and he\u2019s kind of acting as if he wants to retire.\"\nHegar points to news stories\nWe sought Hegar\u2019s factual backup for her claim mindful that Merriam-Webster defines a town hall as \"an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members.\" The dictionary makes clear that such a gathering doesn\u2019t have to enable anyone to ask anything. Merriam-Webster follows the definition with this sample sentence: \"Town halls have lost some of their spontaneity. The 80 or so undecided voters chosen for Tuesday's event must submit their questions in advance and moderator Candy Crowley of CNN will decide which people to call on.\"\nChristian Walker of Hegar\u2019s campaign pointed us to a Texas Observer article describing a 2013 town-hall meeting where Carter faced critical questions.\nWalker also singled out a\u00a0February 2017 Austin American-Statesman news story quoting a Round Rock resident, Felicia Miyakawa, saying Carter\u2019s staff had told her and others that Carter hadn\u2019t hosted live town hall meetings since the shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., at a public meeting with constituents in 2011. Carter spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer responded at the time: \"I wouldn\u2019t say that is \u2018the\u2019 reason, but it would be correct to say it contributes to the many reasons. Mostly town halls are not nearly as effective, and you can\u2019t reach nearly as many people as a tele-town hall.\"\nOne alternative: Mass conference calls. The American-Statesman story said: \"Many members of Congress prefer the safety of tele-town hall meetings, which offer interaction with constituents but in a controlled setting \u2014 essentially large-scale conference calls in which hundreds or thousands of people can listen in and queue up to ask a question \u2014 with no booing, no signs with clever slogans, no bad headlines, no viral videos.\"\nCarter held an hour-long tele-town hall on March 22, 2017, according to an American-Statesman\u00a0news blog post. More recently, an Aug. 11, 2018,\u00a0news story\u00a0in the newspaper said Carter had reached out to residents through Facebook Live events.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarter: \u2018Man of the people\u2019\nWhen we asked Carter about Hegar\u2019s claim, he said by phone that he\u2019d held multiple events attended by people asking questions. \"I\u2019ve been all over my district now, for 12- to 14-hour days, which is pretty typical of my work in Augusts each year. I would say I\u2019m way ahead of my opponent in the Man-of-the-People category,\" Carter said.\nWhen we inquired into Carter\u2019s formal schedule, we heard back from his office\u2019s Emily Taylor. By email, Taylor listed four August 2018 events where, she said, Carter took questions from constituents on topics including federal pensions, Fort Hood and the legalization of marijuana. The events, Taylor said, were hosted by the Temple Kiwanis Club (Aug. 7); American Legion Post 133 (Aug. 14); the Military Officers Association of America (Aug. 17); and the Killeen Chamber of Commerce (Aug. 23). An Aug. 14, 2018 Temple Daily Telegram news story on the American Legion event includes a section titled \"Town Hall\" stating that Carter \"took a few minutes to discuss congressional business and field questions from the audience.\"\nWe asked\u00a0if Carter had held public town halls open to all constituents.\nTaylor replied that Carter had hosted 25 telephone town halls in five years, the latest one on June 18, 2018. \"The last four alone have reached 71,471 constituents,\" Taylor wrote.\nAlso, Taylor said, Carter holds Facebook Live \"town halls, where constituents can tune in online and ask real-time questions or submit questions on our website if they\u2019re unable to tune in during the live event.\" She pointed us to a nearly 20-minute Facebook Live that Carter held July 2, 2018. Such events are publicized, Taylor wrote, through Carter\u2019s electronic newsletters.\nOur ruling\nHegar said Carter \"hasn\u2019t held a town hall in five years.\"\nAs Hegar maintained, it looks like Carter hasn't\u00a0hosted a traditional in-person town hall any time recently. Yet he holds tele-town halls, makes Facebook Live appearances and talks at meetings hosted by local groups.\nWe rate this\u00a0claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
