We recovered from a global economic collapse. I could go on. But @JoeBiden was there too. Fighting.\u2014 Nate McMurray (@Nate_McMurray) September 10, 2019 \nImmigration continues to be a topic that Americans care about and candidates talk about, so we wanted to see if McMurray is correct. His instruction to \"look it up\" struck us as an invitation for a factcheck.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat the Grand Island supervisor meant by \"illegal immigration\" remains unclear. His spokesperson did not clarify it for us. Demographers who study immigration look at data from several sources to get a sense of how many people cross the border illegally and how many enter legally but then overstay their visas. They also look at how the population of people who live in the United States without authorization changes over time. That number rises and falls as more undocumented immigrants enter the country while others die, become citizens or leave the country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMcMurray responded to a Twitter user asking for evidence of his claim, and he tweeted the link to a report from the pro-immigration Center for Migration Studies.\u00a0\nIn the report, \"The U.S. Undocumented Population Fell Sharply During the Obama Era: Estimates for 2016,\" author Robert Warren found that the population of undocumented people fell to 10.8 million in 2016, Obama's last full year in office, the lowest level since 2003.\u00a0\nThe report does not go back 50 years. It does show that the undocumented population was once much lower. Using data on 18 countries that account for 88 percent of the undocumented population, the report shows that in 1990, the undocumented population was 3.5 million, and in 2000 it was 8.6 million.\u00a0\nAnother study, from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, found that the population of unauthorized immigrants peaked in 2007, before Obama took office,\u00a0at 12.2 million and fell to 10.5 million in 2017, just after he left the presidency.\u00a0\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses a different methodology to count the number of unauthorized immigrants, and it estimates that on average, that number grew by 70,000 people every year between 2010 and 2015. DHS estimates that 12 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the United States in January 2015, compared to 11.5 million in January 2014 and 11.6 million in January 2010, according to a report published in December.\u00a0\nNot a perfect measure\nWe interviewed five people who study immigration trends, some from think tanks with different viewpoints on immigration and others who conduct research but do not take positions on policy. Many of these experts use government data on apprehensions of people who are in the United States without authorization to measure illegal immigration, though they warned that data is not a perfect measure.\u00a0\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports that yearly apprehensions of aliens, which the department defines as people who are not citizens or nationals, was as low as 462,388 under Obama in 2015. The highest number of apprehensions during Obama\u2019s presidency was 889,212 in 2009. This figure includes apprehensions by U.S. Border Patrol and administrative arrests by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Before 2015, the department recorded lower apprehensions 44 years earlier. In 1971, 420,126 apprehensions were recorded. After Obama left office, the number of apprehensions fell lower still. In 2017, President Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office, apprehensions fell to 461,540.\u00a0\nThe U.S. Border Patrol also reports its yearly apprehensions, which is a subset of the Department of Homeland Security data. Apprehensions at the border during the Obama administration were also lowest in 2015, at 337,117. Before 2015, apprehensions at the border were lower in 1971, with 302,517. In 2017, border apprehensions fell to 310,531.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is at a 50-year low, according to Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, is apprehensions of Mexicans at the southwest border. However, Passel said that though apprehensions of Mexicans at the southwest border are falling, research from Pew shows that people who have likely overstayed their visas have made up a large majority of unauthorized immigrant arrivals since 2010.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral demographers warned that apprehensions are only a rough indicator of illegal immigration, and not just because apprehensions do not reveal the precise number of people who crossed the border without permission and stayed. Research published in January from the Center for Migration Studies found \"visa overstays have significantly exceeded illegal border crossings during each of the last seven years.\"\u00a0\nJessica Vaughan, director of policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration, said there are problems with comparing apprehension data over the last 50 years because of changes in the way U.S. Border Patrol deters illegal border crossings. Decades ago, the same people tried several times before they crossed, she said. She also said that the statistics on the number of apprehensions represents events, not people, and that the same person could be apprehended several times.\u00a0\nWhen we followed up with McMurray\u2019s campaign for further evidence of his claim, his spokeswoman, Nicole Hushla, said that McMurray had heard the statistic on the MSNBC program \"Morning Joe.\" Further questions we had about whether McMurray was talking about apprehensions of undocumented people at the border or about the undocumented population living in the United States were not answered.\u00a0\u00a0\nExperts we spoke with gave mixed opinions about whether McMurray\u2019s claim is accurate.\u00a0\nWarren, who formerly worked for the Census Bureau and has written many research papers that have been widely cited, said in an interview that he believes McMurray\u2019s claim to be \"generally correct,\" based on the same apprehension data.\n\"Actually, if someone wanted to quibble with the statement, undocumented immigration probably was lower in the late 1960s and early 1970s than it was in the later part of the Obama administration; it was higher from the mid-1970s to the later part of the Obama administration \u2013 about 40 years,\" he said.\u00a0\nSome experts said McMurray\u2019s claim is largely correct, based on apprehensions of people seeking to enter the country illegally, particularly of apprehensions at the southern border. Those figures, however, do not include visa overstays, a large source of illegal immigration.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"If you define it to mean the size of the unauthorized immigrant population, that\u2019s not accurate,\" said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Migration Policy Institute, which supports liberal immigration policies. \"The size of the unauthorized population overall in the U.S. was at near-record highs during the start of the Obama administration and while it tapered off somewhat, the population remains vastly larger than it was 50 years ago.\"\u00a0\nA researcher with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports Trump\u2019s immigration policies, noted the size of the population of unauthorized immigrants under Obama. Even when illegal immigration\u00a0was lowest under Obama, that population was still approximately three times larger than it was in 1990, said Spencer Raley, the federation\u2019s senior research associate. Raley also believes that the size of this population is underestimated because the government has trouble collecting accurate data.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\nMcMurray tweeted that during the Obama administration illegal immigration dropped to a 50-year low.\u00a0\nNothing in the data we reviewed shows that to be true.\nDuring Obama\u2019s eight-year presidency, apprehensions of people who were in the country without authorization dropped to levels not seen since 1971.\u00a0Apprehensions are not a precise\u00a0measure of how many individuals enter the country and stay when they are not authorized to do so, and they do not include people who overstay their visas. But immigration researchers do use this data to make estimates about illegal immigration.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut even if McMurray had said apprehensions,\u00a0his statement would have still been problematic. In November 2014, Obama said, \"Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s.\" PolitiFact found his statement to be Half True. While PolitiFact found Obama to be correct on the sheer numbers of people caught trying to cross the border in 2013 and the 1970s, experts noted that Obama created an imperfect comparison because the border situation was far different in 1970 than in 2013. In the 1970s, it was easier for people to make multiple attempts or excursions illegally across the border.\nDemographers use the size of the population of illegal immigrants residing in the United States to measure trends in illegal immigration. This population was much lower decades ago, based on available data, than it was during the Obama administration, though some studies show that this population fell during the last 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate McMurray\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00135"}
