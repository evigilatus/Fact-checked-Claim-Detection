Google manipulated 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election!\" Trump's tweeting. \"This has been put by Clinton's supporters, not Trump's! Google should be sued. \"My victory was bigger than I thought!\" It appears that Trump's claim is due to a search paper published on the Internet in June 2017. Maybe he became aware of the paper after the right-wing site \"Town Hall\" published an article strongly cited. The Washington Post stated that the research paper itself was mentioned in part on the Fox Business Network. The paper, prepared by psychologist Robert Epstein, seeks to build on past research conducted by Epstein on how bias in search engine results can influence voting preferences. (For information, Epstein estimated that between 2.6 million and 10.4 million votes might have been manipulated in 2016 - not as many as 16 million votes, as Tramp said. However, a number of the experts with whom we contacted said that the methodology followed by the latter paper was charged with many ills and unexplained assumptions to confirm the type of allegation that Trump claims here. We called Epstein to ask him if he objected to Trump's description of his findings. \"I'm sure of it,\" said Epstein, who supported Clinton in 2016. \"I never said Google deliberately manipulated the 2016 election.\" When we asked about the formula and assumptions that Epstein used to arrive at his basic conclusion, we did not hear a reply. The White House did not respond to the request for comment. The experts noted several major shortcomings in the Epstein paper. First, here is the basic preparation for the study: in the run-up to the 2016 elections, researchers recruited 95 people, 21 of whom were identified as \"unimaginable.\" Over a period of 25 days - from 15 October to election day, 8 November - researchers analysed between 50 and 483 daily online research on these topics. These research findings were then sent to a website dedicated to the public, where the sorters voted whether or not they found biased research results. Their main conclusion was that \"the conditions for election research were, on average, biased in favour of Ms. Clinton.\" The experts with whom we spoke cited a range of problems related to this methodology. On January 17, 2021, in an interview with Fox News, President Donald Trump said, \"He can't say anything (about the riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms removed it.\" By Bill McCarthy on January 18, 2021, one of the common complaints was the lack of definitions. \"They can't even identify biased research results -- they simply moved them to a crowd source site and asked people randomly, \"Is this the research results page biased or not?\" said Ryan Single, a media and strategic colleague at the Stanford Law School Center for the Internet and Society. \"What does that even mean?\" The search results were also abandoned by researchers from users who run the Gmail accounts, after finding that these users &apos; research yielded less biased results. For researchers, this raised concerns that \"Joggle may have identified our trusted through the e-mail system and targeted them for unbiased results.\" However, others questioned that interpretation. \"They removed anyone using the Gmail address because their research results were not considered 'biased,' guessing that Google was intentionally poisoning their research,\" said Sengel. \"This is both funny and sad.\" Apart from methodological flaws, others objected to the assumption by researchers about the quality of translating an experiment of this kind into a voting booth. For some, gaps in the unexplained definitions and formulas used for extrapolation created more questions than answers. We called Nicholas Diacopolous, a professor of communications and computer science at Northwestern University, to ask how researchers could get 25 days of research results from 95 subjects to millions of manipulated voices. \"There's not enough information in the white paper on how to make an estimate,\" said Diacopolous. It was likely that researchers had developed a mathematical formula that sought to translate examples of the bias they had collected into voter impact assessments. \"But again there is not enough information in the white paper to say conclusively how their \"calculational model\" works,\" and he said, \"If it is a correct estimate based on the assumptions made in the model.\" Google refuted Tramp's statement, pointing out that it was an old claim. \"The claim of this inaccurate researcher has been dismantled since it was made in 2016,\" said Google spokesman in a statement. \"As we said then, we did not rearrange or change the results of the research to manipulate political emotions.\" The Governor Trump said we have a new report showing \"Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 elections.\" The general idea here is that Google gave people research results that somehow affected their vote in the run-up to the President's election. Whether these indirect interactions can lead people to change their voices is questionable, and the paper - which is not new - does nothing to determine how that can happen. The paper does not explain its methodology, and other academics questioned whether its results were correct. Finally, Trump seems to have exaggerated the external limit of questionable results. Anyway, we're evaluating his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00253"}
