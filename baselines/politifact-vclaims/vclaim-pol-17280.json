I\u2019m hearing that, and that is terrific. That\u2019s a very powerful vaccine in itself,\" said Trump, who was responding to a reporter\u2019s question about what his message to the American people was as the holidays approach and levels of COVID cases in the U.S. continue to rise.\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Trump had given credence to the idea that if enough people in a population gain immunity to a disease by being exposed to it, the illness won\u2019t be able to spread through the remainder of the population \u2014 a concept known as \"herd immunity.\"\nHowever, experts have warned that attempting to achieve herd immunity naturally, by allowing people to get sick with COVID-19, could result in more than a million deaths and potentially long-term health problems for many. A better way to achieve protection across the population, experts say, is through widespread vaccination.\nSo, we thought it was important to check whether 15% is anywhere close to the herd immunity threshold, and whether this level of natural immunity could be considered \"as powerful as a vaccine.\"\n15% is nowhere close\nThe White House did not respond to our request for more information about the comment or about Trump\u2019s 15% figure.\nIt may be derived from a Nov. 25 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report using mathematical models to estimate that 53 million Americans \u2014 about 16% of the population \u2014 have likely been infected with COVID-19. Those models took into consideration the nation\u2019s number of confirmed cases, and then used existing data to calculate estimates of the number of people who had COVID-19 but didn\u2019t seek medical attention, weren\u2019t able to access a COVID-19 test, received a false-negative test result or were asymptomatic and unaware they had COVID-19.\nIt\u2019s important to note this estimate is based on data from February through September \u2014 and we\u2019re now in mid-December, so the share of Americans who have been infected with the coronavirus would likely be much higher. For instance, an independent data scientist, Youyang Gu, estimated that 17.5% of Americans have had COVID-19 as of Nov. 30. His estimate is published on his website, COVID Projections.\nExperts have said that a 15% infection rate among Americans is nowhere close to the threshold needed to reach herd immunity against COVID.\n\"To get to herd immunity, an estimated 60-80% of people need to have immunity (either through natural infection or through the vaccine),\" Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University, wrote in an email. \"We are a very long way off from that.\"\nAlso, Wen said, scientists still don\u2019t know enough about how effective natural immunity is in defending against COVID-19. It appears that once someone has had COVID-19 and recovered, the antibodies their body produced can protect them for at least several months. But, there have also been reports of COVID-19 re-infection.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why medical experts urge everyone to get vaccinated, whether they have had COVID-19 or not.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently set the saturation level for herd immunity even higher \u2014 between 75% and 80% \u2014 in an interview with Axios.\nAt that point, he said, \"you create an umbrella of herd immunity \u2014 that even though there is virus around, it is really almost inconsequential because it has no place to go, because almost all of the people are protected.\"\nBoth the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have shown 95% effectiveness at protecting people from developing COVID-19 in clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized Pfizer\u2019s vaccine for emergency use. This Thursday, an independent panel will consider whether to recommend that the FDA authorize the emergency use of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine.\nSo, that leads to the next question: Is 15% natural immunity among the American population anywhere close to a \"powerful vaccine,\" as Trump alleges?\nNo, said the experts. And there\u2019s nothing \"terrific\" about that level of infection within the community.\n\"Fifteen percent \u2018natural immunity\u2019 is nowhere close to as powerful as a vaccine,\" Dr. Rachel Vreeman, director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, wrote in an email.\nAssuming that natural immunity is effective, reaching a level of 15% of the population would prevent only those individuals who have had COVID from getting sick again, said Stephen Morse, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University.\n\"But [it] won\u2019t do much to prevent virus spread in the community, because there are still so many susceptible people,\" Morse wrote in an email. Plus, 15% of the American population having had COVID-19 \"has come at a high cost,\" Morse wrote. To achieve 15% natural immunity, more than 300,000 people in the U.S. have been sacrificed.\nOur ruling\nThough Trump was in the ballpark when he referenced the share of Americans who have been infected with the coronavirus, his overall point -- that the natural immunity these people acquired is a powerful vaccine -- does not hold up. Experts repeatedly have warned that not enough is known about the immunity people appear to gain after recovering from a COVID-19 infection to know how effective or lasting it is. And there have been reported cases of COVID re-infections.\nAlso, experts agree more than 70% of the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated in order to reach herd immunity. Fifteen percent is nowhere close to that threshold and should not be considered as effective as a COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, that 15% statistic brought with it hundreds of thousands of deaths.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17280"}
