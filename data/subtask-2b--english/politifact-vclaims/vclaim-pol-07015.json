PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look.\nGeorgia law allows police officers who witness motorists passing a stopped bus to issue a $1,000 moving violation misdemeanor.\nBut after 5-year-old Karla Campos was killed when a driver sped past her stopped school bus in Cobb County in 2009, parents lobbied lawmakers to allow video cameras to catch violators.\nTheir case was bolstered by a report that Campos was one of five Georgia children to die that year in bus-related accidents. That accounted for 38 percent of the 13 child fatalities occurring in 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to the 2009-2010 National School Bus Loading & Unloading Survey by the Kansas State Department of Education.\nThey included a 7-year-old struck and killed crossing the street with another child to catch his bus. The elderly driver said he couldn\u2019t see the boys because of fog. The 7-year-old\u2019s companion survived.\nGeorgia changed state law in 2011 to allow the installation of video cameras on school buses to catch violators.\nBy the following school year, Cobb and Fayette County schools had already begun arming some of their district buses with cameras.\nAt the time, Cobb estimated that about 1,000 violations occurred per day, or nearly one violation for each bus the district has on the road.\nBy the end of the school year, the Cobb program caught 871 violators using cameras on 102 of the district\u2019s buses. But because the law still required police to issue citations, those motorists only received warnings.\nState lawmakers have since updated the 2011 law to allow the districts or outside vendors to issue violations. Fines are $300 for the first offense and up to $1,000 for the third offense in five years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is evidence that the increased enforcement has cut violations. In April 2013, Cobb filed 1,300 citations. This April, there were 767 citations in the state\u2019s second-largest school district.\nA statewide poll of bus drivers, who reported the number of motorists who blew past a stopped bus, also saw a decline from 8,102 in the 2010-2011 school year to 7,619 last year, according to an annual survey conducted by the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services.\nCarlton Allen, Georgia\u2019s representative to that group, said the new law has helped. So, too, did a blitz by the Governor\u2019s Office of Highway Safety two years ago to focus on the problem.\nBut Georgia still had 13 student deaths during bus loadings and unloadings in the past five years, said Allen, who is director of of pupil transportation services at the Georgia Department of Education.\n\"To me, part of that is the loss of a school bus safety unit in the state patrol and a reduction in our staff,\" Allen said of his office, down to three trainers from seven plus a clerical worker.\nThat leaves it to the local systems to seek other ways to reduce violations, which in Gwinnett numbered 2,000 in a single day.\nAmerican Traffic Solutions, which has taken over the program in Cobb, now sends video of violators to the county police to confirm a violation before they issue a citation.\nIn the metro area, Decatur, Clayton and Marietta schools also use the video cameras. Atlanta and Fulton have signaled they plan to install the devices in the coming year.\nGeorgia at one time did lead the nation in the number of students killed by motorists passing stopped school buses.\nThat was in the 2009-2010 school year, before the state adopted a law allowing video cameras to help tackle the problem.\nThe state has since updated the law to make it easier to ticket offenders. A growing number of school districts have begun using the video cameras as deterrents.\nGeorgia has not had a year as bad as the record-setter of 2009-2010, with five child deaths. But it also has not been fatality-free as more than 40 states are each year.\nEven with the cameras, some motorists remain a problem.\nRoach correctly stated that a study showed Georgia led the nation for bus-related fatalities at the time lawmakers passed a bill allowing the use of the cameras.\nWe rated her statement as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07015"}
