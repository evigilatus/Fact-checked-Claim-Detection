Wolfe, R-10th, was not surprised. In a statement on his website, Wolfe said, referring to his previous warnings that the Great Triangular Credit State Classification was in danger. Wolfe called for a reduction in the level of \"predictable warning,\" adding: \"I have been filming a similar warning for nearly five years and I have tried to draw the attention of Congress and past and current administrations to the fact that America cannot continue its current course of debt and deficit, with more than $14 trillion in debt, more than $62 trillion in unfunded commitments, and more than a trillion in projected deficits for years to come,\" Wolfe added. There's a number one there that failed to ring the bell. We know that the national debt exceeds $14 trillion; indeed, we have recently reached the debt level of $14.3 trillion. It is also true that future deficit projections - under the current budget plan - exceed $1 trillion annually. But is it true that the United States has more than $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities? We thought it was worth a look. For one source, Wolff's office referred to a report issued in 2010 by the Peter J. Peterson Foundation, an organization dedicated to raising public awareness of financial issues. The study contains a table entitled \"Main financial exposure.\" An amount of $61.9 trillion is calculated for 2009, in addition to \"express liabilities\" (public debt, pensions, etc.). \"Obligations and emergencies\" and \"Social insurance promises\" (future social security benefits and future medical care benefits). The largest engine of the impressive total is expected to be social insurance promises, which represent $45.8 trillion - of which $38.2 trillion is future medical care benefits. Social security benefits represent the rest. As noted in accurate publications, projections are derived from the reports of the Secretaries of Social Security and Medical Care dated 1 January 2009 and the estimated benefits over the next 75 years. The rest of the data comes from the 2009 report of the United States Department of the Treasury. First, there is a question of terminology. \" Technically, Mr. Wolfe is mistaken for the lack of social security and medical care 'unfunded responsibilities'\" said J.D. Foster, economist of the Good Heritage Foundation. \"Legally, they are not opponents. They may be referred to precisely as promises or commitments.\" Foster said that benefits were not considered as liabilities because \"the Conference could reduce or change them at any time. On the contrary, government retirement plans are contractual employment arrangements which are obligations because they are legally enforceable.\" Gary Portless, economist with the Brookings Left Foundation, agreed, called the idea that the government \"gives\" trillions of dollars to future citizens from a variety of programs under rules that are actually \"foolish.\" \"The Supreme Court ruled that the United States of America had no contractual obligation to pay social security and medical care under the rules that Congress had no power to change,\" said Bertellis in e-mail. \"No citizen can expect to win a lawsuit claiming generous benefits to the extent of the \"promised\" benefits under a set of old rules that are supposed to be more generous.\" However, we will reduce reductions at this point because the Peterson Foundation report and the media reports we found refer to future social security and medical care benefits as \"liabilities\" rather than \"commitments.\" The following problem is less controversial: information is outdated. According to the latest reports of the Medical Care and Social Security Secretaries, the numbers have changed significantly since 2009. The total medical care benefits promised for the next 75 years now amount to $24.6 trillion, according to 2011 figures, and social security benefits have increased to $9.2 trillion. Therefore, medical care obligations are now $13.6 trillion lower than the data on which Wolfe based his claim, largely due to the Health Care Reform Act adopted last year. Social security obligations amount to an additional $1.5 trillion. The net effect of these changes is that projections of future commitments are $12 trillion lower than the 2009 data used by the wolf. However, the reports of the trustees for this year were not issued when Wolfe filed his claim, so we must consider the 2010 reports. Last year &apos; s projections showed that medical care commitments amounted to $22.78 trillion over 75 years, and social security amounted to $7.95 trillion for a total of $30.73 trillion. Using this comparison, the wolf will disappear by more than $15 trillion. Of course, religion has also changed. The report indicates that the public sector &apos; s debt -- that is, United States bonds held by foreign individuals, enterprises and States -- is on the list in the amount of $7.6 trillion. On the day he issued his statement, it was $9.7 trillion. So add $2.1 trillion back and it's decreasing by about $13 trillion. Other figures have also changed, but you understand the following point: 2009 was not a safe figure in April 2011. Others argue that estimating unfunded liabilities to 75 years in the future is not safe at all. \"It is certain that one can come up with all kinds of frightening - but essentially meaningless - estimates of \"unfunded responsibility\" for federal government programs,\" as Bertellis, the economic expert in Brookings, said. \"As a general rule of thumb, the greater the appreciation, the more meaningless it is.\" Bertiles noted that the figures changed radically on the basis of annual policy decisions and that the 75-year measure was arbitrary because the obligation did not end then. \"It's impossible to predict 25 years in the future with great precision, let alone 75 years or all eternity,\" he said. So let's review it. Wolf claims that the United States is facing \"more than $62 trillion in unfunded debt.\" First, he and many others abuse the term \"unfunded liabilities\" to describe the future costs of government promises. Unlike mortgages, the United States does not reserve payment on the basis of existing conditions. In fact, Congress changes terms all the time. Second, the numbers on which Wolfe based his claim are very old. In fact, using the 75-year estimates he mentioned, the figure would be well below $62 trillion based on 2011 figures. Therefore, while Wolfe &apos; s claim was based on an actual figure, it was initially shaky because of distant expectations and the prospects for change. We're assessing his claim barely right.
