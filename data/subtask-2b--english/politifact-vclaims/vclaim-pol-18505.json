They noted all drop boxes were closed and locked at 8 p.m. on Election night.\u00a0\nPolitiFact last week debunked a headline attached to the same video, which went viral on TikTok. The headline said the clip showed evidence of election \"cheating,\" in California.\nWhen Trump shared the video today, he suggested there was wrongdoing by adding: \"You are looking at BALLOTS! Is this what our Country has come to?\"\n\nHere\u2019s PolitiFact\u2019s analysis from its recent fact check. We\u2019ll offer a rating on Trump\u2019s sharing of the video at the end.\nA TikTok video on Nov. 4, the day after Election Day, suggested there was \"cheating\" for Joe Biden in California because some ballots weren\u2019t collected until he had already been declared the winner in that state over President Donald Trump on Election Night.\nThe viral video was headlined: \"This video was just taken (11/04) by a friend in California. The cheating is unreal!!!\"\nCalifornia did collect ballots on Nov. 4. But it was standard procedure, not any sign of cheating, to collect and then process ballots from drop boxes on that day.\u00a0\nNotably, California accepts mail-in ballots up to 17 days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3.\u00a0\nThe Video\nAs shared on TikTok, the minute-long video shows two men loading hundreds of paper items from a box into satchels. The box is on a sidewalk on what appears to be a residential street. It\u2019s not apparent where or when the video was recorded.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n By Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe woman then asks the men if they are \"official election guys,\" and one of them shows her a badge clipped to his shirt. What\u2019s on the badge is not visible. There\u2019s a sign on the box they\u2019re collecting from, but what it says is not visible, either.\nOfficial Responses\nThe day after the posting, the office of the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk responded to a posting of the video on Twitter, saying:\n\"All Drop Boxes were closed and locked at 8 p.m. on Election Night and ballots were collected the following day. These are valid ballots that will be processed and counted during the post-election canvass \u2014 like all outstanding vote-by-mail ballots.\"\nA spokeswoman for the California Secretary of State told PolitiFact the video showed ballot collection in Reseda.\nThe Associated Press and other media called California for Biden just after California polls closed Nov. 3. The AP said it declared Biden the winner of California as soon as polls closed in the state \"after results from AP VoteCast and an analysis of early voting statistics confirmed expectations that the state\u2019s longstanding political trend in favor of Democratic presidential candidates will hold.\"\nAs of the morning of Nov. 6, Biden had more than 8.24 million votes in California \u2014 65.1% of the vote \u2014 to Trump\u2019s 4.17 million, according to the Secretary of State. As of Nov. 11, Biden\u2019s total had grown to 10.27 million and Trump\u2019s to 5.36 million.\u00a0\nOur Ruling\nA poster on TikTok claiming, \"The cheating is unreal,\" shared a video widely circulated on social media that appeared to show California ballots being collected the day after the election, after the state was called for Biden.\nIn fact, it\u2019s standard procedure in California to collect and process ballots from drop boxes after Election Day. A county official said the boxes were locked at 8 p.m. on election night. The video did not depict any cheating.\nPolitiFact rated that claim False last week.\u00a0\nPresident Trump shared the same debunked video this week, suggesting it was evidence of election fraud in California.\u00a0\nWe rated that claim False.\u00a0\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is not accurate.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18505"}
