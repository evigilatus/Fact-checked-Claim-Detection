At a press conference following the White House release of Obama's original birth certificate -- after Trump raised for several weeks public questions about whether Obama was actually born in Hawaii -- Trump said: \"I think if I run, I'll do fine. And I think -- look, I'm already leading the polls, and I'm not running. ...CNN conducted a recent survey where Obama and I are statistically linked. If you want to, I can send it to you. Just call CNN.\" There was no need to contact CNN. The network quickly published a story entitled, \"Trap quotes CNN survey, but CNN did not do such a survey.\" The authors of CNN said that Trump might have been referring to a daily news/monster survey from February - more than two months ago. According to CNN, the National Survey conducted by Newsweek/Daly Best \"indicated that in a virtual general election match between President Barack Obama and Trump as a candidate for the Global Alliance Party, Obama beat Trump with only two percentage points, 43 to 41, which was good in the error of the survey sample.\" However, recent polls tell a different story, suggesting that the results of the New York and Daily Best games between Obama and Trump are either outdated, outdated or both. The Trelecle Politics website, which tracks most of the political polls, offers six of these direct matches, with an average margin of more than 13 points for Obama. In this context: ABC News/Washington Post (14-17 April): Obama 52, Trump 40: Maclachi/Marest (10-14 April): Obama 54, Trump 38: Rasmussen Reports (15-16 April): Obama 49, Trump 34: FOX News (3-5): Obama 52, Trump 34: Newswick/Dale Best (Feb 12-15), Obama 43, Trump 41: Policy Poling (Feb 11-14), Obama 48, Trump 34A: Rasmussen and Public Poling use automated means of communication, which many polling experts consider less reliable than human operators' opinion polls. In addition, Rasmussen is widely regarded as a Republican candidate while the PPP is a democratic company. The other four companies that asked the question were independent ballot boxes sponsored by media organizations and using the traditional voting methodology. In addition, the first two ballots - including the brutal New Zealand/Dayley survey - were held before Trump became closely associated with the issue of birth certificate. On February 10, 2011, Trump used for the first time a prominent place to publicly question Obama's background, when he told those attending the Congress that \"people who went to school with Obama never saw him, they didn't know who he was.\" (Four days later, Polyte Fruit gave the statement pants on the classification of the fire). After Trump began broadcasting his views on Obama's birth certificate in a series of national television interviews, his head-to-head numbers against Obama worsened. In the four elections held in April, Obama &apos; s average lead was more than 15 points. Thus, Trump not only gave the wrong reference to the opinion he showed within the margin of error, but he also ignored or did not know about more recent polls indicating that he would not work well in a face-to-face contest against Obama. We also believe that it is misleading for Trump to describe the survey as \"modern.\" In another context, he may have an argument that it is \"new,\" but in a dynamic, rapidly changing initial contest, two months is equivalent to geological ion. The fact is that the four most recent sound surveys show that Trump lost Obama in close proximity to the collapses. We appreciate Trump's demands for fire pants! On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13188"}
