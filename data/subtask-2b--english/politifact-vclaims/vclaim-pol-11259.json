According to a New York Times account, LaPierre sought to put the Martin killing in context by noting that \"violent crimes happen all the time in cities across the United States.\"\n\nSpecifically, LaPierre said, \"By the time I finish this speech, two Americans will be slain, six women will be raped, 27 of us will be robbed, and 50 more will be beaten. That\u2019s the harsh reality we face, all of us, every single day. But the media, they don\u2019t care. Everyday victims aren\u2019t celebrities. They don\u2019t draw ratings, don\u2019t draw sponsors. But sensational reporting from Florida does.\"\n\nWe won\u2019t judge LaPierre\u2019s conclusions about what the statistics mean, but we did think it would be worth checking whether the statistics are accurate.\n\nWe began by figuring out how long LaPierre\u2019s speech is. The YouTube video uploaded by the NRA runs about 33 minutes. That means that you could fit 43 such speeches into one day and 15,695 speeches into a year.\n\nTo find the actual numbers, we first turned to the FBI\u2019s uniform crime reports -- a detailed national accounting of crime statistics. Here are the overall numbers for 2010 for the closest categories to the ones LaPierre cited:\n\n\u2022 Murder and non-negligent manslaughter: 14,748\n\u2022 Forcible rape: 84,767\n\u2022 Robbery: 367,832\n\u2022 Aggravated assault: 778,901\n\nThen we calculated how many of these crimes would occur in a 33-minute period:\n\n\u2022 Killings: 0.94 killings every 33 minutes\n\u2022 Rapes: 5.4 rapes every 33 minutes\n\u2022 Robberies: 23.4 robberies every 33 minutes\n\u2022 Beatings: 49.6 beatings every 33 minutes\n\nLet\u2019s first dispense with the most straightforward statistic: aggravated assaults, or what LaPierre called \"beatings.\" LaPierre\u2019s number is very close -- only off by about 1 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, using the FBI statistics, the figure for rape is also reasonably close -- LaPierre is high by about 10 percent. LaPierre\u2019s figures for robbery are off by a larger margin -- they\u2019re about 15 percent too high.\n\nSo, LaPierre\u2019s a little high on each of these claims, but by a modest margin. The one statistic where he\u2019s far off-base concerns killings.\n\nHis use of the word \"slain\" offers some room for interpretation. The closest FBI category is \"murder and nonnegligent manslaughter.\" Using this number (14,748) LaPierre\u2019s number is more than twice the actual rate of Americans who are \"slain.\"\n\nA different data set -- the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s annual tabulation of how Americans die -- counts \"homicides\" instead and found 16,065 in 2010, or 1.02 every 33 minutes. That\u2019s a bit higher than the FBI numbers, but it still means that LaPierre\u2019s estimate of killings was roughly twice as high as they actually are.\n\nWe wondered whether LaPierre was counting suicides along with homicides. (The NRA did not return our request for further information.) But if he did, he would have been far off with that method as well. According to CDC, the combination of homicides and suicides was 53,858 in 2010, or 3.43 every 33 minutes, which would have made his estimate well short of the actual number.\n\nOur ruling\n\nOverall, LaPierre\u2019s estimate was fairly accurate. He was very close with assaults, and off by just 10 percent for rape and 16 percent for robbery. But he offered a rate of killing that was twice as high as the actual rate. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: After our story came out, the National Rifle Association got back to us. A spokesman explained that the claim \"two Americans will be slain\" during the speech had been calculated by adding the FBI figure for murder and non-negligent manslaughter (14,748) to the number killed in alcohol-impaired-driving crashes in 2010 as reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (10,228). Rounded up, that equals two deaths during the period of the speech. However, we aren\u2019t convinced by the methodology. The NHTSA data for 2010 includes 3,601 people who were passengers in the drunk driver\u2019s car, occupants of other cars on the road, or bystanders. That\u2019s only about one-third of the total fatalities. The majority of deaths in such crashes -- 6,627 -- are of the alcohol-impaired driver. We don\u2019t think deaths of alcohol-impaired drivers fit the definition of \"slain,\" unless you also include suicides more generally, which as we noted above would make LaPierre\u2019s estimate significantly lower than the actual number. On balance, we are sticking with our ruling of Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11259"}
