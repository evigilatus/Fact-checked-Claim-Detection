Read that way, Trump has a point. But even Michigan, which ranks among the top states for charter school enrollment and has active school choice programs, has no voucher program.\nSo school choice is not a yes-no deal. There\u2019s a range of policies that runs from telling parents and kids they can only go to schools in their designated area to giving them private school vouchers. In between those two poles are several options that include charter and specialized magnet schools. Biden\u2019s policy falls somewhere in the middle.\n\u2018Unity platform\u2019 addresses a DC program\nThe unity platform emerged from discussions between advisers to the Biden and Bernie Sanders campaigns seeking to bridge differences between Democratic Party factions before the general election campaign heats up. The 110-page list of recommendations never mentions the term \"school choice.\"\nIt does recommend ending one federally funded program that exists only in the District of Columbia. It\u2019s called the Opportunity Scholarship Program, and in 2019, 1,732 students in the program used taxpayer-funded vouchers to go to private schools. About 80% of the students were Black and 42% came from households that receive food stamps or welfare. The yearly cost is about $20 million.\nThe unity platform (page 83) says the program \"has consistently failed to demonstrate academic effectiveness.\"\nThe latest federal study largely backs that up. It found that after three years, \"those offered scholarships were doing no better academically, but also no worse than otherwise similar peers.\"\nThe value of the program is a matter of debate. Created in 2004 when Republicans held power, its funding tends to drop during Democratic administrations.\u00a0\nThe unity platform presses for other changes that target charter schools. It opposes for-profit and low-performing charters, and it would give local school districts a powerful say over the use of federal funds to open new charter schools or expand existing ones.\nWhat Biden says about school choice\nThe Biden campaign said he\u2019s firmly against using public money for private K-12 schools. Here\u2019s the full statement we received:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden opposes the Trump/(Betsy) DeVos conception of \u2018school choice,\u2019 which is private school vouchers that would destroy our public schools. He's also against for-profit and low-performing charter schools, and believes in holding all charter schools accountable. He does not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to public magnet schools, high-performing public charters or traditional public schools.\"\nAs part of a broader education policy outlined on his website, Biden calls for nearly tripling the Title 1 funding for aid to schools serving lower income neighborhoods and raising teacher pay.\nThe Trump-Pence 2020 website claims that Biden said \"that if he\u2019s elected, charter schools are gone.\" The campaign links to a comment Biden made at a December 2019 forum on public schools. Biden was attacking Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 policy on student sexual assault accusations. At the very end of condemning that policy on assaults, he said, \"If I\u2019m president, Betsy DeVos\u2019 whole notion from charter schools to this are gone.\"\nBiden didn\u2019t otherwise discuss charter schools or school choice broadly.\nAssessing Biden on school choice\nEdChoice, an advocacy group that aims \"to advance educational freedom and choice,\" lists a number of practices that fall under the school choice umbrella. In addition to vouchers, that list includes charter schools, specialized magnet schools (for example, for math and science or the arts) and allowing students to choose which public school they want to attend.\nBiden\u2019s platform includes all of those elements except vouchers.\n\"There are several ways to have choice,\" said Andre Perry at Brookings, a Washington policy research center. \"He doesn\u2019t want public dollars to go to private schools. That still leaves room for choice.\"\nCorey DeAngelis, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute and director of school choice at the Reason Foundation, says Trump's accusation about Biden seeking to end school choice is ambiguous.\n\"Did Trump mean all school choice, private school choice, or school choice for some families?\" DeAngelis said. \"It would have been more accurate for him to say something like \u2018Biden wants to end some forms of school choice,\u2019 or \u2018Biden wants to limit school choice.\u2019\"\nFor school reform researcher Thomas Toch, director of FutureEd at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy, Biden sits somewhere to the right of some Democratic party activists.\n\"He has not embraced the progressive wing's strong opposition to any type of school choice,\" Toch said. \"He\u2019s for choice, but not all forms of it. There are many centrist Democrats who are in the same position.\"\nOne final point about the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship voucher program that Biden opposes:\u00a0\nWashington, D.C., has a lottery program that assigns interested students to the nonprofit charter or traditional public school of their choice. Not every student gets to go where they want, but the latest report on the scholarship program suggested that \"the OSP\u2019s lack of effectiveness might be related to D.C. families\u2019 already-widespread access to school choice.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said that Biden wants to end school choice.\nBiden wants to end voucher programs that use public money to pay for private school tuition. He also opposes for-profit and low-performing charter schools.\nBut he supports good charter schools and allowing students to pick among public schools. Those also qualify as school choice options.\nTrump\u2019s sweeping accusation goes too far. We rate this Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17751"}
