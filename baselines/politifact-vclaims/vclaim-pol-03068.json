Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nCaptions on photos of the two houses say the girls won\u2019t be getting the mansions because President Donald Trump will return the mansions to the Russian government, but the fate of the properties hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet, hence Peskov\u2019s demand.\n\"Those properties to which you refer are part of a larger dialogue with the Russian Federation,\" Deputy Secretary of State John J.
