I want us to build wind farms, biomass, biodiesel and solar. That\u2019s my emphasis.\"\n\nMcAuliffe also issued a 30-page energy plan in 2009 that called for the development of clean energies and offered no hope for coal, other than an eagerness to retrain workers leaving the industry. He called for upgrades in emission controls that would make Virginia coal plants \"the cleanest in America\" and make the state \"a leader in carbon sequestration.\"\n\nThis year, McAuliffe seized his party\u2019s gubernatorial nomination without opposition and Republicans are claiming he\u2019s taken a much warmer position toward the fading coal industry, a long-time staple of the economy in Southwest Virginia.\n\nProof of change, the GOP says, can be found in a May 8 article in the Bristol Herald Courier which quotes McAuliffe -- after visiting the headquarters of Alpha Natural Resources, one of the nation\u2019s largest producers of thermal and metallurgical coal -- as saying he wants to help the coal industry grow. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was over at Alpha Natural Resources talking about what they need done to make sure we have a healthy work force of coal, that coal can continue,\" McAuliffe told reporters. \"We need to make sure we do what we need to, to make sure this vital industry here in Virginia continues to grow. I can really help them on exports; to open up those Asia markets in China and Korea. As governor, I want to help them create more jobs to help exports around the world.\"\n\nJosh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, did not reply to three requests to explain whether his boss\u2019s coal policy had changed.\n\nSchwerin, however, did provide some information to The Virginian-Pilot in a May 23 article. \"Terry believes we need to support coal workers, both through increased exports throughout the world, and workforce training to ensure that displaced workers can find new careers,\" he said. \"The fact is, we need an all of the above energy policy that focuses on increasing renewable energy like wind and solar while supporting existing Virginia industries.\"\n\nComparing all the statements, it\u2019s clear McAuliffe is friendlier to coal now then he was four years ago, when he urged Virginia to \"move past coal.\" This year, unlike 2009, he is promising to help the industry \"grow,\" promising to promote coal exports to Asian markets and calling for an \"all of the above energy policy.\"\n\nMcAuliffe does not mention coal in a 13-page agenda entitled \"Keeping Virginia Competitive in a Global Economy,\" or on campaign website site posts about his agendas on energy and jobs. In each of the postings, he talks up the need to create clean energy jobs -- particularly wind power.\n\nBut McAuliffe\u2019s words in Bristol ring loudly.
