Driver Kin Yiu Cheung faces charges of involuntary manslaughter. Virginia State Police say driver fatigue contributed to the crash.\n\nPeter Pantuso, president and CEO of the American Bus Association, a lobbying group, said the tragedy should not overshadow an excellent safety record by the U.S. bus industry.\n\nBuses travel the country \"with a stellar safety record, a safety record that exceeds that of any other commercial mode or surface transportation mode,\" he said at a June 7 press conference in Richmond.\n\nPantuso made two claims about safety: 1) That buses are safer than any other commercial \u00a0mode, and; 2) \u00a0That buses are the safest surface transportation mode. We checked out both.\n\nThe Department of Transportation keeps safety statistics, but you have to go to a lot of offices to collect them. Different data -- often hard to compare -- is kept by the various agencies that oversee planes, trains and automobiles.\n\nWe started by looking at highway safety. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 33,808 people were killed in automobile accidents during 2009, the latest year statistics are available. Of those people, 26 were bus passengers -- less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the total fatalities.\n\nIn 2008, according to the NHTSA, 37,423 people died in U.S. vehicle accidents. That year, 67 of those killed, or about two-tenths of one percent, were bus passengers. Data going back to 2005 show bus passengers accounted for a similar percentage of vehicle deaths in other years. \u00a0\n\nAirlines are safer than buses. In 2010, there were no fatalities in commercial U.S. airline travel. During the past decade, there has not been a single year when more than 100 people were killed in airline crashes, with the exception of 2001. That year airline deaths were high because of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThough fatalities are very low among airlines, there are several hundred air-travel deaths each year, primarily when private or chartered planes crash. \u00a0\n\nAll of these raw statistics, though, don\u2019t give us a good \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the safety of different transportation modes. So we turned to the National Safety Council, which focuses on improving workplace and transportation safety. \u00a0\n\nEach year, the NSC produces a book of injury facts. The book\u2019s transportation section determines how many deaths occur per passenger mile. Here\u2019s how the statistic is calculated: If four friends leave Richmond and drive 100 miles to Norfolk, that\u2019s 400 passenger miles. The return trip is another 400 passenger miles. The same principle applies to air or train travel.\n\nThe NSC, using Department of Transportation data on fatalities and miles traveled, computes fatality rates for travel by plane, bus, train and automobile, The agency\u2019s 2011 report contains average fatality rates for 2006 through 2008. Each rate is per 100 million passenger miles:\n\n* Scheduled airlines: 0.003\n\n* Commercial buses: 0.05\n\n* Passenger trains: 0.06\n\n* Automobiles, including taxis: 0.61\n\nSimilar results emerge if you look at a 10-year average, from 1998 through 2007. Airlines have the lowest fatality rate, at 0.01 deaths per 100 million passenger miles. Buses and trains both have a rate of 0.04 deaths, and automobiles have a rate of 0.75 deaths.\n\nStatistics show that private auto fatalities have declined over the past 15 years, even as the number of drivers and amount of miles traveled has increased. The number of bus deaths has remained roughly constant, though far below the fatality rate for private auto travel.\n\nLet\u2019s review our findings.\n\nPantuso, the industry lobbyist, said buses have \"a safety record that exceeds that of any other commercial mode or surface transportation mode.\"\n\nAccording to a wealth of transportation data, buses have been the safest mode of surface transportation in recent years, narrowly edging trains when fatalities are measured per 100 million miles. Passengers are far less likely to die in a bus crash than a car crash. So buses have a strong claim as the safest mode of surface transportation.\n\nBut when it comes to moving passengers safely, nothing tops commercial air travel. The death rate of airlines is much lower than that of commercial buses.\n\nPantuso was right about buses being the safest form of surface transportation, but wrong about them being the safest form of all commercial transportation. We\u2019ll split the difference and rate his claim Half True.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12946"}
