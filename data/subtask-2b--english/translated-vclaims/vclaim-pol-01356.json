On January 12, 2021 Gruning, who died in March, was a confederate in Hitler's special forces, and became known as Auschwitz' accountant, according to New York Times' obsession with another German who faced Holocaust-related war crimes charges. He was accused of being a partner in the murder of some 300,000 Hungarian Jews, and although he asserted that he was only playing an office role in the management of Jewish confiscated funds in the death camp, he admitted that he had witnessed atrocities, including the shooting of Jews who had tried to escape by gas.
