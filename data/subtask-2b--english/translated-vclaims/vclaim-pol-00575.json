In fact, we reviewed the Governor's statement, examining his assertions: \"All the time he said that he was not in the picture; and the report \"I confirm\" that he was not in the picture. The state of Northham was shaken in February 1, when a conservative blog published a picture of the Northam page of the yearbook of a person in the black face standing next to a person in a dress and a mask of Ko Klux Klan. He made two apologies that night. More recently today, a web site published a picture of me from my 1984 annual medical school book in a clearly racist and degrading costume, and said on his wallet website. \"I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this picture and for the harm caused by that decision at that time and now,\" Northam quoted, \"that picture, and the racist and degrading attitudes that it represents do not reflect that person today or the way I acted as a soldier, a doctor and a public servant. I'm so sorry. I can't change the decisions I've made or undo the damage I've caused to my behavior at that time and today. But I take responsibility for my past actions and am willing to do the hard work of restoring your trust.\" The following day, during a national television news conference, Northam withdrew. \"When I confronted with the pictures yesterday, I was terrified that they appeared on my page,\" he said. But I believe then and now that I'm not any of the people in that picture... Northam said that he had never seen the picture before, had not been aware of its conditions, and had not known how it had reached his page or the identity of people wearing offensive uniforms. Northham confessed to wearing a black face on a different occasion that year to look like Michael Jackson in a dance contest. \"You remember these things,\" he said. Northam's changing story added fuel to calls for his resignation from his democratic colleagues. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. On 20 January 2021, \"in the light of his public recognition and apology for his decision to appear in the picture, he irrevocably lost the faith and trust of the people elected to serve,\" said the Black Caucus in the General Assembly. \"The change of his public story today casts further doubt on his ability to restore that trust.\" Since the news conference, Northam denied being a photograph. From the outset, he told his advisers that he was not in the picture - a novel supported by Clark Mercer, his Chief of Staff. Northam told the investigators that his original statement - that he was in the picture - was written by his staff and released with his consent under increasing media pressure to respond. What the report said was Northam graduated from the School of Medicine in Eastern Virginia in Norfolk. On February 2, EVMS hired McGuire Woods, a large law firm, Richmond, to investigate the racist image. A 54-page report from the company was issued on 21 May. Contrary to Northam's assertion, the report did not confirm that it was \"not in the picture.\" \"With regard to the picture on Goff. Northham's personal page, we could not conclusively identify any of the individuals photographed in the photograph,\" said the report. \"The Governor himself made inconsistent public statements in this regard.\" Northham said the photo appeared on his page because of an unknown error. The report said, \"while we didn't recognize any information that the picture was placed on the hollow. Northam's personal page in error or by any other means not in its direction, we could not determine the origin of the image conclusively.\" We asked Northham's office to show us the part of the report that the Governor says, \"Am sure\" that it's not in the picture. The press secretary, Elena Yarmowski, stated that the investigators had spoken to several former Northam classmates. She referred to a page in the report that said, \"No one met us and told us that the governor was in the picture, and no one can positively mention who was in the picture.\" That \"is consistent with the Governor's own assertion that he is not in the picture,\" Yarumowski wrote in the e-mail. Northam said about the investigation into how a racist image appeared on his page in his 1984 annual book on medical school. But Northam didn't say \"all the time\" that he wasn't in the picture. On the contrary, he originally made two apologies, saying that he was him, and then he reversed it the next day. The investigation, which lasted almost four months, was not \"confirmed\" by Northam in the personal photograph of two individuals. We couldn't identify either of the photographers. \"The Governor himself made inconsistent public statements in this regard.\" The report provides little cover for Northham. We're assessing his statement wrong.
