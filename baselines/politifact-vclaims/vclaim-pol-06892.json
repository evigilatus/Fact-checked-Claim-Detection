Jim Moran Jr. is returning to his athletic roots.\nMoran, D-8th, is the son and namesake of Jim Moran Sr., who played professional football with the Boston Redskins in the mid 1930s. The congressman, himself, played football at the College of the Holy Cross in the mid 1960s.\nMoran, who retires Jan. 3, introduced legislation this fall that would create a commission to look into the policies of the NCAA after myriad college sports scandals. The resolution calls for the panel to make recommendations to improve \"the interaction of athletics and academics\" on campuses. That includes examining the graduation rates of student athletes, rules restricting athletes\u2019 abilities to earn money, and the wherewithal of universities to finance broad athletic programs.\n\"We have a system now where in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university\u2019s head football or basketball coach, and yet only 20 schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision have athletic departments with revenue exceeding expenses,\" Moran said in a Facebook post.\nWe rated Moran\u2019s statement about coaches\u2019 pay as Mostly True. Now, we\u2019ll look at his claim that only 20 athletic departments at \u00a0the nation\u2019s largest universities are making a profit.\nLet\u2019s start with a definition of the Football Bowl Subdivision -- the term Moran used to qualify his statement.\nThere are 1,083 colleges and universities competing in sports that fall under the NCAA\u2019s governance. They are grouped into three divisions, that are defined by athletic scholarship rules and the amount of money the schools spend on sports. For example, Division I schools -- which are typically large -- can offer many full athletic scholarships, Division II schools can offer partial athletic scholarships and Division III schools are not allowed to offer sports \u00a0scholarships.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 346 Division I schools. Of them, 123 are classified as members of the Football Bowl Subdivision, the top tier of sports competition. These are colleges and universities that are eligible to compete in bowl games and have average attendance of at least 15,000 at their home games. So Moran is generally talking about the athletic department finances at large universities that field football teams.\nMoran\u2019s spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, said the congressman\u2019s claim was based on an NCAA study on Division I athletic department budgets that was released in April. The report says, \"A total of 20 athletics programs in the FBS reported positive net revenues for the 2013 fiscal year.\" The study deals in broad statistics and does not identify schools that are in the black or the red.\nOnly two sports were profitable at FBS schools, according to the report. Football programs netted a median profit of slightly more than $3 million and men\u2019s basketball netted a median $340,000. But the profits at most schools quickly vanished after paying for a long list of other intercollegiate teams, all of which lose money. The median loss among of athletic departments was $11.6 million.\nHere are some other findings from the NCAA report:\n\nMedian revenues generated by athletic departments increased by 3.2 percent from 2012 to 2013, while expenses went up 10.6 percent;\nOf the 20 schools that made money, the median profit \u00a0was $8.4 million;\nOf the 103 schools that lost money, the median deficit was $14.9 million;\nThe highest total revenues generated by an athletic department was $169.7 million;\nThe highest total expenses by an athletic department was $146.8 million.\n\nAccording to the report, all athletic departments outside of the FBS operate in the red. In other words, only 20 of the 1,083 college sports programs in the nation are profitable.\nOur ruling\nMoran said only 20 FBS schools generate more money from athletics than they spend. We rate his statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06892"}
