In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Lithonia Democrat, unleashed a statistic that could give even a staunch Title X critic pause. \u00a0\n\n\"Studies have shown that in the absence of Title X, we are going to see the level of abortion in Georgia increase by about 44 percent,\" Johnson said.\n\nReally?\n\nTitle X serves at least 144,000 Georgians, of whom 139,000 are women. Federal rules bar those funds from being used for abortion. But anti-abortion advocates believe that revoking them would hurt groups such as Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions at some of its clinics.\n\nThe House also voted to bar all federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nJohnson spokesman Andy Phelan sent us statistics from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy group, to back up the congressman\u2019s claim. \u00a0\n\nGuttmacher\u2019s roots lie in the movement to support abortion rights, but advocates on both sides of the abortion debate use its research to back their positions.\n\nJohnson\u2019s paraphrase of Guttmacher\u2019s research was right on. The institute\u2019s Title X fact sheet for Georgia says, \"In the absence of these services, the level of abortion in Georgia would be 44 percent higher.\" \u00a0\n\nMethods to determine whether publicly funded family planning services reduce the number of unintended pregnancies have existed for \"decades,\" said Guttmacher\u2019s Jennifer Frost, a senior researcher and lead author of a 2008 paper about the group\u2019s predictions.\n\nIn the absence of affordable care, women tend to choose birth control methods that are less effective, Frost said.\n\nSince researchers cannot conduct actual experiments on what would happen if these services ended, Frost and her colleagues considered five types of behaviors -- ranging from switching contraceptive methods to dropping contraception all together -- that women might choose if funding disappeared.\n\nThe research team knew from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data how often women who adopt these behaviors had unplanned pregnancies and abortions. It used this information for its projections.\n\nNationally, abortions would rise by about one-third, the team predicted. Because Georgia women use Title X services at greater than the national rate, Guttmacher predicted a 44 percent increase here.\n\nIn 2008, 39,820 women obtained abortions in Georgia, according to Guttmacher.\n\nWe were unable to find another study on Georgia similar to Guttmacher\u2019s, but its research does align with studies on the broader topic of how contraceptive use affects abortion rates. When contraception increases, the abortion rate generally declines, said Charles Westoff, a Princeton University professor who has compared data for dozens of countries. \u00a0\n\n\"It is obvious to most people that if the prevalence or availability of modern contraceptives is reduced, the unintentional pregnancy rate will rise and thus the abortion rate,\" Westoff said.\n\nGuttmacher may have underestimated the unintended pregnancies Title X averts, said Diana Greene Foster, a reproductive health expert at the University of California, San Francisco. She studied the group\u2019s California numbers and thinks they are 20 percent too low.\n\n\"I can\u2019t say that their estimate of pregnancies averted for Georgia is too low by 20 percent. But I believe that in general, their methodology produces conservative estimates,\" Foster told PoltiFact Georgia in an e-mail.\n\nUniversity of Alabama professor Michael New, whose research is widely used to support anti-abortion positions, says Guttmacher\u2019s figures are unpersuasive.\n\nNew cited a 2002 Guttmacher study on women who had abortions. Of those who did not use contraceptives, 12 percent said they could not afford or gain access to them. This low percentage suggests Title X has little effect on abortions, New said. \u00a0\n\nThat same study, however, also found that women with lower income and education levels are less likely to use contraception, and those who use no contraception are more likely to have abortions.\n\nNew also cited a Guttmacher analysis of abortion statistics in 13 countries. Abortions declined in seven of those countries after modern contraception became popular, but they initially rose in the U.S. and five other countries. Still, in the U.S. and at least three other countries where abortions increased, abortion rates eventually declined.\n\nDid Johnson get his facts right?\n\nJohnson said \"studies\" show Georgia\u2019s abortion level would increase by 44 percent. In fact, he cited a single study from a widely respected group. While scholars have found that in general, increases in the use of contraceptives lead to decreases in abortion, and one expert said Guttmacher may have underestimated its Georgia figures, we found no other study that confirms or refutes its conclusions about this state.\n\nJohnson would have been right if he said that studies show contraception decreases abortion, and that without Title X funds, abortions could rise. \u00a0\n\nBut he didn\u2019t. We therefore rate his statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelanie Crozier\n\n\nstated on July 21, 2010 in a Politico article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Handel \"would have felt like it was OK to go in and abort\" Sarah Palin's son Trig, who has Down syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 July 26, 2010", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13386"}
