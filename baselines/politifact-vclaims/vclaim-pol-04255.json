The issue faded after Obama released a long-form version of his birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii, but it wasn\u2019t until a couple of weeks ago that Trump publicly put the matter to rest.\nWhen debate moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what took him so long, Trump tried to divert blame for the birther movement to two Clinton insiders, Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign manager, and Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and occasional staffer.\n\"If you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened,\" Trump said. \"Blumenthal sent McClatchy -- a highly respected reporter at McClatchy -- to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard.\"\nWere Solis Doyle and Blumenthal -- two top Clinton aides in 2008 -- pressing the birther movement very hard?\nWe\u2019ll take each person in turn.\nWhat Doyle said on CNN\nDoyle was on CNN on Sept. 16, 2016, and she was talking about an episode in 2007 during the Democratic primary. Doyle described a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who forwarded an email that promoted \"the conspiracy.\" Asked during the interview if she meant the birther rumor, Doyle said she did.\nThe Trump campaign pointed to this as an admission that at least someone in the campaign played a role. But Doyle later clarified she was referring to a volunteer who was fired for forwarding an email about Obama\u2019s religion, not birthplace. Regardless of what Doyle said in her interview, that is what happened. (PolitiFact wrote about it here.)\nA rumor about Obama\u2019s religion has an important difference from a rumor about his birthplace. While the two falsehoods overlap, only one -- whether he was born in the United States, would affect his ability to hold office under the Constitution.\nBlumenthal and McClatchy\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlumenthal became a central figure in the birther controversy just recently. James Asher, the former Washington bureau chief of the McClatchy News service, tweeted on Sept. 15, 2016, that Blumenthal suggested in 2008 he look into rumors that Obama was born in Kenya.\nHowever, Blumenthal has told many news organizations that the editor\u2019s claim is false, and that he never raised the issue of Obama\u2019s birthplace.\nWhen a McClatchy reporter tried to reconstruct what actually happened, he confirmed that Blumenthal contacted Asher, and that a McClatchy reporter in Kenya explored whether Obama was born there, along with running down several other rumors. But McClatchy found no proof that Blumenthal questioned Obama\u2019s birthplace.\nThe article quoted an email Blumenthal sent to Asher in 2008. While Blumenthal discusses Obama\u2019s family connections to Kenya, there\u2019s no mention of where Obama was born.\n\"On Kenya, your person in the field might look into the impact there of Obama\u2019s public comments about his father. I\u2019m told by State Dept officials that Obama publicly derided his father on his visit there and that was regarded as embarrassing,\" Blumenthal wrote.\nAsher gave a new statement to McClatchy that steps back a bit from the certainty he expressed in his original tweet.\n\"Blumenthal visited the Washington Bureau of McClatchy, where he and I met in my office,\" Asher said. \"During that conversation and in subsequent communications, we discussed a number of matters related to Obama. He encouraged McClatchy to do stories related to Obama and his connections to Kenya.\"\nAsher said he remembered Blumenthal mentioning Obama\u2019s birthplace but acknowledged that he had nothing in writing.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that Clinton insiders pushed the rumor that Obama was not born in America. His first example, Doyle, actually was involved in firing a county level volunteer coordinator who spread the rumor that Obama was a Muslim. The president\u2019s religion might overlap thematically, but it is distinct from rumors about his birthplace.\nTrump\u2019s focus on Blumenthal lacks solid evidence. Blumenthal denies the allegation and the man who made it says he has no written proof.\nWe rate this claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92a47423-d419-497c-800a-ea34cf90ecf1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04255"}
