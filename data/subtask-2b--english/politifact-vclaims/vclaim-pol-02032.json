That raises the possibility of taxpayers having to pay for the police actions and made us wonder about an alderman\u2019s statement made in connection with the incident:\nHas the City of Milwaukee paid, since 2015, more than $22 million to settle police misconduct lawsuits?\nStatement by an alderman\nThe incident with Brown never sat well with Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan, who represents the south side neighborhood where it occurred -- but not necessarily because of how Brown was treated.\nDays after the incident, Donovan accused Mayor Tom Barrett, a frequent political rival, of having \"ordered\" that Brown not be charged with a crime -- allegations Barrett strongly denied.\n(Brown had been arrested on a tentative misdemeanor charge of resisting or obstructing an officer. But ultimately police decided not to request criminal charges be filed.)\nNow back to the release of the videotape.\nIt had been reported two days before the release of the video when it would be released. Several hours before the release, Donovan issued a news release that didn\u2019t mention Brown, but seemed to allude to him. The release carried this headline: \"Has policing in urban America become an undoable job?\"\nDonovan, who is known as strongly pro-police, lamented a lack of respect for officers, saying: \"And there\u2019s another thing that I just don\u2019t get: Why someone would refuse to obey a lawful order given by a police officer.\"\nJust before using the Taser, which emits an electrical shock, on Brown, officers had told him to remove his hands from his pockets. Brown, who had taken his hands in and out of his pockets several times before that, replied: \"Hold on. I've got stuff in my hands.\"\nThe Donovan statement from the news release that we want to check is this:\n\"Since 2015, the City of Milwaukee has spent more than $22 million on settlements with litigants accusing police of misconduct.\"\nThe figures\nIn October 2017, seven months before Donovan made his claim, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported:\nPolice misconduct has cost Milwaukee taxpayers at least $17.5 million in legal settlements since 2015, forcing the city to borrow money to make the payouts amid an ever-tightening budget.\n\nThat amount jumps to at least $21.4 million when interest paid on the borrowing and fees paid to outside attorneys are factored in, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis found.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, the city was considering whether to close six fire stations, leading Ald. Bob Bauman to say: \"Just have the police stop violating civil rights, and we\u2019d have plenty of money for fire houses.\"\nSo, the $21.4 million is close to Donovan\u2019s claim of more than $22 million.\nOfficial tally: $20.2 million\nWhen we asked Donovan the source for his statement, he provided us a May 3, 2018, memo from the city\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau.\nThe memo says that since 2015, the city has paid $20.2 million to settle police misconduct lawsuits or claims against the city, including four that exceeded $2 million:\n\n\n\n\nCase\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChaunte Ott, wrongfully convicted of 1995 homicide\n\n\n$6.5 million\n\n\n\n\n74 African-Americans subject to strip, body cavity searches\n\n\n$5 million\n\n\n\n\nWoman raped by officer after he responded to her 911 call\n\n\n$2.5 million\n\n\n\n\nDontre Hamilton shot to death by officer in a park\n\n\n$2.3 million\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBut more pending\nThe memo goes on to say that the total is $22.1 million if a pending settlement of $1.9 million in a stop-and-frisk lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union is included.\nOn May 8, 2018, a Common Council committee postponed a vote to recommend approving the settlement when aldermen were told the estimated settlement could be much higher -- some $6 million.\nSo, that settlement has not been finalized.\nOur rating\nDonovan says: \"Since 2015, the City of Milwaukee has spent more than $22 million on settlements with litigants accusing police of misconduct.\"\nThe city\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau puts the tally at $20.2 million, but notes that a pending settlement in one case would push the total to $22.1 million.\nWe rate Donovan\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2018-05-24 17:37:37 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True   \"Since 2015, the City of Milwaukee has spent more than $22 million on settlements with litigants accusing police of misconduct.\"     Bob Donovan Milwaukee alderman https://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/ccCouncil/News/2018/District08/08-HaspolicinganurbanAmericabecomeanundoablejob2.pdf   In a news release Wednesday, May 23, 2018 2018-05-23    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02032"}
