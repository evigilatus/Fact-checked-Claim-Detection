In the second year, the quarterback Patrick Mahomes exploded on the landscape of the national armed forces with 5,097 yards, 50 Tosh Down season making him the youngest national football player since Dan Marino in 1984. The combination of Mahom and Major Coach Andy Reed led to one of the most explosive crimes in the national armed forces, a crime that led the Group to record 12-4, the Western Division of AFC and a final victory over Colts Indianapolis. While the season came to a tragic end at 37-31, the loss of overtime at home to the Super Bowl champion at the end of New England Patriots, On 22 January, two days after the loss of patriots, the state of Sin Kikki Corles, Kansas City, contested a resolution, Security Council resolution No. 4, which appointed the Presidents of Kansas City as the official football team of Missouri State before the rules of the Senate, common rules and the Committee on Decisions and Ethics. In presenting her arguments, Curls said, \"We are one of the largest tracking teams in the country and Arrohead is the highest stadium in the world.\" Is Arrowhead's playground really the highest in the world? We wanted to know. Well, according to Gaines Global Records, Curls didn't respond to our request for comment, right. On 29 September 2014, Gennis measured noise at the Arrowhead Stadium on 41-14 patriots. The record was broken with eight seconds left in the first quarter after President Shine Verin was stuffed in New England without any gain on the second floor. To give you some context, 140 D.B.A. is the estimated sound on the surface of a busy aircraft carrier. However, Guinness's record is the highest public roar in the stadium, not the highest stadium in general. The index is essentially the highest moment recorded inside the stadium. These roars are far from authentic. The teams usually motivate fans to \"get a loud voice\" for the messages on the Gambotron, and fans are informed before the game that the team is trying to break the record. While measuring the real public noise in each match would be the best way to determine the sounds of the stadium, we could not find numbers that measured anything other than the roar of individual audiences. Facebook was published on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook article on Hank Aaron's death due to a COVID-19 vaccine. By Noah Y. Kim: 26 January 2021 we did it. #Loud & Produud #Rids Kingdom pic.twitter.com/qrNHbXc5MA - Presidents of Kansas City (@rads) September 30, 2014 \"100 percent (we can feel the crowd card), said Mahoms in January News. \"When you get out warmed before the game and feed on energy because fans there fill the field early, it's really your own. We're feeding on that whole game.\" In 1990, the Hall of the famous quarterback John Eloway asked the referee to calm the Arohead crowd. This happened again in 1992 in a game against Oakland Riders, this time with rulers who threatened to take one of the stopovers in Kansas City if the crowd did not ask for the volume again. The brief history of the unofficial name of the world's highest stadium is interesting. Until 2013, supporters of the Turkish Galatasari Football Club were recording the March 2011 calendar of 131.76 DBA. This mark was the first to be won by Seattle Seahawks fans in Centralfield on September 15, 2013, with a reading of 136.6 DBA. Subsequently, the index between the two leaders and Seahawks was challenged for the remainder of the season, with the two leaders breaking the Ceehawks index only 28 days later so that Centurylink Field could later recover the highest point before Aruhid set the current record in 2014. Some may refer to the maximum capacity of 76,416 at the Arrowhead Stadium versus the capacity of 67,000 at Centurylink Field as a reason for keeping the record. However, this does not explain the structural differences between the two stadiums. The architect who designed the CenturyLink field, Paul Greismer, said that the stadium was designed to increase public noise, referring to the ceiling, the proximity of fans, and the use of metals and concrete as key factors. \"It's a metal roof, so of course it's a very reflective surface,\" said Grizzmer in an interview with Radio Kero. \"As the seating vessel, which is largely concrete. So there's a lot of that stuff that serves as sound media, if you want, and the sound goes back. \"In the way the surface angles, and the way the vessel captures all the sound that goes back and focuses on it again towards the center of the field, you will largely get the maximum effect on the players.\" So while the record of Gennis is not a big measure of what is actually the highest stadium all over the game, the Arrowhead Stadium has the same value as any stadium in the world's highest stadium. The governor says that Aarhead is the highest court in the world. According to the Gennis World Records book, the Arrohead Field 142.2 D.B.A. on 29 September 2014, the game against patriots is the most violent roar of the crowd ever recorded at a sporting event. This record, together with other examples of extremely loud crowds in the Arrowhead Stadium, gives Arohead a legitimate claim to name the highest stadium in the world. However, since the Gaines Register is far from fully measured, Curls &apos; claim may use some additional context. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00913"}
