The hope is they will reduce deaths by suicide, accidental shootings or someone stealing a law enforcement officer\u2019s weapon. They are not sold in the United States, though two dealers tried before backing down amid intense pressure from activists.\nHayes supports the technology, but Pratt and other gun-rights advocates are skeptical. Pratt questions the guns\u2019 reliability, saying smart guns are \"only 80 percent effective.\" When Hayes pressed Pratt for the source of his statistic, Pratt cited the New Jersey Institute of Technology.\n\"Twenty percent of the time it won\u2019t work,\" Pratt said. \"And you\u2019re asking people to put their lives in the hands of a product like that?\"\nLater, Pratt used the figure again. \"Is it okay to put on the market a car that 20 percent of the time explodes on you and causes you harm or death?\"\nSince Pratt tripled down on his statistic, PunditFact wanted to check it out.\nTracing the source of the claim\nPratt pointed to a 2003 column in Popular Mechanics magazine headlined \"\u2018Smart\u2019 Guns: Dumb Idea!\"\nThe column was inspired by a 2002 New Jersey law that requires all guns sold in the state to have \"smart\" technology within three years of the attorney general verifying the first smart gun was sold in the United States. Fear among gun rights activists that more government mandates may come when this happens drive their opposition to smart guns.\nIn his column 11 years ago, writer Cliff Gromer said law enforcement officers are exempt from the law, which proves the technology isn\u2019t solid enough for the mainstream gun market.\n\"According to the New Jersey Institute of Technology, which used government grants to study personalized handgun technology, fingerprint recognition systems work only 80 percent of the time,\" Gromer wrote. \"But the New Jersey law goes into effect regardless of whether the guns are 100 percent -- or 80 percent -- reliable.\"\nArticle is not the smoking gun\nYou may have read over it, but the 80 percent figure Gromer cited talks about fingerprint recognition systems. Not whether a smart gun will work.\nThat\u2019s important because while some smart guns use fingerprint recognition systems (which work like the new unlocking method for iPhones), not all do.\nThe German-made Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol was expected to be the first smart gun sold in the United States this year until a California gun store owner scrapped plans to sell it after facing aggressive backlash. It happened again with a Maryland dealer.\nThe Armatix does not have a fingerprint recognition system. Instead, the gun works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun to make it active. The signal is akin to what\u2019s emitted from those bulky tags on mall merchandise that aren\u2019t triggered until taken out of the store. Other models work with similar chips implanted in everyday accessories, such as bracelets, pins and rings, and some are implanted in the body.\nIf the badge is too far away from the microchip in the gun, it will stop working. But that means the technology works, not that it failed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, more critically, the Armatix radio signal has nothing to do with the study Pratt cited, which focused on fingerprint recognition systems, New Jersey Institute of Technology researchers told us.\nOther smart guns also avoid fingerprint technology. Michael Recce, an associate professor in the information systems department at the\u00a0New Jersey Institute of Technology, invented \"dynamic grip recognition\" and applied it to a gun, so that it fires\u00a0only after it recognizes the user\u2019s grip thanks to sensors on the side of the gun that detect pressure and the contours of the user's hand. The gun starts to detect if the user is authorized as someone starts pulling the gun, he said.\nRecce said the owner detection rate for his dynamic grip \"is within the mechanical failure rate,\"\u00a0i.e. the rate at which a standard gun fails. However, two or three people out of 100 adults could also fire the gun in trials because their hand is similar to the owner\u2019s -- a tradeoff with the technology so it is sure to fire for the rightful owner, he said.\nOther types of smart guns in varying stages of development are outlined in a year-old National Institute of Justice report commissioned as part of President Barack Obama\u2019s gun reforms after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings.\nThis research is dated\nIn this case, the New Jersey Institute of Technology research is being misapplied, and it\u2019s old. Researchers told us their work on fingerprint scanners should not be applied to newer guns.\nTheir research, which was not published, was done in the early 2000s on four types of guns using fingerprint readers. None of those guns were as reliable as mechanical firearms, they found, though the guns were a \"fragile technology\" then, said Donald Sebastian, New Jersey Institute of Technology senior vice president for research and development.\n\"Fingerprint readers may have progressed in the past 10 years,\" Recce said. \"At that time even the readers on laptops would often require you to swipe your finger more than once before they worked. Our opinion was that swiping your finger over the reader multiple times would be a challenge when using a gun.\"\nSkeptics of these guns point to many concerns about the reliability of the weapons in a high-pressure situation, like who has time to enter a PIN code, and what if the sensors in the gun die? Michael Bazinet, a National Shooting Sports Foundation spokesman, said the \"strongest statement on their reliability\" will be when law enforcement officers use them en masse.\nBut other potential weaknesses don\u2019t change the fact that what Pratt cited is old news.\n\"To make a universal blanket statement based on a 15-year-old analysis of fingerprint detectors just doesn\u2019t pass muster,\" Sebastian said. \"It\u2019s like talking about the reliability of a Model T and comparing it to a race car. Apples and oranges.\"\nIf not 80 percent reliable, then what?\nFinding a reliability rate for smart guns is an \"almost unanswerable question,\" said Stephen Teret, a pro-smart gun Johns Hopkins professor and director of the university\u2019s Center for Law and the Public\u2019s Health. \"Because there\u2019s a wide range of quality in existing guns, some are better, some are worse. So when you are trying to compute a rate of reliability, are you using one gun or various categories?\"\nRobert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control (whom Hayes brought in after Pratt to talk about the issue), said in order for the Armatix iP1 gun to be sold in California, it had to pass a reliability test.\n\"The standard was a 99 percent successful fire rate, which it met (fire 600 times with 6 or fewer failed discharges),\" Spitzer said.\nOthers stressed that all guns are prone to failure at some point. The mechanical\u00a0failure rate is often given as 1 in 1,000, and a military weapon\u2019s failure rate is closer to 1 in 10,000, Sebastian said.\n\"Misfire is embedded in our language,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nPratt said \"20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work,\" which he got from a 2003 magazine story referencing unpublished research from the New Jersey Institute of Technology.\nThe scientists who conducted that research say Pratt\u2019s citation is misapplied. Researchers only looked at smart guns that rely on fingerprint sensors, yet Pratt applied the statistic to all smart guns, including the Armatix pistol that works with a black stopwatch, PIN code and small electronic chips. Even more, their research is more than a decade old, and they say fingerprint matching technology has changed since then.\nPratt\u2019s statement is not based on solid evidence.
