Ted Cruz of Texas.\u00a0\nBiden has dismissed those requests. Speaking in Philadelphia two days after Ginsburg\u2019s death, the former vice president rejected the call again, while urging the Republican-led Senate to let the winner of the presidential election pick Ginsburg\u2019s replacement.\u00a0\nIn doing so, Biden wrongly claimed the Trump campaign asked for his list only after Ginsburg died. (He also claimed, falsely, that \"there's no court session between now and the end of this election.\")\n\"After Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, they said \u2018Biden should release his list,\u2019\" Biden said in the Sept. 20 address. \"It\u2019s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release the list only after she passed away. It\u2019s a game for them. It\u2019s a play to gin up emotions and anger.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign noted that the claim came as Biden diverged slightly from his prepared remarks, which the campaign provided to PolitiFact. His prepared line was: \"It\u2019s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release a list only hours after Justice Ginsburg passed away.\"\nBoth Trump and his campaign called several times for Biden to put out a list of prospective nominees before Ginsburg\u2019s death on Sept. 18. When the campaign unveiled the 20 additions to Trump\u2019s list in a Sept. 9 press release, it wrote, \"Biden must do the same.\"\u00a0\nHey @JoeBiden,Trump Campaign here!We asked for your prospective SCOTUS nominee list on September 9th, 2020.https://t.co/d5Xo94EGab\u2014 Team Trump (Text VOTE to 88022) (@TeamTrump) September 20, 2020 \nTrump\u2019s campaign staff cited that announcement and other examples disproving Biden\u2019s claim on Twitter and on its website, and the campaign flagged a few more in response to an inquiry:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 17, the Trump campaign released a statement saying \"it\u2019s time for Joe Biden to release a list of his own potential Supreme Court nominees.\"\n\n\nOn Sept. 12, Trump said at a campaign rally in Minden, Nev., \"I put out a list of an additional number of very conservative, highly thought of, highly respected judges ... They are the only people that I will consider for the Supreme Court of the United States. And I'm asking Joe Biden to do the same thing.\"\n\n\nOn Sept. 9, Trump said at the White House, \"Joe Biden has refused to release his list, perhaps because he knows the names are so extremely far left that they could never withstand public scrutiny or receive acceptance.\"\n\n\nOn Aug. 24, Trump said in an Aug. 24 Republican National Convention speech,\u00a0\"I'm demanding, actually, a list. Let Biden put up a list of the judges he's going to appoint.\"\n\n\nTrump made similar statements during a \u00a0June 22 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network and a June 20 campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla.\nThe Trump campaign has ramped up its calls for a Biden list since Ginsburg\u2019s death. But in Philadelphia, Biden gave three reasons why he didn\u2019t want to publish the names of his potential nominees \u2014 and why he thought Trump\u2019s decision to do so was unconventional.\nBiden argued that putting judges\u2019 names on such a list could influence their decisions in courts where they currently serve, subject them to \"unrelenting political attacks\" without an immediate hearing at which to defend themselves, and upend the traditional process of consulting with the Senate on nominees.\nTrump put out a similar list as a candidate in 2016. In June, Biden told reporters he was thinking about qualified African American women with \"the experience to be on the court.\"\nOur ruling\nBiden said, \"The Trump campaign asked that I release the list (of potential Supreme Court nominees) only after (Ginsburg) passed away.\"\nTrump and his campaign challenged Biden to release such a list on multiple occasions in advance of Ginsburg\u2019s death.\nWe rate this statement False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here\u00a0for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18984"}
