The video shows otherwise.", "text": "President Donald Trump said that he stopped \"sending her back\" cheers in a rally while talking about the U.S. Republic (Elhan Omar), but a video of the gathering argued about his version of events the following day. During the 17 July race in Greenville, N.K., Trump repeated his attacks on a few liberal and democratic members of Congress, including Omar, who represents Minnesota. The next day in the White House, a journalist asked Trump about crowd cheers. Question: \"When your supporters were cheering last night 'Send it back', why didn't you stop them? Why didn't you ask them to stop saying that?\" Trump: \"Well, no. One, I think I did. I'm starting to talk too fast. It was really loud -- I disagree with it by the way, but it was a great cheer. And I felt a little bad about it. But I'm going to say this: I did, and I started talking too fast, but it started too fast, as you probably noticed.\" After some conversation with the interviewer, Trump continued: \"I wasn't happy about it, and I didn't agree with it, but again, I didn't say it, but they said it. \"But I disagree with you.\" In the video review of the gathering, we found no evidence that he made any effort to stop it, as he said. Trump was silent for about 13 seconds when his supporters were shouting \"send her back\" at the rally. What happened at the rally we used video C-SPAN to gather Trump to mark time stamps when \"send her back\" happened. When Trump mentioned Omar's name in about 31 minutes during the rally, the crowd yelled out loud. Trump then read a series of attacks about Omar's record of data on terrorism, ISIS and Al-Qaida and 11 September. These comments have led to more crowds. He said, \"She looks down with contempt for hard-working Americans, saying, \"Ignorance is rampant in many parts of this country. She can hear her \"send her back\" in the midst of other noises. In this case, Trump starts talking again quickly -- just stop for about four seconds (though we can't say if her \"send her back\" cheers at this point). He went on to say: \"It's obvious and important, Omar has a history of launching fierce anti-Semitic trenches.\" On January 13, 2021, Jake Taber stated in his remarks on CNN that Donald Trump's second presidential accusation was \"more isolated between the two parties in American history.\" From 36:00 to 13:00, Tramp is silent, holding the platform and seems to be turning his head to wipe the crowd in front of him, while \"sending her back\" cheers out loud. Then the cheers fade on their own, and Trump continues to talk about Omar at 36:26. It doesn't change the subject. We count about 13 seconds while Trump is silent during the cheers of \"send her back.\" The Trump campaign indicated that Trump did not say himself \"send her back\" or cheers. In the media available to him the following day, he was not happy with the cheers and was not okay with it. After the song, Trump continued to speak of Omar as well as three other Democrats: the Republic of Rashida Talib of Michigan, Ayana Presley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Okasio Cortez of New York. (while the age of a naturalized citizen, the other three were born in the United States) at 48 minutes, he described them as having only negative comments about America. \"That's why I say, hey, if they don't like it, let them go, let them leave,\" \"If they don't love him, tell them to leave him.\" The Trump campaign said that Trump said \"let them leave,\" which does not mean forcing someone to leave, or the crowd cheers \"send them back.\" The campaign was a similar argument about the words of the Trump tweet. In the White House, the journalist said about Trump's cheerful crowd: \"They were echoing what you said in your first tweet, that they should come back. Trump answered: \"If I examine it, I don't think you'll find it, but I don't agree with it.\" The Trump campaign said that Trump didn't tweet that congresswomen should \"go back\" - confirming what we have. In his tweet, he said if someone hated America, \"You can leave\" and \"it's your choice.\" Our judgment when one of the reporters asked Trump why the crowds didn't say \"send her back\" to stop, said, \"I think I did. \"I'm starting to talk fast.\" When the song \"Send Her Back\" was heard among other voices, Trump quickly started talking, although it was difficult to know whether he even heard the cheers. But then he continued to criticize Omar, and the cheers of \"send her back\" cheer in the crowd loudly, with many people in harmony. At this stage, Trump remains silent for approximately 13 seconds. We don't see any physical statement or language on his part to stop the cheers. Trump gave no indication that he wanted the crowd to stop. We're assessing this statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00415"}
