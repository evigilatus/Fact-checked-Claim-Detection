Tom Garrett says Medicaid fraud unit \"in Virginia alone recovered over $200 million\" last year", "text": "State Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. says Medicaid is bloated with fraud in Virginia and across the nation.\nIn an op-ed published by three newspapers last month, Garrett cited an eye-popping amount of money recovered by Virginia\u2019s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit as an argument against expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program to up to 400,000 additional residents.\nThe fraud unit, known as MFCU, operates out of the state attorney general\u2019s office. Garrett, a Republican, worked in the unit for a few years before being elected Louisa County commonwealth\u2019s attorney in 2007.\n\"Last year, the MFCU in Virginia alone recovered over $200 million!\" Garrett wrote. \"How can expanding this be a good idea?\"\nWe took a look at Garrett\u2019s $200 million claim and came across nearly identically written statements made earlier this year by two other Republicans opposed to Medicaid expansion: Dels. Kirk Cox of Colonial Heights and Tim Hugo of Fairfax County. Each of the three lawmakers cited the $200 million recovery figure in a paragraph discussing the damage Medicaid fraud inflicts on Virginia\u2019s budget.\nPaul Allen, Garrett\u2019s legislative assistant, said the senator made a mistake -- he understated the amount of Medicaid fraud recovery in Virginia. MFCU actually recouped about $1 billion during the budget year that ended in mid-2013, according to a report by the Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \u00a0\nAllen added that \"$200 million is the average year\u2019s recovery amount.\"\nMFCU, in its latest \u00a0annual report, said it recovered $1.01 billion during the budget year that ended June 30, 2013. The report shows that between 2009 and 2013, the unit recouped an average of $223.8 million a year.\nBut the figures, to be fully understood, require a lot more explanation than Garrett, Cox or Hugo provided.\nThe $1 billion-plus recovery last year was an anomaly that accounts for more than half of the total $1.9 billion total MFCU has recouped since the unit was created in 1982. Only fractions of the recovery stemmed from fraud in Virginia and were returned to state coffers.\nAlmost all of last year\u2019s recovery came from a national case MFCU prosecuted against Abbott Laboratories for misbranding one of its drugs, Depakote, as treatments for schizophrenia and aggression in elderly dementia patients. Depakote never has been proven effective for those uses.\nAbbott, which pled guilty, was ordered to pay a total of $1.5 billion to the federal government and states.\nThe Virginia Attorney General\u2019s office explained in its 2011-2012 annual report that the state\u2019s fraud unit was approached in 2007 with allegations that Abbott had illegally marketed the drug, which was provided to people on Medicare and Medicaid.\n\"Although neither the whistleblowers nor the defendant in this case were located in Virginia, the whistleblowers came to Virginia because the MFCU has a national reputation for successfully investigating major national cases,\" the Virginia attorney general\u2019s office said in a May 7, 2012, news release announcing the settlement.\nThe release broke down the $1.5 billion settlement. Abbott paid the U.S. government a $500 million criminal fine. It also paid civil penalties of $270 million to the federal Medicaid program and $291 million to Medicare and other U.S. health programs. Another $239 million was distributed to state Medicaid programs and Abbott paid an additional $198.5 million in criminal asset forfeiture penalties. Of those asset forfeitures, Virginia received $115 million because MFCU led the investigation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unit partnered with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Western Office of Virginia on the four-year probe, which the attorney general\u2019s office says entailed 40,000 man hours of investigation and sifting through 1 million records.\nVirginia Medicaid\u2019s share of the settlement portion going to states was $4.2 million. That\u2019s the total amount of fraud Abbott inflicted on Virginia\u2019s program, according to Michael Kelly, spokesman for state Attorney General Mark Herring\u2019s office.\nOutside of the Abbott case, Virginia\u2019s MFCU recovered $11 million during last year, according to Kelly.\nNow, let\u2019s get back to Garrett. His legislative assistant said the $200 million Garrett cited is the average yearly amount of Medicaid fraud recovery in Virginia. Including the Abbott settlement, MFCU has averaged recouping about $223.8 million annually during the last five budget years. If Abbott is not included, the five-year 2009-2013 annual average drops to $23.8 million.\n\"The federal government frequently lets Virginia\u2019s MFCU take the lead on large, multi-state cases,\" Kelly emailed us. \"This is important to note because it means that not all the money that is ordered recovered thanks to a Virginia case came out of Virginia\u2019s Medicaid budget, nor is it necessarily coming back to Virginia\u2019s budget.\"\nBy far, the two next biggest years for MFCU were 2007 and 2008 when the unit recovered a total of $648.8 million. Virtually all of the sum was attributable to a national case the unit prosecuted against pharmaceutical maker Purdue Frederick Company. \u00a0The company pled guilty to misbranding OxyContin as less addictive than other pain medications when no medical research supported the claim.\nThe recoveries from the Purdue and and the Abbott cases come to more than 85 percent of the $1.9 billion MFCU has recouped in its 30-year history.\nThe unit also prosecutes allegations of malfeasance by health care providers, such as double billing, charging for services not rendered and embezzlement.\nThe Department of Medical Assistance Service, the state agency that oversees the state\u2019s Medicaid program, handles cases of fraud by Medicaid recipients. In the 2013 fiscal year, the agency identified $3.4 million in \"overpayments\" to Medicaid beneficiaries, but not all of it was due to malfeasance, according to Christina Nuckols, a spokeswoman for Virginia Health Secretary Bill Hazel.\n\"Overpayments can occur for other reasons (than fraud), and sometimes they are the result of mistakes,\" she emailed.\nOur ruling\nGarrett, in arguing against Medicaid expansion in Virginia, wrote that the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit last year \"in Virginia alone recovered over $200 million!\" Garrett\u2019s aide says the senator understated the recovery, which was actually $1 billion.\nThe figures are correct. But Garrett\u2019s claim that MFCU collected $200 million \"in Virginia alone\" easily can be read as a statement about the amount of fraud that occurred in the Old Dominion.\nHe doesn\u2019t mention that almost all the money MFCU recovered last year came from a national fraud case it prosecuted against Abbott Labs.\nThe amount of Medicaid fraud Abbott committed in Virginia was $4.2 million. Outside of the Abbott case, MFCU recovered $11 million last year.\nSo Garrett\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that create a different impression about the level of fraud in Virginia\u2019s Medicaid system. It\u2019s hard to imagine Garrett wasn\u2019t clued in on the details of MFCU\u2019s work. After all, the senator was a lawyer for the unit between 2005 and 2007.\nWe rate his claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07873"}
