Williams gave at least $140,000 in gifts and loans to Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s family, many of which were not reported on state disclosure forms filed by McDonnell.\n\nCuccinelli announced this spring that he had omitted $12,000 in gifts on disclosure forms he filed between 2009 and 2012, saying it was an oversight. Of the gifts, about $5,000 came from Williams, who gave the attorney general a trip to New York aboard his private jet, a catered Thanksgiving dinner and vacations at Williams\u2019 Smith Mountain Lake home.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid criticism from Democrats, Cuccinelli in April appointed Richmond Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Michael Herring to investigate whether Cuccinelli had violated state disclosure laws.\n\nHerring, in a nine-page report released on July 18, wrote \"our investigation finds no evidence\" that Cuccinelli violated any laws or intentionally failed to disclose the gifts.\n\nContrary to McAuliffe\u2019s statement, the report does not say Cuccinelli \"should have been prosecuted but Virginia laws are insufficient.\" The report does not mention the word \"prosecute\" and it offers no opinion on the strength or weakness of the state's disclosure laws.\n\nMcAuliffe, after the debate, was asked to pinpoint language in the report verifying his claim. He offered nothing specific. \"Well, that\u2019s my analysis of the report,\" he said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcAuliffe said the ethics report said Cuccinelli \"should have been prosecuted, but Virginia laws are insufficient.\"\n\nThere is nothing in the report that remotely supports McAuliffe\u2019s claim. To the contrary, the report concludes Cuccinelli did not violate any laws.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s hyperbolic statement is not only wrong, it defies any reasonable reading of the report.
