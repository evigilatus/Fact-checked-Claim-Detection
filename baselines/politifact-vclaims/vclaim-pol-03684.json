Otherwise, she said, inmates would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status.\nBuckingham's backup sought\nWe asked Buckingham how she determined hundreds of immigrants were subsequently released. By email, her spokesman Keith Elkins provided a statement from Buckingham lacking information about her declared \"hundreds.\" Rather, Buckingham said county residents need to know the sheriff\u2019s office \"has ignored hundreds of requests to detain inmates\" in the country illegally.\nLatest count: 45 released individuals in eight days\nAccording to the sheriff\u2019s office, we confirmed, 40 individuals were released on bail by the county the first few days after the sheriff\u2019s policy took effect. When we followed up, a sheriff\u2019s office spokeswoman, Kristen Dark, emailed us additional information indicating that through the day Buckingham made her claim, 45 individuals for whom detainer requests were denied by the office had been released--leaving others (more than 150 inmates by our calculation)\u00a0still in custody, Dark said, for not making bond or because their charges had not yet been disposed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of this detail was public before Buckingham spoke.\nCiting information attributed to Dark, the Austin American-Statesman reported Feb. 2, 2017, that the new policy had \"paved the way for the release of 37 suspected unauthorized immigrants\" the day before. On the policy\u2019s first day, the newspaper reported, the sheriff\u2019s office declined requests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to place holds on 196 suspected undocumented immigrants--while the office honored 30 detainer requests.\n\"Once the so-called ICE detainers were removed, 37 people were able to bail out Wednesday,\" the newspaper reported. \"Had the detainers remained in place, inmates would still have been able to post bail, but they would have been released into ICE custody for possible deportation.\"\nA subsequent American-Statesman news story, posted online Feb. 6, 2017, said the county had denied 203 detainer requests and released 40 such individuals since the policy took effect.\nMeantime, the story said, immigration agents adjusting to the county\u2019s policy had hustled to obtain arrest warrants for 42 booked individuals who also were suspected of living in the country without legal authorization. By the time the warrants were served, the story said, eight of the inmates had posted bail and been released, requiring agents to find and arrest the suspects again. Hernandez told the paper the others named in the warrants would be released to federal agents.\nThe story quoted Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, saying federal officials had stepped-up reviews of newly arrested Travis County residents so warrants could be sought for suspects -- avoiding reliance on the sheriff\u2019s office to comply with detainer requests. The story further said immigration agents became aware that the suspects had been booked into jail by mining a federal law enforcement fingerprint database that\u2019s routinely updated by county jail staff.\nOur ruling\nBuckingham said hundreds of illegal immigrants were released in the week after the sheriff\u2019s policy was adopted.\nAccording to Travis County, 45 such individuals--not hundreds--were released in the eight days after the policy took effect.\nAdditional releases seem likely due to the sheriff\u2019s office not automatically honoring all detainer requests. But it also seems possible that stepped-up federal efforts to obtain warrants for jailed individuals will reduce the release rate.\nWe rate Buckingham\u2019s claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.
