However, as he is widely known as a political addict, the programme has also spent considerable time discussing the 2014 Senate races. :: During the weekend, the White House announced that Obama would not take executive action on immigration reform before mid-term. Obama told Todd that it was not about the upcoming elections, but the reporters did not agree. \"Democracy plays defense this year in the Senate race. They play in the red states where this issue is always hot,\" said Amy Walter of Cook's political report, one of the presenters. Taking executive action on anything the Republicans might call amnesty would strengthen the republican norm. On the contrary, if you look at the demographic composition, migration may not play an important role in promoting democratic participation in Senate races, as Todd has pointed out. \"Look at this map, you have this great situation,\" said Todd. \"Eight out of nine states with competing Senate races are of Spanish origin less than 10 per cent of the electorate.\" We thought Todd's statement was interesting, so we decided to dive deeper into numbers. ==History==Competing seats from the Senate until the election this year, Cook's political report ranks nine races as throwouts, which means that either party has a chance to win. The Cook report also calculates three other races as competitive but tending towards one party. There is some deviation in the number of competitive races. On the high end, CNN considers 12 competitive races, split into six seats \"until the takeover\" and six with Tiltz towards the party. At the lower end, VifthThine, which does not classify races as competition or otherwise, lists five seats where leaders have less than 60% chance of winning. Cook's political report is 35th CNN Alaska. Iowa, the crooked republic of Arkansas, capture Kansas, capture the facts, Greg Kelly. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021, the Republican Secure Kentucky rejects the Republican Party's riding Louisiana's ride of a Democratic Republic of Michigan, which is riding a democracy that's bending over a democracy that's bending over to North Carolina's democracy that's sprouting North Carolina's North Carolina democracy, causing West Virginia to bow down a democracy that's bending over the Republic's cheeks, with the prospect of a succession of miles, Spanish voters included a Todd scheme on the numbers of Spanish-born voters as an article in The New York Times, reading the figures from previous surveys conducted by the Census Bureau to the 2014 project elections. In order to measure well, we will compare the estimates of The Times of the Nine States with the results of the 2012 census for 12 states considered competitive. The actual turnout of Spanish voters in 2012 and the projected number of Spanish voters in 2014 is lower than the share of eligible voters. From both sources, Todd is right to say that voters of Spanish origin make up less than 10% of all voters in the states that are tossed. Whether it is one of the top five States, nine States or twelve States, only one, Colorado, has more than 10 per cent of Spanish-born voters. Mendi Romero, Project Manager for Civic Participation between the University of California and Davis, agrees with the conclusion of The Times that Spanish voters will have little influence on the 2014 competitive Senate races. But that's not without warnings. Romero said, \"Latinus still affects the races of Congress, although they may not change the results in these races.\" In the short term, Latin voters may not significantly change the shot races, but Romero said they will certainly be important in the long run. Take a look at California, once red and then purple, which is now completely blue, thanks in part to Latin voters. \"Senator of California Boxer and Vinstein are very safe, and Latinos are a big part of the story of why these seats are safe, as Romero said. The Governor (Todd) said: \"Eight out of nine states with competitive Senate races, people of Spanish origin make up less than 10 per cent of the electorate.\" Although there is some deviation in the number of competing states, it appears that nine bets are very safe, and the number reported is a good part of the news sources. As for the voting share of the inhabitants of Spanish origin, she would like the right to receive money. We value his claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07344"}
