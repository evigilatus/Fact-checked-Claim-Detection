Democrats said DeVos made it harder for certain students to get debt relief, while Republicans defended her response to Obama-era rules.\nAt the hearing, the main topic was how DeVos sought to make changes to the borrower defense to repayment rule. The provision was little used until the Obama administration established new rules to help students get their federal education loans cancelled if colleges misrepresented graduation rates, their ability to transfer credits or their job placement rates.\nThe Obama administration finalized changes to the regulations in 2016 after Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit chain, closed its doors amid fraud allegations. DeVos sought to rewrite the rules, leading to extensive litigation, including a contempt of court finding against DeVos. DeVos blamed the Obama administration for the backlog of tens of thousands of cases and announced changes that include tiers of loan relief.\u00a0\nU.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a former school board member and principal from South Florida, went after DeVos, saying she is trying to \"destroy public education.\"\u00a0\n\"You are the most unpopular person in our government,\" said Wilson, a Democrat. \"Millions will register to vote in 2020. Many will vote to remove you more than to remove the president.\"\nThe ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said Wilson\u2019s comments were \"over the line.\"\nDeVos\u2019s confirmation in 2017 was a contentious one for the Trump administration and required a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. DeVos, a longtime wealthy Republican donor from Michigan, is an advocate for vouchers and charter schools.\u00a0\nAs fact-checkers, we wanted to focus on the checkable aspect of what Wilson said: Is DeVos really the most unpopular person in the U.S. government?\nWilson\u2019s statement about \"in our government\" was overly broad, but what she was referring to was what poll respondents said about DeVos compared to other Trump Cabinet officials. We found polling that supports Wilson\u2019s statement about DeVos\u2019s popularity, but the polling is more than one year old.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling about Trump Cabinet members\nWe found that YouGov and Morning Consult have conducted separate polls that compare the favorability of Trump\u2019s Cabinet members. Wilson\u2019s spokeswoman cited a 2017 article in the Huffington Post entitled, \"How Betsy DeVos Became The Most Hated Cabinet Secretary.\"\nThe article cited an October 2017 HuffPost/YouGov internet poll that found 35% had a strongly unfavorable view of DeVos, the highest among 13 officials. (Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions finished second.)\u00a0\nHowever, the poll also showed that many respondents were not familiar enough with the Cabinet members to give a favorability opinion. DeVos was among the most familiar officials, as 30% of respondents said they were unfamiliar with her.\u00a0\nYouGov has polled about DeVos\u2019 favorability five times since she was appointed. The most recent poll, in April 2018, found DeVos had the highest \"very unfavorable\" rating (28%).\u00a0\nPolitico/Morning Consult polled about the favorability of DeVos on four occasions since 2017, with the most recent one in the spring of 2018. That poll showed DeVos with a 31% very unfavorable rating, the highest among 15 Cabinet members.\u00a0\nEven though the polls are a little dated, Wilson\u2019s statement is consistent with the evidence, said Washington University political scientist Steven S. Smith.\nEducation Department spokeswoman Angela Morabito told PolitiFact that DeVos isn\u2019t working to win a popularity contest. But she pointed to polling by an education research and policy journal showing growing public support for certain school choice programs.\nRelated: By the numbers: Is college worth the cost?\nOur ruling\nWilson said DeVos is the \"most unpopular person in our government.\"\nTwo polling organizations asking about popularity for about a dozen Trump administration officials back up her statement, though they are a little outdated. We found no polling about the popularity for DeVos in 2019.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17527"}
