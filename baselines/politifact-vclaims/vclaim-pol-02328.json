Among other topics, Trump discussed some of the economic achievements on his watch:\n\"Wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade, something that people have been waiting for, as you know. When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years, and wages effectively went down. Now, for the first time in a long time, they're starting to go up for people.\"\nPreviously, we rated \u00a0a similar statement by Trump about rising wages \"finally\" coming \"after years of wage stagnation\" as Mostly False.\nTrump\u2019s recent statement is more problematic.\nWe looked at the data for what economists say is the best measurement \u2014 median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, 16 years and over. This is a measure that tends to reflect the typical wages of people with stable employment and it is adjusted for inflation.\nThis figure has been calculated quarterly since 1979.\n\nIt might be reasonable to describe the overall wage pattern from the mid 1990s to the mid 2010s as \"stagnant\" or \"unimpressive,\" but it\u2019s not the case that they \"effectively went down\" over those two decades.\nIn July 1994, median inflation-adjusted wages stood at $314. They peaked at $345 in early 2009, right before the Great Recession fully hit wages. That\u2019s an increase of about 10 percent \u2014 not very strong over 15 years, but not a downward path, either.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven after weekly wages bottomed out in mid 2014, they still stood at $330, or 5 percent higher than the decade before. Again -- wages didn\u2019t go down over that two-decade period.\nIs it accurate that for \"the first time in a long time (wages are) starting to go up?\"\nIt is wrong for Trump to say wages are \"now, for the first time in a long time\" increasing under his watch. Wages had already been going up for nearly three years while Barack Obama was president, at a faster pace than the previous two decades.\nThe significant upward trend in wages began in 2014, almost three years before Trump was inaugurated (and even before he had declared his candidacy for president).\nDuring the roughly three years before Trump was sworn in, median real wages rose from $330 a week to $351, or an increase of more than 6 percent.\nOn Trump\u2019s watch, wages initially went up and then fell enough to wipe out the accumulated gains. A few quarters of data can be subject to statistical noise, so there is not much we can say for certain about how Trump\u2019s actions have or have not affected wages. .\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years (when) wages effectively went down. Now, for the first time in a long time, they're starting to go up for people.\"\nWage growth during the two-decade period Trump is referencing was modest, even sluggish, but wages didn\u2019t go down over that period, even accounting for inflation. As for wages finally going up now, they rose for almost three years before Trump took office, so it\u2019s not credible for him to imply that he deserves credit.\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-09 17:24:06 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years (when) wages effectively went down.
