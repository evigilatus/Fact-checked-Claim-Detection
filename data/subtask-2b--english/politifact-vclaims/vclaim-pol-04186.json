Congressional investigations did not find Clinton was inattentive, much less asleep. Rather, she worked into the night after the attacks occurred.\nSeveral days after that fact check was published, the sister of Christopher Stephens, the slain ambassador, said she did not blame Clinton. But Patricia Smith, the mother of one of the other victims, has blamed Clinton.\nAnd Clinton, in part because of her \"What difference does it make?\" remark on the attacks, continues to be a target.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted this on Sept. 26, 2016, a couple of weeks after the fourth anniversary of the attacks:\n\"Repeated requests for additional security in #Benghazi were routinely denied by Secretary Clinton's State Dept.\"\nIn contrast to Trump, the Wisconsin Republican didn\u2019t go quite as personal -- referring to Clinton\u2019s State Department, rather than Clinton herself.\nThat helps his claim.\nPrior fact check\nIn May 2014, ahead of one of the congressional investigations into the Benghazi attacks, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claimed the State Department \"not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur rating was True.\nAs we noted in that article:\n\"There are disagreements about whether State acted reasonably, but that it didn't honor requests for additional security is established fact,\" said Georgetown University adjunct assistant professor Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who is also a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which focuses on foreign policy and national security. \u00a0\nThe State Department has acknowledged it rejected requests to provide more security personnel in Libya. It also acknowledged rejecting a request to erect guard towers at the Benghazi mission, but notes that a number of physical security upgrades, such as the installation of concrete barriers to block unused gates, were made during 2012.\nThe State Department\u2019s own Accountability Review Board concluded that the number of diplomatic security staff in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks was inadequate \"despite repeated requests\" from the Benghazi mission and the embassy in Tripoli for additional staffing.\nIn addition, PolitiFact National has reported that the numerous requests from officials on the ground in Libya for better security for the Benghazi compound are undeniable and well-documented.\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that our colleagues have also pointed out there is no evidence that Clinton herself was aware of the requests, or that she willfully denied them.\nOur rating\nRyan said: \"Repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied\" by Hillary \"Clinton's State Department.\"\nRyan\u2019s claim avoids trouble by focusing on the State Department, then led by Clinton, rather than on Clinton herself. It\u2019s well documented that the department didn\u2019t honor requests for more security prior to the 2012 attacks that killed four Americans.\nWe rate Ryan\u2019s statement True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2bba7888-3630-46d1-ae74-ca5bc3ef249c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04186"}
