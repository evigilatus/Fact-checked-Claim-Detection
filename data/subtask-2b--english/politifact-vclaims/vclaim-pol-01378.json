(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nOccupy Democrats calls itself a political organization and information site that \"provides a new counterbalance to the Republican Tea Party.\" In response to an email seeking more information about the meme, the group said that it didn\u2019t make the graphic but, faced with questions about its accuracy, has edited its description to quote Snopes.\n\"As far as we can tell, the only figure the meme states accurately is Cruz\u2019s salary,\" it says. \"Although the $4.6 million figure cited isn\u2019t implausible, we don\u2019t know how it was arrived at, or by whom. Nor were we able to ascertain where the other amount cited\u2014Cruz\u2019s alleged net worth of $500,000 in 2012\u2014came from.\"\nOccupy Democrats originally fact-checked the $4.6 million figure \"and found it to be generally accurate,\" the group said in an email to PolitiFact on Oct. 24: \"Thank you for reaching out and for allowing us to acknowledge and correct our mistake. We will be more careful in the future when backchecking graphics that we did not create ourselves.\"\nThe Cruz campaign didn\u2019t respond to an email about the Facebook post.\nHere\u2019s what we know\nCruz does make $174,000 annually. All senators have been offered such a paycheck since 2009, when their salaries were increased from $169,300.\nBut, as Abby Livingston of the Texas Tribune reports, it\u2019s impossible to calculate the net worth of candidates for federal office based on their personal financial disclosure forms. That's because they don\u2019t have to report exact amounts of income, financial assets or liabilities.\nBefore winning the Senate in November 2012, Cruz filed a financial disclosure in July of that year showing that he and his wife, Heidi, had assets ranging from about $1.8 million to $4.4 million, according to our analysis. His liabilities ranged from about $900,000 to $2 million.\nUsing these figures, it\u2019s possible that the senator\u2019s net worth was $500,000. If Cruz\u2019s assets were worth $1.8 million, the low end of that range, and his liabilities totaled $2 million, the high end of that range, he would be in the red about $200,000. On the other hand, if his assets were worth $4.4 million and his liabilities $900,000, he could have been worth as much as $3.5 million back then.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that report covered calendar year 2011. Looking at the financial disclosure report Cruz filed in May 2013 for calendar year 2012 \u2014 the year he assumed his position in the Senate \u2014 his assets ranged from about $2.2 million to $5.1 million, and his liabilities ranged from about $750,000 to $1.5 million. The difference between the low end of the range for his assets and the high end of the range of his liabilities is $700,000. But if his assets were on the high end and his liabilities on the low end, the difference would be $4.3 million.\nThe nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics landed on slightly different numbers for 2012, with Cruz's assets ranging from $2.5 million to $5.9 million, leading them to estimate his net worth at $3.47 million.\nSo, can we say, six years later that Cruz\u2019 net worth is up to $4.6 million?\nIn Cruz\u2019s most recent financial report, which was filed in August 2018 but covers calendar year 2017, he listed assets ranging between about $2.2 million and $5 million, from stocks and a retirement plan, among other investments. He listed liabilities ranging from about $1.1 million and $5.4 million. If Cruz\u2019s assets are in fact worth $5 million, the high end of that range, and his liabilities are only $1.1 million, the low end of that range, the most his net worth could be is about $3.9 million \u2014 not the $4.6 million claimed in the original graphic that Occupy Democrats shared.\nWhat other organizations have found\nIt\u2019s hard to pin down lawmakers\u2019 net worth, but some organizations have nonetheless tried \u2014 with a caveat.\nRoll Call, which produces a \"Wealth of Congress\" study, warns its ranking is a window into House and Senate members\u2019 finances but \"far from comprehensive or exact.\" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., is No. 1 on the Roll Call list with an estimated net worth of $283.3 million. The news organization, whose mission is to cover Congress, estimated O\u2019Rourke\u2019s net worth is $3 million, No. 97 among 530 voting senators and representatives in the 115th Congress (2017-2018). Cruz landed at No. 332 with an estimated net worth of about $200,000.\nAnother financial footnote: Heidi Cruz is the managing director of Goldman Sachs in Houston. In a recent profile in The Atlantic, she described herself as the family\u2019s \"primary breadwinner,\" working 70-hour weeks to keep the Cruzes financially afloat.\nWhat do the numbers say about O\u2019Rourke?\nBecause this is a Democratic attack on Cruz, it\u2019s important to look at how his challenger compares. O\u2019Rourke also makes $174,000. He founded a technology company in El Paso and, according to the Tribune, he and his wife most recently listed assets \u2014 including a stake in that company, rental and commercial real estate, and his wife\u2019s trust fund\u2014that could range from $3.5 million to more than $16 million. The couple totaled liabilities between $1.3 million and $5.7 million, the Tribune reports.\nThe Center for Responsive Politics estimated that in 2012, O\u2019Rourke was worth $7.74 million. In 2015, according to the center, O\u2019Rourke had an estimated net worth of nearly $9 million. Cruz, meanwhile, was worth $3.8 million that year, the group\u2019s analysis shows.\nOur ruling\nO\u2019Rourke isn\u2019t an outlier \u2014 Congress has plenty of wealthy members \u2014 but the suggestion that his opponent is making more than his salary in a way that\u2019s unique doesn\u2019t reflect reality.\nAt most, based on the information available in Cruz\u2019s own financial disclosures, his net worth was more than $500,000 when he became a senator in 2012 and he was potentially worth several million. And, based again on the figures he shared in 2018, his net worth is between $1.1 million and 5.7 million.\nThat\u2019s quite a spread \u2014 too much of a spread, we believe, to declare his actual net worth. What\u2019s more, like Snopes, the only figure we could confirm is Cruz\u2019s salary.\u00a0\nWe rate this statement as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01378"}
