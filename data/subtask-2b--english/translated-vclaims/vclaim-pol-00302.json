The original statement was simply, \"People have to shrink their actions as a result of the law.\" The debate over the law on affordable care will not be over any time soon. The Republicans have pledged to make Obama &apos; s care a central theme of the 2014 campaign, while the Democrats insist that the problems arising from the initial roll-out are diminishing and that millions of Americans now have health insurance as a result of the law. At the same time, a new congressional report on the law appears to raise possible arguments from both sides. U.S. Senate candidate Monica Werby recently took a tour of Oregon, meeting with 100 employers in many days. He's running for GOP to confront C. Jeff Merkel, D-Ore. During a stop in La Grande, Wehby said that the new law threatens to disrupt Oregon's efforts to emerge from the Great Depression. \"It's clear that we have a lot of concerns about the healthcare law,\" she said to gather about 15 people at LaGrandi's Caf\u00e9. \"People have to cut down on their business as a result of the law.\" There have been many allegations about affordable care law, but this one has drawn our attention. Does the law cause business to shrink? == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man We called the Wehbe campaign and got a response from Charlie Pierce, her contact manager. In addition to providing links to national news that some major companies are reducing staff hours to avoid ACA insurance costs, we have directed Robert Decker, owner of Westcare Health Management in Salem, a company that runs health-care facilities for veterans and disabled persons in several states. Decker said that the costs associated with the new law prompted him to sell three care facilities in Idaho in 2012. When he examined the figures, he found that it would cost him between $800,000 and $1 million to provide health insurance for the 650 employees he had in Idaho at the time. Decker said that spending that much money on insurance would have made those businesses unprofitable. \"The Health Care Act was a major driving force in our sale of those facilities,\" said Decker. \"It has had a great impact on us, no doubt.\" Two of the company &apos; s supervisors who purchased the bulk of Westcare Management &apos; s property in Idaho confirmed its sale in March 2012. Both refused to give their names, saying that they were not authorized to speak publicly about the transaction. The director of the company's human resources has not responded to our calls. To measure the accuracy of Decker's claim for health-care costs, we contacted T.J. Solivan, a partner of Huggens Insurance in Salem. His agency was advising Oregon companies on how the health-care law would affect them. The average premiums for the Agency &apos; s approved business plans ranged from $250 to $300 per month, with the Administration receiving about half of those premiums. Assuming that the costs of 650 workers per month amount to $125, the costs of the Western Welfare Department under the new law would amount to approximately $975,000 per year. In this regard, Decker &apos; s assertion is confirmed. However, Decker's company was held in private and refused to discuss profits, so we could not independently verify that a cost of between $800,000 and $1 million would make business not profitable. Sullivan said he saw the effects of the new law locally, too. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" \u2022 2 February 2021, one of the sentences, the so-called employer's mandate, was postponed until 2015. It requires businesses that employ more than 50 people - all working at least 30 hours a week - to provide insurance for their employees. However, Sullivan said that he was working with at least one of Salem Area companies in that category, which worked less than 30 hours a week. The company has multiple sites and employs approximately 100 residents of the Salem area. Sullivan, the owner of the company, said that it aimed to reduce working hours to 60 to 75 of these employees under the 30-hour threshold. The owner doesn't hire workers to fill the gap -- he doesn't fire anyone, as Sullivan said. He refused to name the company, saying he wanted the owner to speak for himself. The owner didn't return our calls. But from Sullivan's description, work is \"deterioration.\" A new report by the Budget Office of Congress indicates that the new law will mean losses equivalent to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021 with reduced hours. However, the report contains an important warning that many of these losses will be voluntary because people choose to keep their income low in order to remain eligible for federal health-care benefits or medical aid. We then asked whether government employment data reflect either of the two trends - larger companies that do not employ the 51 employees or smaller companies that employ more part-time employees to avoid health insurance requirements. Not according to a code published in November 6, 2013, by Josh Lehner, Chief Economist of the State Bureau of Economic Analysis. \"Here in Oregon,\" Lehner wrote, \"more than 90% of the jobs added between 2009 and 2012 were full-time jobs, online.\" Later in the post, he added, \"of course, the so-called \"employer's\" mandate under the Health Act\" which did not enter into force until 2015, and therefore employers could simply wait to reduce the hours until they were closer to the deadline. But there is little evidence that has begun so far.\" The clarity of this matter may not come at any time soon. According to Mark McMullen, the economist of Oregon, \"This is one really hard to get to deal with. Even after sufficient time has passed for the effects of the law to appear in the aggregate data, it will be difficult to isolate these effects.\" Oregon, like the rest of the country, is still wrestling with the Affordable Care Act. The two main political parties are divided to a large extent on whether it represents an abuse by the Government or the best way to control health-care spending while providing insurance to those who do not have it. He told Wehbee a small audience in La Grande that \"people have to cut down on their jobs as a result.\" It is true that Wehbe said that companies \"shall\" reduce their operations. There is a difference that indicates that businesses are forced to make cuts. Because we cannot assess motives, we have chosen to look more narrowly at whether or not businesses are being reduced in response to the law, and to accept that the vast majority of businesses will ultimately act as they see fit. The Wehbe campaign provided an example of a significant reduction in business activity in Oregon, although the two aspects cannot be independently verified. It has also given us links to national news reporting similar cuts elsewhere. A consultant in Oregon also outlined an example of reduced working hours as a result of the law.
