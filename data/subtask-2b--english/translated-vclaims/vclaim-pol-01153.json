The State Election Council is investigating voting irregularities in the race between Republicans Mark Harris and Democratic Dan McCreedy, who left the seat vacant in Congress. :: Complex issues: legal withdrawal of the war between Goff. Roy Cooper and the Republican-led legislature recently left the election office without members of the Governing Council. In order to rectify this situation, the legislators last month approved a bill that will establish a new electoral council on 31 January. The Democrats reacted suspiciously to the draft law, claiming that it affected the transparency of investigations into electoral fraud. The NCP cannot keep their story straight. They attacked S.P.O. because of a lack of transparency. Now, they are messing with a provision that would make investigations like #NC09 * less transparent, \"The North Carolina Democratic Party wrote on Twitter on December 27. Cooper vetoed the bill and the legislature exceeded the veto on December 27, creating the new Council. Is it true that the National Convention General Assembly has passed legislation that would reduce the transparency of investigations such as those in Harris McCready's findings? In order to assess the claim of the NC Democratic Party, we must consider the nature of that investigation. As the Poletti Fukte newspaper noted in the recent fact-finding of the North Carolina Republican Party, the State Electoral Council has not revealed much about the scope of its investigations, which are still under way. But it seems to focus on possible fraud in post-absence cards. This does not affect the electoral fraud carried out by Polyte Fact with the review of the draft law, and has found no evidence that it conceals the investigation of electoral fraud. The fifth part of the draft law, which deals with investigations of fraud in the absentee ballot, does not mention anything about confidentiality. He states: \"By 1 April 2019, the State Electoral Council shall submit a report and recommendations to the Joint Commission for Monitoring of Legislative Elections and Ethics on the forgery of absent ballot papers. The report addresses all of the following: (1) Efforts to identify and investigate possible cases of mail collection of ballot papers. (2) Data and statistics on the number of requests for blank ballots by mail, the number of absent ballots returned by mail during the last five electoral cycles and any trends or patterns reflected in the analysis of those data and statistics. (3) Any other relevant matter identified by the Council of State affecting the absentee ballot.\" However, the law requires that investigations into potential violations of campaign financing be confidential. It just makes campaign financing investigations confidential. It's not election fraud, according to Jerry Cohen, the former N.C. Special Adviser and a long-time legislative officer. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 On 1 February 2021, David Lewis, a Republican in Harnett County, was a senior negotiator in the bill. That affected investigations into the financing of electoral campaigns, not allegations of other violations of the electoral law. That could increase transparency. \"First, section V of the House of Representatives Bill 1029 requires the State Electoral Council to submit an official report to the General Assembly on the problems of absentee voting in the past few years. There is no foreseeable reason why the report was not published. \"Louis said in an e-mail to Poletti Fruitte. \"Second, section 4.9 requests additional information on absent ballots to be forwarded to the Council of State, which usually makes all such information public.\" So how does the law affect the campaign's financial violations? Previously, the Electoral Council had confirmed the existence of investigations into campaign financing, as reported by the N&O newspaper. However, under the new law, an investigation can only become widely known if the charges have been brought or the person who charged has been made public. Robert Howard, spokesman for the Democratic Party N.C. believes that the investigation in the Ninth District can reveal violations of campaign funding. \"On the basis of materials issued by the State Electoral Council and statements made by the population under NC-09, there is a clear reason to believe (the political agent of the province of Bladen) Makray Daulis and others may have committed violations of campaign financing in addition to operating an illegal vote collection scheme,\" Howard said in an e-mail. \"This year, NCGOP, Harris Campaign, and Red Dome Group either contracted or subcontracted Dowless who then operated a paid collection process, often paid to employees in cash.\" \"If an investigation such as NC09 involves violations of campaign financing and a separate violation (such as, in this case, the collection of illegal votes), investigators who have been forced by this law to keep confidential the campaign financing violation may also be forced to maintain the confidentiality of the full investigation.\" Howard has a point. The material disclosed by the State Electoral Council refers to possible financial violations. However, while it is true that the Council can find violations of campaign funding as part of its own investigation, questions about bribery are not the announced delay in the 9th region race. In a press statement issued on 30 November, the Council stated that it reviewed \"the irregularities and fraudulent activities related to postal voting and other possible issues in the ninth congressional circuit competition.\" Irrespective of what these \"other things\" may be, NC's tweet gives the impression that the draft law obscures investigations into electoral fraud - which is not happening. Our ruling on the N.C. Democratic Party is that legislators supported a ruling that \"makes investigations like #NC09 less transparent.\" The bill, which has now become law, is likely to conceal allegations of violations of campaign financing. However, it does not affect the disclosure of information related to electoral fraud investigations. We're assessing this mostly wrong.
