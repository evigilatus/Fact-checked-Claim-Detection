We\u2019ll focus on just one of those statements. \"And in another bill that same year, you were the only vote in the entire state Senate against keeping repeat drunk drivers off the road,\" Cornilles said.\n\nHouse Bill 2238, now law, increased the penalty for refusing to take a breath test. Before the legislation, a person who refused could qualify for a hardship driving permit after 90 days or maybe one year, depending on the driver\u2019s previous record. Now, the minimum is 90 days \u2014 and the maximum is three years.\n\nBonamici was the only no vote in Senate committee and on the Senate floor. Her campaign manager Carol Butler said Bonamici wanted to stop people from driving drunk in the first place, not fiddle with legislation that addressed the problem after the fact.\n\nIn her five years in the Legislature, Bonamici has voted for many bills that crack down on drunk driving. But in this instance, Cornilles is correct. She was the sole no vote. We rate the statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11787"}
