Trump cut it off with his index finger in the air, and he was just making fun of it, Rosie O'Donnell. When the roar of the crowd settled, Kelly followed. Your Twitter account contains several offensive comments about the appearance of women. I once told a celebrity school contestant that it would be a \"beautiful picture\" to see her on her knees. Does this sound like the mood of the man we should elect as president? How will you answer the charge of Hillary Clinton, who is likely to be a democratic candidate, that you are part of the \"war on women\"? Trump, who only had to insult Rosie O'Donnell's comedy, desecrated Kelly after the discussion - saying that she \"acted very badly,\" said that \"her blood comes out of her eyes, her blood comes out of her wherever he is,\" and sharing the Twitter article he referred to as \"Bambo\" - merely raised the debate about whether he posed a catastrophic threat to the Gobble Party. NBC host Chuck Todd tried to get Trump to understand why his comments were sexist, and she mentioned the New York Times columnist Gail Collins and Pete Medler as other examples of times he sought out a woman's \"views.\" \"Well, some of the things she said, I didn't say, okay?\" Trump said about Kelly. \"I went through a complete list. And that's a first question, for fuck's sake, by the way. But I'm going to say this, the people you're talking about have attacked me.\" We decided to check whether Kelly said things that Trump didn't say and to look at the context of some of his other arguments with prominent women. A spokesman for the Trump campaign could not be reached for comment. \"Fat pig,\" \"slop\" and \"animal\" Kelly said that Trump referred to women as \"fat pigs\" and \"slop.\" As he admitted during the discussion, Trump corrected both the cadres in O'Donnell, the comedian, and the former team member of The View. On 29 December 2006, the first interview was shook by Fox News, while imagine how O'Donnell's ex-wife Kelly explained the relationship between the couple and her parents. \"Can you imagine Kelly's parents... when she said, 'Mom, Dad, I just fell in love with a big, fat pig named Rosie?\" he said. Trump also referred to O'Donnell as \"animal\" and \"slop\" in 2006. Therefore, it is clear that insults occurred because of the comments made by O'Donnell at The View on December 20, 2006. After Trump announced that he would not expel the winner of the Miss United States of America accused of drug abuse, underage drinking and \"sexual recklessness,\" O'Donnell criticized Trump's personal and professional dealings, pointing out that a few Trump companies had been bankrupt in the past and called him \"mint oil salesman.\" O'Donnell also regretted Trump's appearance as \"ethical authority\" in the scandal, referring to his divorces as evidence that he should not be considered \"a model for 20-year-olds of the nation.\" He said \"dog\" Kelly Trump called women \"dogs.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman on January 11, 2021, one incident, as Todd mentioned, refers to an insult he allegedly directed to Gale Collins, a liberal newspaper writer for the New York Times who interviewed Trump during his first years as a developer. In 2011 Collins wrote in the Thames column, \"It's very sensitive to any Gibbs about his business record, which has been up and down over the years. In one low period, I referred to him in a print as a 'Alveer Financial Fighter', and he sent me a copy of the column with my circular picture and 'Dogface' written on it. We were not able to independently verify Collins' claim, or look for her original story from Trump's \"downtime.\" But Trump sent a similar language to Ariana Hovington on Twitter in April. Kelly also referred to Trump &apos; s treatment of a lawyer during a lawsuit concerning one of his developments in Florida. In a 2011 lawsuit, Elizabeth Beck, a lawyer representing Trump's opponents, requested a medical break, stating that she had to pump breast milk for her three-month-old daughter. But Trump objected, and he called Beck \"disgusting\" when the pump came out. Trump left the certificate, and the proceedings were suspended today. Trump once traded the singer and actress Pete Medler, as Todd pointed out in \"Meet the Press.\" In 2012, Medler wrote about Trump: \"The man who destroyed New York seeks to destroy the nation.\" Madeler deleted the tweet, but he later referred to it as \"stupid,\" and called his haircut \"wretched artwork,\" someone convinced him. Trump responded by calling Midler \"disgusting,\" as well as \"Grotsky,\" \"ugly,\" and a bad singer. We couldn't find documents about the exact time he said \"disgusting animal,\" but he used both words. Another observation was made in 2013 during an episode of Tramp's Realistic Program entitled \"Celebrity Apprenticeships.\" During a sentencing session with Trump, Rock Brett Michaels described the former contestant, Playboy, the playmate of Brand Roderick, as \"falling down on her knees\" and begging not to fire her. \"Excuse me,\" said Trump. \"Did you fall on your knees?\" \"Yes,\" Roderick said. \"It must be a beautiful picture, you're falling on your knees,\" said Trump. Our governor Trump said that he \"didn't say\" some things about the women Kelly talked about. However, the record shows that the opposite is true. He said exactly what Kelly said in the discussion. We also appreciate Trump's false establishment. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9520c998-b1af-4223-a6b2-7acb3ccb9c9 9", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06088"}
