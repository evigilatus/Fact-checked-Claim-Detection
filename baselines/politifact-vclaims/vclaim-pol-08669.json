Just what numbers was he using?\nAbele\u2019s office first pointed us to state population trends from 2010 to 2012 showing a gain for Wisconsin. But that didn\u2019t address his claim about Milwaukee and the country. What\u2019s more, Abele\u2019s state data showed that 49 states gained population from 2010 to 2012, based on the most recent estimates.\nSo, virtually no one went down.\nThere\u2019s another problem: The figures he shared with us were based on annual population estimates by the Census Bureau, not the full census -- the nose count that occurs every 10 years, most recently in April 2010.\nAbele\u2019s \"last census\" reference may have been to the estimates, not the actual census. But as we\u2019ll see it doesn\u2019t change the accuracy of his claim.\nLet\u2019s look at the population numbers, starting with the last full census.\nMilwaukee\u2019s population change\nFirst, we checked population figures for the city, for Milwaukee County and for the Milwaukee metro area, comparing the 2000 census with the 2010 census.\nCity: Milwaukee lost about 2,000 people, coming in at 594,833. So, it actually shrunk a bit, by 0.4 percent.\nMilwaukee County: It grew by 0.8 percent, landing at 947,735.\nMetro area: The four-county metro region added about 55,000 people, or 3.7 percent, landing at 1,555,908.\nThe national picture\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we examined census data on other large urban areas, again noting the change in population in the decade.\nCities: Only Chicago, Detroit, Memphis and Baltimore lost ground among the 25 largest cities. In the next tier of 25, Milwaukee joined Cleveland (-17.1 percent) and Oakland (-2.2) on the downside. So the vast majority gained population, with \u00a019 cities adding more than 10 percent.\nCounties: Forty-four of the top 50 most-populous counties gained population. In fact, Milwaukee County\u2019s gain was one of the smallest on a percentage basis in that group.\nMetros: Forty-five of the top 50 metropolitan areas grew. The big winners included Raleigh, N.C.; Austin, Tex.; Charlotte, N.C.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Orlando, Fla.; Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif.; and Phoenix, Ariz.\nIt\u2019s clear from the data that most urban areas grew or at least held steady, contrary to Abele\u2019s claim.\nAnd the modest growth in the Milwaukee metro region, though rivaling the Los Angeles and New York City areas, was at the very low end among large urban areas.\nA Census Bureau report on the 2000-2010 trend among some 900 metro and \"micro areas\" confirmed that growth was widespread, though slower than in the 1990s. A \"micro area\" contains an urban core of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 people, according to the federal definition.\n\"Population growth of at least twice the national rate occurred in many metro and micro areas, such as some areas in parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas. No metro area in the West region declined,\" the 2010 Census report said.\nAmong counties, the report said, \"the counties that lost population were mostly regionally clustered and mirrored decades of population loss for those areas.\"\nFor example, there were population declines in many Appalachian counties in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia; many Great Plains counties in the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas; and a group of counties in and around the Mississippi Delta.\nNotably, the report found that \"many counties along the Great Lakes and on the northern U.S. border either lost population or grew below 10 percent.\"\nAfter we completed our fact check, Abele\u2019s office got back to us again.\nThis time, we were told Abele had been referring specifically to the city of Milwaukee, and the small estimated gain it made between the 2010 census and 2012.\nIt\u2019s true that annual census estimates since the full 2010 census show the city of Milwaukee growing slightly, by about 2,000 people.\nBut gains in that two-year post-census period were common, even among cities that saw declines from 2000 to 2010, based on media reports and the Census Bureau estimates released for 2011 and 2012.\nIn 2011, for example, the Census Bureau noted that \"overall, the population in cities grew by 1.0 percent across the nation between 2010 and 2011. However, large cities (285) tended to grow faster than the national rate at 1.3 percent.\"\nAbele spokesman Brendan Conway conceded his boss would have been more accurate had he referred specifically to the Great Lakes Area cities and population growth.\nOur rating\nAbele contended that \"We\u2019re one of the only communities in the country that didn\u2019t lose population in the last census.\"\nHowever you cut it, he\u2019s way off base. This claim, given that fast growth in certain regions of the U.S. is well-established and well-known, ventures into ridiculous territory.\nPants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08669"}
