Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!\"\nWe fact-checked a similar claim in a November Trump tweet and rated it False:\n\"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\" Trump charged.\nWe'll review the facts on what causes California's fires, and rate Trump's latest claim.\nOur research\nCalifornia\u2019s firestorms aren\u2019t caused by just one factor. Instead, climate change, forest management and urban sprawl all contribute, according to forestry, fire and climate experts. \u00a0\u00a0\nThinning out forests, setting prescribed burns and clearing brush can help reduce the severity of fires. But California\u2019s stronger winds, higher temperatures and drier conditions, all attributed to climate change, make fires worse. So does the fact that more people and power lines are now situated in forested areas, increasing the chances of sparking an inferno.\n\"It is a complex situation. Simple pronouncements on a subject like this are almost always in error,\" Keith Gilless, a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, told us in November.\nAdditionally, Trump\u2019s claim suggests the state controls most forest management decisions. In reality, California owns\u00a0just 2 percent of forest land in the state while the federal government owns upwards of 60 percent. \u00a0\nThe rest is owned by private landowners, timber companies and Native American tribes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov.

While forest health can be a contributing factor in large fires, more than 60 percent of these forests are controlled by the federal government, not California. And yet, the federal government has cut $2 billion from the US Forest Service even as California has spent more on forest management.\"\nMeanwhile, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who represents Butte County where the Camp Fire destroyed 14,000 homes and killed 86 people in November, said he shares \"the President\u2019s great frustration with California\u2019s choking regulations from the stranglehold environmental groups have on the state,\" and the need for more forest management.\nThe congressman added, however, \"the immediate problem for fire victims is the first need, and threats to FEMA funding are not helpful and will not solve the longer term forest management regulatory problems.\"\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the president\u2019s threat, saying on Twitter:\n\"Mr. President -- Just yesterday, @OregonGovBrown, (and Washington) @GovInslee, and I sent a letter asking the federal government to work with us in taking on these unprecedented wildfires. We have been put in office by the voters to get things done, not to play games with lives.\"\nOur ruling\nPresident Trump claimed California\u2019s deadly wildfires \"would never happen\" with \"proper Forest Management.\"\nExperts on climate, forestry and firefighting all rejected a similar assertion by Trump in November, calling it overly simplistic. They said forest management is just one element, while climate change and urban sprawl are also key contributors.\nTrump has, once again, erroneously placed the blame on just one factor.\nWe rate his latest claim False, as well. \u00a0\nWe rate the claim False.\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2019-01-10 00:20:16 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  California\u2019s deadly wildfires \"would never happen\" with \"proper Forest Management.\"    Donald Trump U.S. President https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1083022011574747137    Wednesday, January 9, 2019 2019-01-09    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01140"}
