Dan Patrick of Houston, who's in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the party's lieutenant governor nomination with incumbent David Dewhurst, have talked about not putting language supportive of a guest-worker program in this year\u2019s party platform, which is to be finalized by delegates to the next state convention in June 2014. Patrick has stumped on securing the Texas-Mexico border, also objecting in a Jan. 25, 2014, Twitter post to the \"illegal invasion.\"\nThe Express-News story described Patterson, the state land commissioner since 2003, as saying he was the only statewide elected official to speak in favor of the guest-worker plank at the June 2012 state convention where it was initially adopted. Patterson separately said on his 2014 campaign website: \"Many of my elected colleagues privately expressed support, but told me that they just couldn\u2019t take the risk.\"\nDid Patterson, who often flies his own plane between cities, venture solo in this way?\nImmigration in 2012 platform\nThe immigration plank, on page 21 of the platform, states that mass deportation of all the undocumented individuals in the United States \"would neither be equitable nor practical,\" while \"blanket amnesty\" would only encourage more illegal entries. The plank also calls for securing the border, modernizing Social Security cards and limiting birthright citizenship to babies born to a U.S. citizen.\nFinally, the plank calls for a temporary worker program \"to bring skilled and unskilled workers into the United States for temporary periods of time when no U.S. workers are currently available,\" to be self-funded through participation fees and fines, the plank says.\nThe guest-worker plank was characterized by proponents at the time as a meaningful breakthrough for the state party.\nA June 9, 2012, Texas Tribune news story quoted TexasGOPvote.com's Bob Price, a convention delegate, as saying adoption of the guest-worker provisions \"takes away a tool that Democrats have used for years to drive a wedge between conservative Hispanics and Republicans.\"\nWilliam Kelberlan, a delegate from Williamson County, told the Tribune: \"It was a tough pill to swallow; it didn't go down easily.\" Kelberlan said he recognized the need for immigration reform but thought more time was needed to hammer out the details of what form it should take.\nPatterson spoke in favor of the guest-worker plank, according to the story, but it was silent on whether he was the sole statewide elected official to do so.\nPatterson invokes 'cojones'\nTo our inquiry, Patterson indicated he remembers his solo status well.\n\"Ain\u2019t much to elaborate,\" he said by email. Asked if he\u2019d heard the speeches given by other statewide elected officials and why he knows he was alone in this regard, Patterson replied: \"I know all the statewides. I know what they do and say. I know who has cojones\" (um, courage) \"and who doesn't. I was the only one.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy email, Steve Munisteri, the party chairman, confirmed Patterson was the only statewide elected official to speak during floor debate of the guest-worker plank and then only after delegates agreed to let him do so, Munisteri said.\nSeparately, Brad Bailey told us he helped draft the relevant language as a delegate from Senate District 11 in Houston. By phone, Bailey said Patterson was alone among statewide elected officials in speaking about the guest-worker section.\nMain speeches lacked mention of guest-worker idea\nWe didn't have to take anyone's word for this.\nMunisteri reminded us the party placed video recordings of the convention online. So we watched the speeches given by several statewide elected officials: U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn; Gov. Rick Perry; Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; Attorney General Greg Abbott; Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples and State Comptroller Susan Combs. None \u2014 plus Patterson, in his main speech to the convention \u2014 aired support for a guest-worker law. In fact, only Staples mentioned conditions near the Texas-Mexico border.\nPatterson spoke from floor during platform debate\nBut as delegates discussed the party platform, Patterson stepped to a microphone on the convention floor after Munisteri adjudged that two-thirds of the delegates, by a show of hands, had agreed to suspend the rules to let him join the conversation even though he wasn\u2019t a delegate. (Hear Patterson\u2019s remarks starting about the 11:15 mark of the video here.)\nPatterson opened by describing himself as a conservative who believes the platform\u2019s immigration plank and border security \"go hand in hand.\"\nHe then said he supported the then-pending state law requiring most voters to present photo identification at the polls as well as initiatives stressing English as the state\u2019s primary language. Patterson said he also supported a physical barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border, including a fence in some cases. He added that he opposed \"unconditional birthright citizenship,\" bilingual \"balance\" and restrictions on police officers asking someone\u2019s immigration status during an apprehension or investigation of a crime. Further, he said, he was opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants.\nBut, Patterson said, \"I will tell you\u2026 that I very loudly, firmly and with great fervor support\u2026 a guest-worker program as part of our border security.\"\n\"We have folks in this country who are here to do us harm,\" Patterson said. \"They are criminal, they are coyotes, they run things back and across the border whether they are illegals, whether they are drugs or contraband.\n\"And we also have folks in this country,\" Patterson continued, \"who want to work hard, pay their taxes, obey our laws. And there is no way for those to come here and do that lawfully because our immigration system is broken. We need a guest-worker, temporary guest-worker program that is in the immigration plank in our platform,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nPatterson said he was unique among statewide elected officials in speaking for the guest-worker section that became part of the Republican Party of Texas platform in 2012.\nTrue.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08025"}
