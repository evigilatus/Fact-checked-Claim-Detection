0001	Donald Trump	Well, thank you very much, everybody.
0002	Donald Trump	Appreciate it.
0003	Donald Trump	We've had a very amazing twoday period in Brussels.
0004	Donald Trump	And we really accomplished a lot, with respect to NATO.
0005	Donald Trump	For years, Presidents have been coming to these meetings and talked about the expense  the tremendous expense for the United States.
0006	Donald Trump	And tremendous progress has been made everyone has agreed to substantially up their commitment.
0007	Donald Trump	They're going to up it at levels that they've never thought of before.
0008	Donald Trump	Prior to last year, where I attended my first meeting, it was going down  the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially.
0009	Donald Trump	And now, it's going up very substantially.
0010	Donald Trump	And commitments were made.
0011	Donald Trump	Only 5 of 29 countries were making their commitment.
0012	Donald Trump	And that's now changed.
0013	Donald Trump	The commitment was at 2 percent.
0014	Donald Trump	Ultimately, that'll be going up quite a bit higher than that.
0015	Donald Trump	So we are  we made a tremendous amount of progress today.
0016	Donald Trump	It's been about, at a minimum, they estimate  and they're going to be giving you exact numbers  but since last year, they've raise an additional $33 billion that's been put up by the various countries, not including the United States.
0017	Donald Trump	And the United States' commitment to NATO is very strong, remains very strong, but primarily because everyone  the spirit they have, the amount of money they're willing to spend, the additional money that they will be putting up has been really, really amazing to see it.
0018	Donald Trump	To see the level of spirit in that room is incredible.
0019	Donald Trump	And I hope that we're going to be able to get along with Russia.
0020	Donald Trump	I think that we probably will be able to.
0021	Donald Trump	The people in the room think so, but they nevertheless  they really stepped up their commitment, and stepped it up like they never have before. So took in an addition $33
0022	SYSTEM	[billion]
0023	Donald Trump	. The number could actually be higher than $40
0024	SYSTEM	[billion]
0025	Donald Trump	when they give you the final number.
0026	Donald Trump	The Secretary General, Stoltenberg, will be giving those numbers sometime today, probably in his concluding press statement.
0027	Donald Trump	But we are doing numbers like they've never done before or ever seen before.
0028	Donald Trump	And you'll be seeing that, and I guess you'll be hearing that a little bit later.
0029	Donald Trump	Okay.
0030	Donald Trump	We have our Secretary of State, as you know, and we have  John is here.
0031	Donald Trump	So if you have any questions for the three of us.
0032	Donald Trump	Mike Pompeo just got back from a third trip, as you know, to North Korea.
0033	Donald Trump	He's become a true expert on the trips to North Korea  the best way to get there, the best way to get out.
0034	Donald Trump	And he gets along very well.
0035	Donald Trump	And he's doing a great job over there.
0036	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.
0037	Question	I have a question.
0038	Donald Trump	Yes.
0039	Tara McKelvey	Mr. President, I'm Tara McKelvey with the BBC.
0040	Tara McKelvey	Can you tell us whether or not you warned people that the U.S. would pull out of NATO if they weren't meeting their spending goals?
0041	Donald Trump	I told people that I'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their commitments very substantially, because the United States has been paying a tremendous amount, probably 90 percent of the cost of NATO.
0042	Donald Trump	And now, people are going to start and countries are going to start upping their commitments.
0043	Donald Trump	So I let them know yesterday, actually.
0044	Donald Trump	I was surprised that you didn't pick it up it took until today.
0045	Donald Trump	But yesterday, I let them know that I was extremely unhappy with what was happening, and they have substantially upped their commitment, yeah.
0046	Donald Trump	And now we're very happy and have a very, very powerful, very, very strong NATO, much stronger than it was two days ago.
0047	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.
0048	Question	Hi, President Trump.
0049	Donald Trump	Yes, hi.
0050	Donald Trump	How are you?
0051	Question	I'm the White House Correspondent for PBS 
0052	Donald Trump	I know.
0053	Donald Trump	You're very famous on television.
0054	Question	I have a question, again, about  did you ever, at any point, say that the U.S., though, might stop engaging with NATO?
0055	Question	And do you think that your rhetoric helps NATO cohesion, or are you worried that people might think that U.S. might not be as committed to NATO?
0056	Question	There are a lot of people who say they were worried and stressed by what you did yesterday.
0057	Donald Trump	Well, they were probably worried because the United States was not being treated fairly, but now we are, because the commitment has been upped so much.
0058	Donald Trump	So now they are.
0059	Donald Trump	And I was very firm yesterday.
0060	Donald Trump	You have to understand, I know a lot of the people in the room.
0061	Donald Trump	I was here last year.
0062	Donald Trump	I let them know last year  in a less firm manner, but pretty firm  and they raised an additional $33 billion, I think going to $40 billion.
0063	Donald Trump	But it's $33 billion as of today.
0064	Donald Trump	And then today and yesterday, I was probably a little bit more firm.
0065	Donald Trump	But I believe in NATO.
0066	Donald Trump	I think NATO is a very important  probably the greatest ever done.
0067	Donald Trump	But the United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of it, depending on the way you calculate.
0068	Donald Trump	That's not fair to the United States.
0069	Donald Trump	In addition to that, as you know, we're in negotiations with the EU, and we're going to be meeting with them next week.
0070	Donald Trump	We've been treated very unfairly on trade.
0071	Donald Trump	Our farmers have been shut out of the European Union.
0072	Donald Trump	Now, you could say they're different, but basically, to a large extent, they're the same countries.
0073	Donald Trump	So I think we're going to be ultimately treated fairly on trade.
0074	Donald Trump	We'll see what happens, but I can tell you that NATO now is really a finetuned machine.
0075	Donald Trump	People are paying money that they never paid before.
0076	Donald Trump	They're happy to do it.
0077	Donald Trump	And the United States is being treated much more fairly.
0078	Donald Trump	Yes, sir.
0079	Ryan Chilcote	President Trump, Ryan Chilcote, PBS NewsHour.
0080	Ryan Chilcote	Did you win concessions in your meetings and discussions with the German Chancellor when it comes to German defense spending and also with this issue of purchasing energy from Russia?
0081	Ryan Chilcote	And secondly, what would you say to your critics that say by creating this scene here at NATO you're only enabling President Putin and Russia to further disturb things in Ukraine and Georgia?
0082	Donald Trump	Well, if you consider putting up tremendously  you know, the additional funds at a level that nobody has ever seen before, I don't think that's helping Russia.
0083	Donald Trump	I think that NATO is much stronger now than it was two days ago.
0084	Donald Trump	I think that NATO was not doing what they were supposed to be doing  a lot of the countries.
0085	Donald Trump	And we were doing much more than we should have been doing.
0086	Donald Trump	Frankly, we were carrying too much of a burden.
0087	Donald Trump	That's why we call it "burdensharing."
0088	Donald Trump	I was using the term a lot today.
0089	Donald Trump	Burdensharing.
0090	Donald Trump	We had a fantastic meeting at the end  29 countries.
0091	Donald Trump	And they are putting up a lot.
0092	Donald Trump	Germany has increased very substantially their time period, and Germany is coming along.
0093	Donald Trump	And we still have to figure out what's going on with the pipeline, because the pipeline is coming in from Russia.
0094	Donald Trump	So we're going to have to figure that out.
0095	Donald Trump	I brought it up nobody brought it up but me, and we all are talking about it now.
0096	Donald Trump	And actually, I think the world is talking about it now maybe more than anything else.
0097	Donald Trump	But we're going to figure that out.
0098	Donald Trump	But  and, frankly, maybe everybody is going to have a good relationship with Russia so there will be a lot less problem with the pipeline.
0099	Donald Trump	But, to me, that was a very major point of contention.
0100	Donald Trump	We discussed it at length today.
0101	Donald Trump	Germany has agreed to do a lot better than they were doing, and we're very happy with that.
0102	Donald Trump	We had a very good relationship with Angela Merkel.
0103	Donald Trump	Yes.
0104	Margaret Talev	Mr. President 
0105	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.
0106	Margaret Talev	Hi.
0107	Margaret Talev	Thank you.
0108	Margaret Talev	Margaret Talev from Bloomberg.
0109	Donald Trump	Yes.
0110	Donald Trump	After all these years, I know, Margaret.
0111	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0112	Margaret Talev	Thank you.
0113	Margaret Talev	Maybe I'm being dense here, but could you just clarify Are you still threatening to potentially pull the United States out of NATO for any reason?
0114	Margaret Talev	And do you believe you can do that without Congress's explicit support and approval?
0115	Donald Trump	I think I probably can, but that's unnecessary.
0116	Donald Trump	And the people have stepped up today like they've never stepped up before.
0117	Donald Trump	And remember the word  $33 billion more, they're paying.
0118	Donald Trump	And you'll hear that from the Secretary General in a little while.
0119	Donald Trump	He thanked me actually.
0120	Donald Trump	He actually thanked me.
0121	Donald Trump	And everybody in the room thanked me.
0122	Donald Trump	There's a great collegial spirit in that room that I don't think they've had in many years.
0123	Donald Trump	They're very strong.
0124	Donald Trump	So, yeah, very unified, very strong.
0125	Donald Trump	No problem.
0126	Donald Trump	Right?
0127	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead.
0128	Jonathan Lemire	We're in NATO.
0129	Jonathan Lemire	No  no 
0130	Donald Trump	No problem.
0131	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0132	Jonathan Lemire	Mr. President, Jonathan Lemire with the Associated Press.
0133	Jonathan Lemire	You have said previously you wanted the countries to step up their spending to 2 percent.
0134	Jonathan Lemire	Yesterday there was a suggestion it might be 4 percent, or perhaps 2 percent at a much quicker timetable.
0135	Jonathan Lemire	Can you clarify, what did they commit to doing?
0136	Jonathan Lemire	Is that satisfactory to you?
0137	Donald Trump	So what they're doing is spending at a much faster clip.
0138	Donald Trump	They're going up to the 2 percent level.
0139	Donald Trump	Now, you have to understand, some of them have parliaments, they have their own congresses, they have a lot of things they have to go through.
0140	Donald Trump	So, you know, they're here as prime minister or a as a president, and they can't necessarily go in and say, this is what we're going to do.
0141	Donald Trump	But they're going back for approvals.
0142	Donald Trump	Some are at 2 percent others have agreed definitely to go to 2 percent.
0143	Donald Trump	And some are going back to get the approval, and which they will get, to go to 2 percent.
0144	Donald Trump	After the 2 percent, we'll start talking about going higher.
0145	Donald Trump	But I said, ultimately we should be, in years  in advance  we should be at 4 percent.
0146	Donald Trump	I think 4 percent, it's the right number.
0147	Donald Trump	Now, the United States  depending on the way you calculate it  was at 4.2 percent.
0148	Donald Trump	And I said, that's unfair.
0149	Donald Trump	And we have the largest GDP by far, especially since we've increased it by so much since a thing called the election.
0150	Donald Trump	Our GDP has gone way up.
0151	Donald Trump	And so the fact that our GDP went way up, that means we're paying for even more, which is very unfair.
0152	Donald Trump	So I explained that.
0153	Donald Trump	We will go to much higher than 2 percent into the future, but right now we're getting people up to 2 percent, and that will take place over a fairly short period of time  a short number of years.
0154	Donald Trump	Okay?
0155	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead. Hi, Tomas LeCrass from
0156	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0157	Donald Trump	journalist Croatia Daily Newspaper.
0158	Tomas LeCrass	We understand your message 
0159	Donald Trump	Congratulations, by the way.
0160	Tomas LeCrass	Thank you.
0161	Donald Trump	On soccer.
0162	Tomas LeCrass	Thank you.
0163	Tomas LeCrass	We understand your message, but some people ask themselves, will you be tweeting differently once you board the Air Force One?
0164	Tomas LeCrass	Thank you.
0165	Donald Trump	No, that's other people that do that.
0166	Donald Trump	I don't.
0167	Donald Trump	I'm very consistent.
0168	Donald Trump	I'm a very stable genius.
0169	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0170	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0171	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.
0172	Jeremy Diamond	Thank you, sir.
0173	Jeremy Diamond	Jeremy Diamond with CNN.
0174	Jeremy Diamond	How are you?
0175	Donald Trump	Hi, Jeremy.
0176	Jeremy Diamond	Quick question with regards to Germany and the comments that you made yesterday.
0177	Jeremy Diamond	Do you feel like given the threats that you made about potentially leaving NATO, about insulting Germany's sovereignty, it appears, by suggesting that they're totally controlled by Russia  do you feel like that's an effective way to conduct diplomacy?
0178	Jeremy Diamond	And secondly, would you be able to be a little bit more specific about the commitments that you secured today with regards to increasing the financial commitment?
0179	Jeremy Diamond	Is there an updated timeline?
0180	Jeremy Diamond	Are there specific countries you could cite?
0181	Jeremy Diamond	Because a majority of them were already planning to meet that 2 percent threshold by 2024.
0182	Donald Trump	No, many of them  in fact, Germany was going to be in the year 2028 or '30.
0183	Donald Trump	Yeah, I think it's a very effective way to deal, but I didn't deal exactly the way you said.
0184	Donald Trump	I have great respect for Germany.
0185	Donald Trump	My father is from Germany.
0186	Donald Trump	Both of my parents are from the EU, despite the fact they don't treat us well on trade.
0187	Donald Trump	But I think that will change also, and I think we'll see that  because on the 25th of July, they're coming in to start negotiations with me.
0188	Donald Trump	We'll see.
0189	Donald Trump	And if they don't negotiate in good faith, we'll do something having to do with all of the millions of cars that are coming into our country and being taxed at a virtually zero level, at a very low level.
0190	Donald Trump	But, Jeremy, I think it's been a very effective way of negotiating.
0191	Donald Trump	But I'm not negotiating I just want fairness for the United States.
0192	Donald Trump	We're paying for far too much of NATO.
0193	Donald Trump	NATO is very important.
0194	Donald Trump	But NATO is helping Europe more than it's helping us.
0195	Donald Trump	At the same time, it's very good for us.
0196	Donald Trump	So we have now got it to a point where people are paying a lot more money, and that's starting  really, last year.
0197	Donald Trump	It really had  you were there last year.
0198	Donald Trump	And last year we had a big impact.
0199	Donald Trump	Again, we took in $33 billion more.
0200	Donald Trump	And if you ask Secretary General Stoltenberg, he gives us total credit  meaning me, I guess, in this case, total credit  because I said it was unfair.
0201	Donald Trump	Now, what has happened is, presidents over many years, from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, they came in, they said, "Okay, hey, do the best you can," and they left.
0202	Donald Trump	Nobody did anything about it.
0203	Donald Trump	And it got to a point where the United States was paying for 90 percent of NATO.
0204	Donald Trump	And that's not fair.
0205	Donald Trump	So it's changed
0206	Donald Trump	We had a really good meeting today.
0207	Donald Trump	We had a great meeting in terms of getting along.
0208	Donald Trump	I know most of the people in the room because of last year, because of the year and a half that we've been in office  year and a halfplus.
0209	Donald Trump	But we have a great relationship.
0210	Donald Trump	Everybody in that room, by the time we left, got along.
0211	Donald Trump	And they agreed to pay more, and they agreed to pay it more quickly.
0212	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead, Phil.
0213	Philip Rucker	Thanks, Mr. President.
0214	Philip Rucker	Philip Rucker from the Washington Post.
0215	Philip Rucker	You tweeted yesterday, "What good is NATO?"
0216	Philip Rucker	And you've talked about NATO as an alliance that benefits Europe, that defends and protects Europe.
0217	Philip Rucker	Do you see any value of NATO to the United States visavis Russia?
0218	Philip Rucker	Does it help protect the United States from Russia, in your view?
0219	Donald Trump	I think it's another very strong ally, as together it's much stronger than, obviously, individual countries.
0220	Donald Trump	I think it's  the way we have it now, I think it's a much  I think NATO got  you know what was happening with spending prior to my getting into office.
0221	Donald Trump	The numbers were going down.
0222	Donald Trump	Now the numbers have gone up like a rocket ship.
0223	Donald Trump	The numbers have gone up a lot, and they've gone up rapidly.
0224	Donald Trump	And they're now going up further.
0225	Donald Trump	So I think NATO is going to be very, very effective.
0226	Donald Trump	I'm very impressed with  and really know, and he's a friend mine  but Secretary General Stoltenberg has done a fantastic job and putting it all together.
0227	Donald Trump	And we were the ones that really  we gave him an extension of his contract, as you know.
0228	Donald Trump	I think he's done a really good job.
0229	Donald Trump	I think that when I was saying that I am very concerned with the pipeline, I don't like the pipeline.
0230	Donald Trump	And when I talk about NATO, I say, how do you have NATO?
0231	Donald Trump	And then you have somebody paying the people that you're protecting against.
0232	Donald Trump	But maybe we'll get along with the group that we're protecting against.
0233	Donald Trump	I think that's a real possibility.
0234	Donald Trump	As you know, I'm meeting with President Putin on Monday.
0235	Donald Trump	And I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much.
0236	Donald Trump	We want to find out about Syria.
0237	Donald Trump	We will, of course, ask your favorite question about meddling.
0238	Donald Trump	I will be asking that question again.
0239	Donald Trump	But we'll also be talking about other things.
0240	Donald Trump	We'll be talking about Ukraine.
0241	Donald Trump	Ukraine was here today, by the way.
0242	Donald Trump	And, you know, it was very interesting to hear what they had to say?
0243	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0244	Donald Trump	Excuse me?
0245	Question	What if he denies it?
0246	Donald Trump	Well, he may.
0247	Donald Trump	I mean, look, he may.
0248	Donald Trump	You know, what am I going to do?
0249	Donald Trump	He may deny it.
0250	Donald Trump	I mean, it's one of those things.
0251	Donald Trump	All I can do is say, "Did you" and "Don't do it again."
0252	Donald Trump	But he may deny it.
0253	Donald Trump	You'll be the first to know.
0254	Donald Trump	Okay?
0255	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead.
0256	Robert Wall	Mr. President, Robert Wall with the Wall Street Journal.
0257	Donald Trump	Yes.
0258	Donald Trump	Hi, Robert.
0259	Robert Wall	If the Germans and the Canadians and others don't come up to 2 percent, what is your fallback position?
0260	Robert Wall	How will you up the pressure to make them actually?
0261	Donald Trump	Well, they will.
0262	Donald Trump	They will.
0263	Donald Trump	I have no doubt about it.
0264	Donald Trump	They all made commitments.
0265	Donald Trump	And they will be up to 2 percent.
0266	Donald Trump	It will be over a period  a relatively short period of years.
0267	Donald Trump	Okay?
0268	Robert Wall	Please.
0269	Robert Wall	Thank you so much.
0270	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead. Georgian TV

0274	Donald Trump	Georgia more support from NATO?
0275	Question	And I wanted to ask about 
0276	Donald Trump	Georgia?
0277	Donald Trump	They were here today, representing.
0278	Question	Yes.
0279	Question	And will you talk about Georgia in a meeting with President Putin?
0280	Donald Trump	Well, they were here.
0281	Donald Trump	They made a very favorable impression.
0282	Donald Trump	And we listened to their plight.
0283	Donald Trump	It's a tough situation with Georgia.
0284	Donald Trump	But they made a very fair verbal impression in the room.
0285	Donald Trump	Okay?
0286	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.
0287	Donald Trump	Go.
0288	Donald Trump	Go.
0289	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0290	Question	She's already had one.
0291	Donald Trump	Yeah, you really did.
0292	Donald Trump	Come on.
0293	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0294	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0295	Question	Well, I had a question, as well.
0296	Question	But nonetheless, I'll ask, sir.
0297	Question	Will you recognize 
0298	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0299	Question	Will you recognize Russia's annex  will you recognize Crimea as part of Russia when you meet President 
0300	Donald Trump	Oh, that's an interesting question  because long before I got here, President Obama allowed that to happen.
0301	Donald Trump	That was on his watch, not on my watch.
0302	Donald Trump	You know, people like to say, "Oh, Crimea."
0303	Donald Trump	But the fact is, they built bridges to Crimea.
0304	Donald Trump	They just opened a big bridge that was started years ago.
0305	Donald Trump	They built, I think, a submarine port substantially added billions of dollars.
0306	Donald Trump	So that was on Barack Obama's watch.
0307	Donald Trump	That was not on Trump's watch.
0308	Donald Trump	Would I have allowed it to happen?
0309	Donald Trump	No, I would not have allowed it to happen.
0310	Donald Trump	But he did allow it to happen, so that was his determination.
0311	Donald Trump	What will happen with Crimea from this point on?
0312	Donald Trump	That I can't tell you.
0313	Donald Trump	But I'm not happy about Crimea.
0314	Donald Trump	But again, that was on Barack Obama's watch, not Trump's watch.
0315	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.
0316	Donald Trump	Sure.
0317	Jeff Mason	It's Jeff Mason from Reuters, Mr. President.
0318	Donald Trump	Sure.
0319	Donald Trump	I know, Jeff.
0320	Jeff Mason	Regarding your summit with President Putin, will you be raising arms control issues?
0321	Donald Trump	Yes.
0322	Question	Would you like to extend New START?
0323	Question	And will you raise concerns about violations of the INF Treaty?
0324	Donald Trump	Yes.
0325	Jeff Mason	And as a followup to the NATO meeting today, will you suggest to him, or would you consider stopping military exercises in the Baltic States, if that's something that he requests?
0326	Donald Trump	Well, perhaps we'll talk about that.
0327	Donald Trump	But I will say that we are going to be talking about those three issues and many more.
0328	Donald Trump	We'll be talking about it, Jeff.
0329	Donald Trump	Go ahead.

0337	Question	I would like to know if you are planning to guarantee the taxpayers that the new money that is flowing into NATO will be spent in the best possible way, especially the money coming from country that have several problem with the public finances.
0338	Donald Trump	Well, the money will be spent properly.
0339	Donald Trump	And one of the things that we have  we have many wealthy countries with us today, but we have some that aren't so wealthy.
0340	Donald Trump	And they did ask if they could buy the military equipment and could I help them out.
0341	Donald Trump	And we will help them out a little bit.
0342	Donald Trump	We're not going to finance it for them, but we'll make sure that they're able to get payments and various other things so they can buy.
0343	Donald Trump	Because the United States makes, by far, the best military equipment in the world.
0344	Donald Trump	The best jets, the best missiles, the best guns.
0345	Donald Trump	The best everything  we make, by far.
0346	Donald Trump	I mean, that's one thing  I guess I assumed it prior to taking office, but I really learned, since being President, our equipment is so much better than anybody else's equipment when you look at our companies  Lockheed and Boeing and Grumman.
0347	Donald Trump	The material  the equipment that we make is so far superior, everybody wants to buy our equipment.
0348	Donald Trump	In fact, it's the question, can they make it?
0349	Donald Trump	Because they are doing very well.
0350	Donald Trump	Can they make it for so many people?
0351	Donald Trump	So we are helping some of those countries get on line and buy the best equipment.
0352	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.
0353	Kristin Brown	Hi, I'm Kristin Brown with Fox News.
0354	Kristin Brown	On your upcoming summit with President Putin, did any of your allies here express any specific concerns or talk to you about any messages that they'd like you to take with you when you go to the summit?
0355	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0356	Donald Trump	Just the opposite of concern.
0357	Donald Trump	They actually  and they'll probably come out with a little bit of an edict  but they actually thanked me for meeting with President Putin.
0358	Donald Trump	I look forward to the meeting.
0359	Donald Trump	They thanked me.
0360	Donald Trump	They thought it was a great thing that I was doing it.
0361	Donald Trump	And they gave us our best wishes, or their best wishes.
0362	Donald Trump	Now, with that being said, we'll see that happens.
0363	Donald Trump	Just a loose meeting.
0364	Donald Trump	It's not going to be big schedule.
0365	Donald Trump	I don't think it should take a very long period of time.
0366	Donald Trump	And we'll see where it leads.
0367	Donald Trump	But it could lead to productive  something very productive.
0368	Donald Trump	And maybe it's not.
0369	Donald Trump	But I think meeting with people is great.
0370	Donald Trump	We had a great meeting with Chairman Kim.
0371	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you, Mike Pompeo did a fantastic job.
0372	Donald Trump	I might ask you to say a few words, Mike, while you're here.
0373	Donald Trump	Just one second.
0374	Donald Trump	Mike, go ahead.
0375	Mike Pompeo	Thank you, Mr. President.
0376	Mike Pompeo	So, I did.
0377	Mike Pompeo	I returned  I actually came straight from North Korea with a couple of stops here to Brussels.
0378	Mike Pompeo	We had a productive conversation.
0379	Mike Pompeo	There remains a great deal of work to do, but I think, most importantly, my counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, made a commitment consistent with what President Trump was able to achieve with Chairman Kim, which was They intend to denuclearize.
0380	Mike Pompeo	They're going to accomplish it.
0381	Mike Pompeo	And now the task is to get it implemented.
0382	Donald Trump	I think, just to finish on that, you know, it's so important.
0383	Donald Trump	That was an amazing  really, an amazing meeting, I though.
0384	Donald Trump	And I really think that we established a very good relationship.
0385	Donald Trump	We'll see where it all ends.
0386	Donald Trump	But there have been no missile tests.
0387	Donald Trump	There have been no research.
0388	Donald Trump	Where there has been  they have blown up a site I hear they're blowing up another site, missile site.
0389	Donald Trump	They've taken down all of the propaganda.
0390	Donald Trump	In fact, somebody said there's no more music playing at the border line.
0391	Donald Trump	You know, the music was going on for many years.
0392	Donald Trump	They said recently that, "Wow, there's no more of the heavy music and the propaganda."
0393	Donald Trump	They've done a lot of things.
0394	Donald Trump	And we got back our three hostages.
0395	Donald Trump	So it's a good process.
0396	Donald Trump	But the main thing is there have been no rocket launches.
0397	Donald Trump	There have been no missile tests.
0398	Donald Trump	There's been no nuclear tests, no explosions, no nothing, for almost nine months.
0399	Donald Trump	Okay.
0400	Donald Trump	Yeah, please.
0401	Ewen MacAskill	Ewen MacAskill from The Guardian.
0402	Ewen MacAskill	Your trip to the UK, there are lots of protests planned in London and elsewhere.
0403	Ewen MacAskill	How do you feel about that?
0404	Donald Trump	I think it's fine.
0405	Donald Trump	I mean, I think they like me a lot in the UK.
0406	Donald Trump	I think they agree with me on immigration.
0407	Donald Trump	I'm very strong on immigration.
0408	Donald Trump	I made a point today  I said, you've got to stop.
0409	Donald Trump	You're ruining your  you're going to have a lot of problems.
0410	Donald Trump	You see what's going on throughout the world with immigration.
0411	Donald Trump	I probably, at least partially, won an election because of immigration.
0412	Donald Trump	If you look at Italy  Giuseppe, who I got to know quite well over the last month and a half, he won his election because of strong immigration policies on Italy.
0413	Donald Trump	I think that a lot of the people in the UK  I think that's why Brexit happened.
0414	Donald Trump	Now, I don't know what's going on with the negotiation.
0415	Donald Trump	Who knows.
0416	Donald Trump	But  and I guess that's become a very interesting point of contention
0417	Donald Trump	I said I'm going to a few hotspots.
0418	Donald Trump	We have NATO, then we have the UK, and then we have Putin.
0419	Donald Trump	And I said, Putin may be the easiest of them all.
0420	Donald Trump	You never know.
0421	Donald Trump	But I'm going to a pretty hotspot right now, right, with a lot of resignations.
0422	Donald Trump	But I will say that immigration is a very important thing, and I told them today, the EU  the European Union  better be very careful, because immigration is taking over Europe, and they better be very, very careful.
0423	Donald Trump	And I said that loud and clear.
0424	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead. President Trump,
0425	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0426	Donald Trump	Romania.
0427	Question	What will you tell President Putin about this summit and about NATO?
0428	Donald Trump	Well, I think he's going to see about this summit  this has turned out to be a very successful summit.
0429	Donald Trump	This is  I think, really, that NATO is more put together right now, is more coordinated.
0430	Donald Trump	And I think there's a better spirit for NATO right now than perhaps they've ever had.
0431	Donald Trump	It's richer than it ever was.
0432	Donald Trump	The commitments are made at a higher level than they've ever been made.
0433	Donald Trump	And the money, it will be paid out faster  far faster.
0434	Donald Trump	You know, the 2 percent was a range, a goal.
0435	Donald Trump	It wasn't something that they were committed to.
0436	Donald Trump	Now it's a commitment.
0437	Donald Trump	There's a big difference  the 2 percent number.
0438	Donald Trump	And that's why so many people weren't reaching it or hitting it.
0439	Donald Trump	It was just sort of like this amorphous number out there.
0440	Donald Trump	Now it's a commitment, a real commitment.
0441	Donald Trump	I think he's going to see that there's great unity, great spirit, great esprit de corps.
0442	Donald Trump	And I think we're going to have a good meeting.
0443	Donald Trump	Regardless of that, I think we're going to have a good meeting.
0444	Donald Trump	But this was a fantastic two days.
0445	Donald Trump	This was a really fantastic  it all came together at the end.
0446	Donald Trump	And, yes, it was a little tough for a little while, but ultimately  you can ask anybody at that meeting  they're really liking what happened over the last two days.
0447	Donald Trump	There's a great, great spirit leaving that room.
0448	Donald Trump	Yes, sir.
0449	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0450	Donald Trump	Please.
0451	Jonathan Beale	Yeah.
0452	Jonathan Beale	Jonathan Beale from BBC.
0453	Jonathan Beale	I just wonder  you think you're going to get along with President Putin at that meeting.
0454	Jonathan Beale	Could you just tell us, why do you think that?
0455	Jonathan Beale	Is there something you admire about him?
0456	Jonathan Beale	And the second question, because you're just about to go to the UK, sir 
0457	Donald Trump	Well, he's a competitor.
0458	Donald Trump	He's been very nice to me the times I've met him.
0459	Donald Trump	I've been nice to him.
0460	Donald Trump	He's a competitor.
0461	Donald Trump	You know, somebody was saying, "Is he an enemy?"
0462	Donald Trump	No, he's not my enemy.
0463	Donald Trump	Is he a friend?
0464	Donald Trump	No, I don't know him well enough.
0465	Donald Trump	But the couple of times that I've gotten to meet him, we got along very well.
0466	Donald Trump	You saw that.
0467	Donald Trump	I hope we get along well.
0468	Donald Trump	I think we get along well.
0469	Donald Trump	But ultimately, he's a competitor.
0470	Donald Trump	He's representing Russia.
0471	Donald Trump	I'm representing the United States.
0472	Donald Trump	So in a sense, we're competitors.
0473	Donald Trump	Not a question of friend or enemy.
0474	Donald Trump	He's not my enemy.
0475	Donald Trump	And hopefully, someday, maybe he'll be a friend.
0476	Donald Trump	It could happen.
0477	Donald Trump	But I  I just don't know him very well.
0478	Donald Trump	I've met him a couple of times.
0479	Donald Trump	And when I did meet him, most of you people were there.
0480	Donald Trump	Yes.
0481	Jonathan Beale	And Brexit  sorry, sir, because you are going to the UK.
0482	Jonathan Beale	What will be your message on Brexit?
0483	Donald Trump	Well, Brexit is a  you know, I've been reading a lot about Brexit over the last couple of days, and it seems to be turning a little bit differently where they're getting at least partially involved back with the European Union.
0484	Donald Trump	I have no message.
0485	Donald Trump	It's not for me to say.
0486	Donald Trump	I own a lot of property there.
0487	Donald Trump	I'm going to Scotland while I wait for the meeting.
0488	Donald Trump	I have Turnberry in Scotland, which is a magical place  one of my favorite places.
0489	Donald Trump	I'm going there for two days while I wait for the Monday meeting.
0490	Donald Trump	But it's not for me to say what they should be doing in the UK.
0491	Donald Trump	I have great friendships.
0492	Donald Trump	My mother was born in Scotland.
0493	Donald Trump	I have great friendships over there.
0494	Donald Trump	We have a wonderful ambassador  Woody Johnson.
0495	Donald Trump	And he's doing  by the way, Woody is doing a great job.
0496	Donald Trump	But it's not for me to say.
0497	Donald Trump	I'd like to see him be able to work it so it could go quickly, whatever they work out.
0498	Question	Hard Brexit?
0499	Donald Trump	Is it heartbreaking?
0500	Question	Hard Brexit.
0501	Donald Trump	Oh, hard Brexit.
0502	Donald Trump	I see.
0503	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0504	Donald Trump	I thought you said it was heartbreaking.
0505	Donald Trump	I said, that might be going a little bit too far, right?
0506	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0507	Donald Trump	Heartbreak.
0508	Donald Trump	Is it heartbreaking?
0509	Donald Trump	A lot of things are heartbreaking.
0510	Donald Trump	No, I would say that Brexit is Brexit.
0511	Donald Trump	It's not like  I guess we'll use the term "hard Brexit."
0512	Donald Trump	I assume that's what you mean.
0513	Donald Trump	The people voted to break it up, so I would imagine that's what they'll do.
0514	Donald Trump	But maybe they're taking a little bit of a different route.
0515	Donald Trump	So I don't know if that's what they voted for.
0516	Donald Trump	I just want the people to be happy.
0517	Donald Trump	They're great people.
0518	Donald Trump	And I do think I have  I'm sure there will be protests, because there are always protests.
0519	Donald Trump	But I think  there were protests the night of the election, both ways.
0520	Donald Trump	But in the end, we got 206 electoral  306 electoral votes.
0521	Donald Trump	And one state said  you know, it was interesting, one of the states we won, Wisconsin  I didn't even realize this until fairly recently  that was the one state Ronald Reagan didn't win when he ran the board his second time.
0522	Donald Trump	He didn't win Wisconsin, and we won Wisconsin.
0523	Donald Trump	So, you know, we had a great night.
0524	Donald Trump	Protests?
0525	Donald Trump	There might be protests.
0526	Donald Trump	But I believe that the people in the UK  Scotland, Ireland.
0527	Donald Trump	As you know, I have property in Ireland I have property all over.
0528	Donald Trump	I think that those people, they like me a lot, and they agree with me on immigration.
0529	Donald Trump	And I think that's why you have Brexit in the first place, because of immigration.
0530	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.
0531	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.

0535	Question	And don't you think that your hard diplomacy  that you are playing to the same goal that Putin, with your hard diplomacy towards EU and NATO?
0536	Donald Trump	Well, I can't tell you what would be the ultimate.
0537	Donald Trump	What would be the ultimate?
0538	Donald Trump	Well, let's see No more nuclear weapons anywhere in the world would be the ultimate, okay?
0539	Donald Trump	No more wars, no more problems, no more conflict.
0540	Donald Trump	Let's find a cure to every disease known to mankind, or womankind.
0541	Donald Trump	That would be my ultimate, okay?

0555	Question	And when the war is going to end in Afghanistan?
0556	Question	Because people are fed up now and they want to know.
0557	Donald Trump	I agree with that.
0558	Donald Trump	I very much agree.
0559	Donald Trump	It's been going on for a long time.
0560	Donald Trump	We've made a lot of progress, but it's been going on for a long time.
0561	Donald Trump	We've made a lot of progress in Afghanistan, I will say.
0562	Donald Trump	Yes, your President is here right now.
0563	Donald Trump	In fact, he's in the room.
0564	Donald Trump	When I'm finished with this, I'm going right back into that room.

0588	Question	You said Putin isn't an enemy, isn't a friend he's just a competitor.
0589	Donald Trump	He's a competitor.
0590	Question	Do you consider him as a security threat for Europe or to the U.S.?
0591	Question	Thank you.
0592	Donald Trump	Hey, I don't want him to be.
0593	Donald Trump	And that's, I guess, why we have NATO, and that's why we have a United States that just had the largest military budget ever  $700 billion approved $716 billion next year.
0594	Donald Trump	No, I hope that we'll be able to get along.
0595	Donald Trump	I've said from day one, whether it's China or Russia  you know, we're working on trade with China right now, and I don't say that's an easy situation, because that's been years of abuse of the United States by presidents, frankly, that allowed that to happen.
0596	Donald Trump	So I've taken over a lot of bad hands, and I'm fixing each one of them and I'm fixing them well.
0597	Donald Trump	But China is going to be, I think, very successfully, ultimately, taken care of.
0598	Donald Trump	I have a great respect for their President, as you know  President Xi.
0599	Donald Trump	I spent two days there.
0600	Donald Trump	It was among the most magical two days I've ever lived.
0601	Donald Trump	And I think we're going to end up doing something very good with China.
0602	Donald Trump	Right now, we're in a pretty nasty trade battle, but I think ultimately that will work out.
0603	Donald Trump	I really think we have a big advantage.
0604	Donald Trump	You know, we've picked up $8 trillion in value, in worth, since I became President.
0605	Donald Trump	And we're close to two times the size of China.
0606	Donald Trump	A lot of people don't know that.
0607	Donald Trump	And, you know, we're going to negotiate a fair deal, if that's possible.
0608	Donald Trump	Okay.

0616	Jamal Mousavi	But they are threatening to 
0617	Donald Trump	By the way, they're treating us with much more respect right now than they did in the past.
0618	Donald Trump	And I think  I know they're having a lot of problems and their economy is collapsing.
0619	Donald Trump	But I will tell you this At a certain point, they're going to call me and they're going to say, "Let's make a deal," and we'll make a deal.
0620	Donald Trump	But they are  they're feeling a lot of pain right now.

0639	Alla Shali	And you want to talk about Syria with President Putin.
0640	Alla Shali	Can I have any information about Quds in Syria?
0641	Alla Shali	Thank you very much.
0642	Donald Trump	So I hope we get along well with Iraq.
0643	Donald Trump	We've certainly spent a great fortune in Iraq.
0644	Donald Trump	And many, many lives  thousands and hundreds of thousands of lives, if you think on both sides, which I always think about both sides, not just our side.
0645	Donald Trump	And they had an election, and I hope we're going to be able to get along, and we'll see how that goes.
0646	Donald Trump	We've already been talking to the people that won the election.
0647	Donald Trump	I was not in favor of that war.
0648	Donald Trump	I was very much against that war.
0649	Donald Trump	I never thought it was a good thing.
0650	Donald Trump	But that's another deck of cards that I inherited, and we'll do the best we can with it.
0651	Donald Trump	I think the election was pretty conclusive.
0652	Donald Trump	And again, we've spoken to them.

0672	Donald Trump	And we want peace.
0673	Donald Trump	We want peace for Africa.
0674	Donald Trump	We want peace all over the world.
0675	Donald Trump	That's my numberone goal peace all over the world.
0676	Donald Trump	And we're building up a tremendous military, because I really believe, through strength, you get peace.
0677	Donald Trump	But we're going to have a military like we've never had before.
0678	Donald Trump	We've given out orders for the best fighter jets in the world, the best ships, the best everything.
0679	Donald Trump	But hopefully we'll never have to use them.
