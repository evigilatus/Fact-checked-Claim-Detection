Juliani is rightly proud of the significant decrease in crime rates during his tenure as mayor. Raw percentages are eye-browing, but they also reflect a trend that can be seen at the national level and in cities throughout the country. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, in this statement, Giuliani simply tried to say a lot. His assertion that the national decline in crime would be \"a little small\" if not for improvements in New York isn't true. In the period 1993-2001 -- the time frame used by Juliani's crime statistics campaign -- the number of violent crimes across the country decreased by about 25 per cent. If you analyse the crimes that occurred in New York during the same period, the drop across the country is still 23 percent. The difference in the decrease in property offences could have been smaller.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00317"}
