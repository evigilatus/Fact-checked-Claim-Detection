So it\u2019s not surprising that the probe has played a prominent role in campaign literature and TV ads of the candidates promising to deliver a more honest, open government to Cuyahoga County residents.\n\nBut the scandal also has become a useful weapon for those seeking state offices, including Republicans who want to see State Sen. and former Ohio House Speaker Jon Husted become the next Secretary of State.\n\nThe Ohio Republican Party is distributing a piece of campaign literature for Husted that juxtaposes the now iconic photo of federal agents leading Dimora from his home in chains last month with an unflattering image of Husted\u2019s Democratic opponent, Maryellen O\u2019Shaughnessy.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee\n\n\nstated on September 21, 2010 in an election ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Ganley has \"two F's from the Better Business Bureau\" and \"over 160 complaints in just three years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Feran \u2022 October 21, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven without words, the ad is playing the guilt-by-association game. (Democrats mastered the game four years ago, tying every Republican they could to the now infamous coin dealer and Republican fund-raiser Tom Noe, who ended up behind bars for theft and corruption charges.)\n\nThe ORP literature claims O\u2019Shaughnessy \"accepted campaign cash from indicted politician Jimmy Dimora.\"\n\nThat charge could certainly resonate with voters, especially in Northeast Ohio, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to test its truthfulness.\n\nDimora\u2019s campaign in fact did give money - $100 - to O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s campaign. And Dimora has been indicted on 23 federal charges.\u00a0\n\nHowever the two facts don\u2019t fit together as neatly in reality as they do on the flier.\u00a0\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy received the donation on June 25, 2008, a month before the federal investigation became public and agents raided Dimora\u2019s home and office. At the time, O\u2019Shaughnessy was not a candidate for secretary of state, but was running for her current job, Franklin County clerk of courts.\n\nBy using the term \"indicted politician,\" the ad implies that O\u2019Shaughnessy accepted money from Dimora after he was indicted. Dimora, who maintains his innocence, wasn\u2019t indicted until September 2010. And it's worth noting again, the federal investigation was not public when the donation was made.\n\nThe GOP flier restates the claim with more dramatic flare on the back. \"O\u2019Shaughnessy took campaign cash from corrupt politician Jimmy Dimora,\" a point illustrated by a close up of a thick stack of $100 bills passing between two hands.\u00a0\n\nHusted, though not directly responsible for distributing the advertisement, supports its messaging and believes the ad is fair description of the facts.\n\nThe ORP also stands by the claim argues that even after O\u2019Shaughnessy learned of the indictments, she never returned the money or donated an equal amount to charity as other Democrats in a similar predicament have done. (O\u2019Shaughnessy argues her campaign account is closed and therefore can\u2019t do anything. But that doesn\u2019t preclude her from donating an equal amount from her current campaign to charity.)\n\nTurning back to the claim at hand, O\u2019Shaughnessy did accept a campaign contribution from Dimora. And Dimora has been indicted in a federal corruption probe. Separately those are correct.\n\nBut the flier\u2019s combines the two facts to make the underlying suggestion that O\u2019Shaughnessy took the money from a politician under federal indicted at the time of the contribution. That underlying message qualifies the claim for a rating of False.\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14187"}
