They're unhappy with her support of abortion rights, but a recent blog posting made a surprising allegation: That she said motherhood was \"involuntary servitude.\"\n\n\nWe wondered if she was really was so impolitic as to attack motherhood. And if so, does she have it in for apple pie as well?\n\n\nThe allegation came from the Web site of the House Republican Conference:\n\n\n\"At least 45 House Republicans have co-signed a letter to President Barack Obama in opposition to his nomination of Dawn Johnson [sic] for the head of the Office of Legal Counsel,\" the site says in a\n\nblog post\n\n. The post continued: \"Her brazen pro-abortion stances [include] a Supreme Court amicus brief where she called motherhood 'involuntary servitude.'\"\n\n\nThe Republicans are referring to a 1989 brief in\n\nWebster vs. Reproductive Health Services,\n\na case that tested whether states could prohibit abortions in public health institutions. Johnsen was then legal director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, one of 77 organizations to sign the brief.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 23, part of the brief that Johnsen said in a Senate hearing that she wrote, said the following: \"While a woman might choose to bear children gladly and voluntarily, statutes that curtail her abortion choice are disturbingly suggestive of involuntary servitude, prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment, in that forced pregnancy requires a woman to provide continuous physical service to the fetus in order to further the state's asserted interest. Indeed, the actual process of delivery demands work of the most intense and physical kind: labor of 12 or more grueling hours of contractions is not uncommon.\"\n\n\nSo Johnsen compared \"forced pregnancy\" \u2014 not motherhood \u2014 to involuntary servitude.\n\n\nAfter we asked the Republican Conference about the claim, staffer Ericka Andersen acknowledged it was wrong. \"You are correct that the post was written inaccurately,\" she told us in an e-mail. She corrected the post to say Johnsen \"equated forced pregnancy with 'involuntary servitude.'\"\n\n\nKudos to the conference for acknowledging the error. But we still find the original claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15795"}
