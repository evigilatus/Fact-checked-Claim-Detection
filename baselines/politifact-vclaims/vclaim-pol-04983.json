He used his opening remarks to criticize the race\u2019s frontrunner, Democratic California Attorney General Kamala Harris.\n\"The PPIC (Public Policy Institute of California) recently reported that Kamala is failing to keep us safe,\" Sundheim said May 10, 2016. \"There is a 34 percent increase in violent crime in the state of California. \u2026 And that\u2019s just within the last year.\"\nThe PPIC, a nonpartisan think tank, reported no such thing.\nWhat the PPIC said\nThe PPIC report cited by Sundheim doesn\u2019t include final statewide violent crime data for 2015. It has preliminary statistics for January to June 2015 for 66 California cities covering about half of the state\u2019s population.\nBrandon Martin, the co-author of the report and a research associate at the policy institute, told PolitiFact California that statewide crime statistics for 2015 \u00a0won\u2019t be available until this summer.\nMoreoever, Sundheim misstated the preliminary data that the PPIC did have.\nThe authors of the report said 34 of the 66 California cities saw a double-digit percentage increase in violent crimes.\nThey never claimed that the state, or even the sample of cities, saw a 34 percent increase in violent crime.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have not seen any data showing a 34 percent increase in crime in California in 2015.
