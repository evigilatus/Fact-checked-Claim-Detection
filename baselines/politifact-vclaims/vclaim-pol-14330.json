Russ Feingold faked his TV ad", "text": "In a new TV ad, U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold goes back in history, reviving images from his successful 1992 campaign when he painted promises on his garage door in Middleton. Facing a tough re-election battle, the Wisconsin Democrat tells voters he owns the same house and is still the small-town fella they elected 18 years ago -- except that today he posts promises on a website instead of his garage.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly what you would call an attack ad. But it was enough to open the door for an attack by WISN-AM talk radio host Mark Belling.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to make an accusation here, and I am very confident that I am correct in my accusation,\" Belling said in the first hour of his Sept. 28, 2010 program. \"That ad is a fake. That ad is a fake. Feingold is not standing in front of his house in this new ad. They faked it.\"\n\nBelling said he checked out the ad himself and cited an expert source he said he could not identify.\n\n\"Ninety minutes of my life today was spent frame-by-framing this through the Internet to find the tipoffs that have convinced me the ad is fake,\" he told his listeners. \"\u2026My contention is Russ is standing in the studio.\"\n\nOn his website, Belling posted a link to the ad with this headline: \"This Feingold Ad Is A Fake: He\u2019s Not Standing In Front of His House.\"\n\nWhile our primary focus at PolitiFact Wisconsin is fact-checking the promises, claims and accusations made by elected officials and candidates, we will also examine the words of other voices who shape the political discourse.\n\nThis was a strong accusation: Did a U.S. Senate candidate aiming to show off his roots back home fake the scene from a far-off TV studio?\n\nBelling wasn\u2019t the only person to suggest it.\n\nA political blog affiliated with the conservative National Review said it appeared that Feingold had filmed his portion of the commercial elsewhere, in front of a \"green screen,\" and then was superimposed in front of the Middleton house. This note was picked up by National Public Radio in a weekly game show heard by some 3 million people.\n\nBoth the blog and NPR withdrew their suggestions after the Feingold campaign complained it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nWe asked Belling for his evidence.\n\n\"I have none,\" he said in an e-mail to PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"It\u2019s an accusation. They can deny it and if they're right, I'll admit it.\n\n\"But it's very fishy.\"\n\nHe went on to highlight his suspicions, including: \"The bushes throw off a shadow; Feingold doesn\u2019t\"; and \"His wave to the house looks fake. Why wave to a house when you\u2019re in front of it.\" Also, the light is shining from the left, but Feingold\u2019s left side \"doesn\u2019t seem lit,\u2019\u2019 Belling wrote.\n\nAnd the feet: \"Why do you not see Russ's feet? \u00a0It's much harder to make it appear he's\nstanding on something than in front of it.\"\n\nBelling declined to name his source, other than to say he was involved in video production and shared his suspicions.\n\n\"I have no proof,\u2019\u2019 Belling said. \"I'm making an accusation that it's faked, and they can confirm or deny it.\"\n\nSo, we asked Feingold. \u00a0Was he standing in his driveway when the ad was shot?\n\n\"I\u2019m trying not to laugh,\" Feingold said. \"Yes.\"\n\nAfter spending the night at \u00a0his Middleton house, Feingold said, he attended the dedication of a war memorial in Sauk Prairie on Aug. 28 while the production crew set up in the driveway. Then he returned home to shoot the commercial.\n\nHis campaign provided a still photo shot during the filming that shows Feingold in front of the house with a crew member identified as Rob Wernette, a freelance grip from Milwaukee.\n\nAn employee for the WisPolitics.com website also saw the ad being filmed, with Feingold standing in his driveway. \u00a0Jeff Mayers, president of WisPolitics, said one of his employees saw Feingold filming the ad in front of his home and the employee confirmed it when contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nFeingold said plenty of folks passed by the house during the two-hour filming, some beeping and giving him a thumbs up.\n\nFeingold complained that he has received a lot of \"cheap shots,\u2019\u2019 but that \"this is the dumbest one of all time.\u2019\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re \u00a0not aware of any ranking of cheap shots, so we won\u2019t weigh in on that.\n\nAs for Belling\u2019s accusation, the veteran talk show host tried to turn Feingold\u2019s own ad against him, to suggest he\u2019s so out of touch with state voters that he was even out of state when the ad was filmed. He said he based his assertion on his own review of the photography and on one unnamed source, who had no knowledge of how the shoot was conducted but who thought it looked fishy. As for Belling\u2019s proof, we\u2019ll use his own words to describe it: \"I have none.\"\n\nAnd we\u2019ll add three words of our own: Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: On Sept. 30, 2010, Belling changed his position and said the Feingold ad was not faked).", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14330"}
