Obama had planned for all troops to be out of Afghanistan by Dec. 31, 2014 -- marking more than 13 years of military there -- though a draft accord leaves as many as 10,000 American troops in Afghanistan indefinitely.\nThat\u2019s longer than the major United States interventions in World War I and World War II. It\u2019s also longer than the conflict in Korea, and both wars in Iraq.\nThe second Iraq war lasted for more than eight years. It began with a U.S.-led military coalition entering the country on March 20, 2003, aimed at finding Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. Obama pulled out the last U.S. troops by the end of December 2011.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe closest major conflict to Afghanistan in terms of length is Vietnam. The start date of the Vietnam war is somewhat fuzzy because it escalated slowly with the Eisenhower administration establishing a military presence in South Vietnam in the 1950s. However, most say the war started with the Tonkin Gulf resolution on Aug. 7, 1964, and ended either in 1973 or 1975 -- after about 10 \u00bd years.\nSo while Gibbs is on solid ground, there are a couple of things worth noting.\nGibbs\u2019 measure excludes broader \"wars.\" To reach the conclusion that Afghanistan is the longest foreign war in U.S. history, you need to exclude the 46-year-old Cold War and the presence of military forces in South Korea decades after the on-the-ground battle concluded. University of North Carolina historian Richard H. Kohn said in a 2010 interview that some might consider the conflict in Afghanistan part of the \"war on terror.\" But by that logic, the wars in Korea and Vietnam also could be considered part of the Cold War.\nThe \"Banana Wars\" in Latin America in the early 20th century lasted longer but didn\u2019t always include active fighting. These wars were not declared wars but \"relatively quick-in-and-out interventions which kept happening over and over,\" said Max Boot, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations and author of The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power.\nThe goal was to preserve U.S. economic, political and strategic interests in various Caribbean-area countries, including Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Panama, said Alan McPherson, a University of Oklahoma professor and author of The Invaded: How Latin Americans and Their Allies Fought and Ended U.S. Occupations.\nThe longest consistent military occupation was in politically unstable Haiti from 1915 to 1934. That does not translate to 19 years of straight fighting, though there were two short periods of wars that were \"nowhere near the fighting we\u2019ve had in Afghanistan,\" McPherson said. The U.S. military presence mainly ran the government. There were 2,000-3,000 marines in Haiti at the height of the U.S. occupation, McPherson said.\nThere were other significant informal wars around this time, including an eight-year presence in the Dominican Republic that saw the U.S. military taking over the government and dissolving the country\u2019s parliament, as well as fighting a six-year rebellion in Nicaragua led by August Cesar Sandino.\nOur ruling\nGibbs said, \"We have been in Afghanistan longer now than we have been in any foreign land conducting a war in our nation\u2019s history.\"\nPeople can make different interpretations as to what constitutes a war. We take no issue with Gibbs\u2019 interpretation but acknowledge that people might see the Banana Wars as the longest U.S. conflict on foreign soil. Gibbs is accurate, but his statement requires some additional context. We rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08415"}
