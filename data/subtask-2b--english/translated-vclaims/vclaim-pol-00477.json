On the day the New York State Senate passed the Green Light and Goff Bill. It was signed by Andrew Como, Cairns, whose office oversees the Cars Department in Irie County, who claimed that the law provides undocumented migrants with \"protection not to be received by United States citizens.\" When Cairns arrived by telephone, he said that he had been referring to a section of the new law that required car commissioners to give notice to the individual within three days in the event that an immigration enforcement agency requested information about that individual. Drivers whose information is requested by other law enforcement agencies do not receive a three-day notice. \"There's a different standard,\" he said. \"This is protection I don't have right now.\" The decision of New York legislators to grant driving licences to undocumented migrants has provoked a strong reaction from people opposed to this idea. So we decided to look into Kearns' claim. The Green Light Act allows undocumented migrants to obtain standard (non-commercial) driving licences. It prevents car management personnel from handing over information to immigration law enforcement agencies without a court order or court order. If the Car Management Department receives a court order or order, the employees order the delivery of records or information concerning the driver to the Immigration Authority, the Car Management Commissioners must notify the driver, regardless of the driver &apos; s immigration status, of the application within three days. Kerns alleges that this notification is a special protection for undocumented drivers. While this provision may alert undocumented drivers to the fact that immigration, customs or customs and border protection officials are asking for them, one of the experts with whom we spoke suggested that it could help everyone. There's a history of ICE that targets the wrong U.S. citizens to deport them, and Kendra Sena, Senior Advocate at the State Law Center at the Albanian Law School, said. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" In 2008, a man born in North Carolina, without Mexican heritage, was wrongfully deported to Mexico, and his case was finally resolved with the Federal Government. In 2013, the University of Syracuse published a study showing that in the past four years the Institute has issued a notice of arrest of 834 American citizens and 28,489 permanent residents. In the last two years, the Institute &apos; s efforts to detain naturalized American citizens born in the United States have been at the headlines, including the case of an American Marine born in Michigan. Sina said that the notification provision applied in the context of migration but not in other contexts because the consequences of migration procedures might be very severe. The provision giving notice to drivers who have drawn the attention of immigration law enforcement applies to each driver, regardless of their immigration status, as Fabi\u00e1n Levy, the press secretary of the State Prosecutor &apos; s Office, said. Under the law, the response of the Ministry of Defence to agencies requesting information on the basis of the driver &apos; s immigration status remains unchanged, as stated by Nicole Hallett, Director of the Community Justice Clinic at Buffalo University, Law School. \"There is no scenario in which an agency makes two requests for information, one concerning a citizen and the other concerning an undocumented immigrant, and allows him to comply with the first rather than the last request.\" :: Car management is either prohibited from complying with either order or allowed to comply with both, depending on the identity of the agency Our referee (Kairns) said undocumented migrants are protected under the Green Light Act, which is not granted to United States citizens. Under the Act, if an immigration law enforcement agency obtains a court order or a court order to obtain information about a driver, the Car Department must notify the driver within three days. This notification occurs regardless of whether the driver is lawfully present in the country. While this provision may assist undocumented drivers more than documented drivers, all drivers are treated equally under this provision. We also appreciate the horns' favors.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00477"}
