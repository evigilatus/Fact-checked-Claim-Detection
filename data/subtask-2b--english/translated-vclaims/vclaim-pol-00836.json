Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021 in The View in November 2016, Ford said: \"I was asked to wear it a few years ago and refused.\" When one of the hosts asks why, he says it's not necessarily his \"image.\" Although he says he is democratic, he makes it clear that he does not believe that Hillary Clinton should have worn his clothes if she had won the presidency, because it is expensive. A few months later, he told El that he believed that the president or First Lady should wear \"dresses at a price point that most Americans can access, and wear clothes made in America.\" But Ford denied that he invited Trump as a welcome escort.

I never said that Melania was an escort. I told Ford \"WWD.\" \"I didn't say anything offensive about Melania. I won't say anything offensive.
