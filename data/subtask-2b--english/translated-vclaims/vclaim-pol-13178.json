Doubts about the ability of President Obama and the Republics of the House of Representatives to do so by reconciling their plans to reduce the deficit led the Standard and Borz rating agency to reduce its view of the United States from \"stable\" to \"negative.\" S&P warned that the United States might lose its aspiring position as the world &apos; s safer economy if legislators did not agree to bring spending into line with revenues. The World Programme Plan, approved by the Council, would reduce taxes on companies and the richest Americans and derive most of their savings from the reduction of federal health-care programmes. The Obama Plan would raise taxes on the richest Americans and reduce military and local spending. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Bohner, responded by declaring tax increases \"uninitial.\" \"We don't have a deficit because the taxes on Americans are too small, and we have a deficit because Washington spends too much,\" said the Republican of West Chester in Southwest Ohio. From the other side of the State and from the political spectrum, he also said that he was not satisfied with the President &apos; s plan. But the Democrat in Cleveland said he preferred Obama's intention to end the so-called Bush tax cuts for the rich. Tax cuts, he said, \"Help create a big part of the deficit.\" Bohanner's comment on excessive spending was a statement of opinion. Polyte Fact Ohio cannot be estimated. But we can consider Kusini\u0107 &apos; s claim of tax cuts, which run counter to assertions that tax cuts pay for themselves. The tax cuts in Bush refer to two pieces of legislation - the Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation Act 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Conciliation Act 2003 - enacted by President George W. Bush and written to expire at the end of 2010. It was extended for two years in December. The non-partisan congressional research department examined it in \"Bosh tax cuts and the economy,\" a report issued last December, and in a previous study on budget deficits and key legislation. In 2001, CSR stated that the Budget Office of Congress expected a gradual increase in federal budget surpluses for the next decade. Tax cuts helped to change expectations \"dramatically,\" and in 2002 the budget recorded a deficit for the first time since 1997. \"Bosch's tax cuts, with a $10 trillion card, contributed to this shift from budget surpluses to deficits,\" said CRS. Other contributors include the 2001 recession, increased defence spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the usefulness of prescription drugs. But tax cuts \"born the largest 10-year increases in budget deficits,\" said CRS. The budget office of the non-partisan Congress and the Joint Tax Commission estimates that the total cost of tax cuts (including the 2004 Working Families Tax Exemption Act) exceeds the amount allocated to the Ministry of Defence for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"This means that even with spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the federal budget would have been in surplus in 2007 if tax cuts had not been enacted or their costs compensated,\" said the 2008 analysis from the left-wing position of budget and policy priorities. In the past year, the Organization had projected a reduction in the deficit if tax cuts ended, and it would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years to extend it all permanently and increase the deficit. Polyte Fact has already studied assurances that tax cuts increase revenue by stimulating economic growth. We found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Tax Commission and the White House Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to lower revenues than they would otherwise have been - even if they stimulated some economic growth. \"There is no clear relationship between taxes and economic growth,\" said Bob Williams of the Center for Non-Party Tax Policy. \"Many factors complicate the picture to draw clear conclusions on the relationship between taxes and growth.\" Our colleagues in Factcheck.org reached a similar conclusion. In addition, the Budget Office of Congress reported in March, \"taking into account the size of the economy, federal revenues are currently at their lowest level in 60 years.\" \"There is no real conflict between economists that broad-based federal income tax cuts reduce revenue (except when tax rates are much higher than they are now), said Alan D. Fyard of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"The opportunity is less than it would be without Bush's tax cuts - liberal economists and conservatives agree on this matter.\" Discussions will continue on the effectiveness of tax cuts in stimulating growth. We're not gonna get him in. However, the analysis supports Kusini\u0107 in saying that Bush cut \"helped create a large part of the deficit.\" We're assessing his statement as correct.
