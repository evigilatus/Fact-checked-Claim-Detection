But the number is misleading, since it compares the high point under Obama with the federal prison count almost two years into Trump\u2019s presidency.\nThe same Bureau of Justice Statistics data shows that there were 201,280 prisoners in federal custody on Dec. 31, 2008, nearly one month before Obama\u2019s inauguration. There were 189,192 by the same day in 2016, with less than a month left in Obama\u2019s second term.\nThat\u2019s a decline of about 12,000 prisoners, not 38,000.\nThe number doesn\u2019t count prisoners released\nThe second issue with Biden\u2019s claim is the term \"released.\"\u00a0\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics data measures the federal prison population and can be used to show population changes from year to year. It doesn\u2019t track prisoners who were released.\n\"Released is not the right word here,\" said Kara Gotsch, director of strategic initiatives at the Sentencing Project. \"What we\u2019re talking about is a decline in the population.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal prison population changes all the time, Gotsch said. It drops when prisoners finish their sentences or die, for example, and it rises when new prisoners come in. The population has contracted considerably during the coronavirus pandemic, Gotsch said, as start dates for some prisoners\u2019 sentences are getting deferred for safety reasons.\nBiden framed his point more accurately earlier in the debate. \"The federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration,\" he said.\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons does keep tallies of the tens of thousands of federal inmates released each year. But the release data doesn\u2019t say much about the Obama administration\u2019s criminal justice reform efforts, which is the point Biden was trying to make.\u00a0\n\"People get released every day just because their sentence ends,\" Gotsch said.\nThe Obama administration helped drive the decline\nThat said, Gotsch told PolitiFact that policies implemented by the Obama administration \u2014 along with two changes made during Obama\u2019s tenure by the independent, bipartisan U.S. Sentencing Commission \u2014 did help drive a decline in the federal prison population.\nThe Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, for example, dramatically reduced a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission approved the retroactive application of some of the new sentencing guidelines.\u00a0\nAccording to a U.S. Sentencing Commission report, 7,748 crack-cocaine offenders received retroactive reductions to their prison sentences under that change.\u00a0\nThe U.S. Sentencing Commission also voted in 2014 to reduce drug sentencing guidelines by two offense levels and apply the change retroactively. That change has resulted in 31,763 drug offenders getting retroactive sentence reductions as of June, according to the commission.\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder also instituted a \"Smart on Crime Initiative\" that Gotsch said led to fewer federal drug prosecutions. A separate Justice Department initiative urged qualified federal inmates to seek sentence commutations. Obama commuted the sentences of 1,696 people through that program, the U.S. Sentencing Commission found.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nBiden said that as part of the Obama administration\u2019s criminal justice reforms, \"38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison.\"\nThe 38,000 figure is cherry-picked. It represents the change in the federal prison population from its peak at the end of 2012 to the end of 2018, nearly two years into Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0\nThe federal prison population did shrink under Obama for the first time in decades, but the true decline from the start to the end of Obama\u2019s presidency was about 12,000 prisoners.\nThe 38,000 figure also describes a reduction in the federal prison population \u2014 which can happen for a myriad of reasons \u2014 rather than the number of federal inmates who were released under or because of the Obama administration\u2019s policies.\nWe rate Biden\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18763"}
