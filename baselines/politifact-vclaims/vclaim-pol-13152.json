We need to make sure that these threats do not continue to grow and do not continue to infiltrate our state and our government.\"\n\nWe wondered if Hasner was right, has a Florida judge announced that his decision was going to be based on Islamic Law?\n\nWe found a March 22, 2011, article by the St. Petersburg Times headlined \"Judge Orders Use of 'Sharia' in Suit.\" We will explain the case first before we get into Hasner's comment.\n\nThe case\n\nIn November 2010, Hillsborough Circuit Court Judge Richard A. Nielsen took up a lawsuit filed against the Islamic Education Center of Tampa by former trustees.\n\nIn dispute were issues related to the corporate governance of the IEC, a learning and community center for Muslims in the Tampa Bay area. In 2002, the center changed its bylaws to eliminate a provision allowing trustees to serve for life, according to a St. Petersburg Times article.\n\nThe deposed trustees sued individual mosque leaders in 2008, arguing that they were unfairly removed. In January 2009, Ghulam Hurr Shabbiri, an Islamic scholar from Houston, came to speak at the IEC at the center\u2019s invitation.\n\nIn speaking to some of those involved in the lawsuit, the scholar (dubbed an A\u2019lim in Islamic culture) agreed to arbitrate the dispute matter so long as both sides agreed to drop the lawsuit and acknowledge his decision as binding.\n\nOn Dec. 28, 2009, the A\u2019lim ruled that the trustees were removed improperly, according to the St. Petersburg Times. But the center countered that his ruling was not binding because only one of the four new trustees signed the agreement to enter into arbitration.\n\nTo sort out the mess, enter Nielsen, who oversees complex business litigation for the 13th Circuit Court of Florida in Hillsborough County. At stake in this leadership tussle is who controls $2.2 million the center received from the state, after the state used some of the center\u2019s land for a road project.\n\nOn March 3, 2011, Nielsen, issued an order in the case in which he wrote: \"The case will proceed under Ecclesiastical Islamic Law.\"\n\nHe wrote: \"Under Ecclesiastical Islamic Law, pursuant to the Qur\u2019an brothers should try to resolve a dispute amongst themselves. When the brothers are unable to do so, they can agree to present the dispute to the greater community of brothers within the mosque or the Muslim community for resolution. If that is not done or does not result in a resolution of the dispute, the dispute is to be presented to an Islamic judge for determination, and that is or can be an A\u2019lim.\"\n\nNielsen went on to explain that \"the remainder of the hearing will be to determine whether Islamic dispute resolution procedures have been followed in this matter.\"\n\nNielsen, a registered Republican appointed to the bench in 2000 by Gov. Jeb Bush and subsequently elected in 2003, soon found himself facing a firestorm of criticism from conservative bloggers and media outlets.\n\nOn March 22, 2011, he issued a five-page opinion on the case outlining his reasons for basing his decision on Islamic Law.\n\nHe noted that the Islamic Education Center is \"governed by a 'constitution' drafted by an Islamic A\u2019lim. Part of the evidence considered by the court was a document entitled 'Organizational Structure of the Islamic Education Center of Tampa as described in its constitution which was adopted on September 25, 1993' \u2026 This document guides the operation of the IEC.\"\n\nNielsen wrote: \"Decisional case law both in Florida and the United States Supreme Court tells us that ecclesiastical law controls certain relations between members of a religious organization, whether a church, synagogue, temple or mosque.\"\n\nThe judge went on to cite a 1992 Florida District Court of Appeals ruling (Franzen v. Poulos) that said trial courts can't intervene in internal church disputes -- or synagogue, temple or mosque. He explained that the DCA ruling said the First (freedom of religion) and 14th Amendments (due process and equal protection) allow religious organizations to set their own rules and regulations, including \"creating tribunals to adjudicate disputes.\"\n\nAfter Nielsen\u2019s March 3 ruling, the defendant in the case, the Islamic Center of Tampa, petitioned the Florida District Court of Appeal to intervene. The center contends that Nielsen should base his decision on state law, not religious doctrine, said their attorney Paul Thanasides.\n\nFor now, the case remains stalled until the DCA reaches its decision, Thanasides said.\n\nForeign law in U.S. courts\n\nWe were curious how often judges use something other than state law in ruling in American courts, so we consulted with two international law experts.\n\n\"It's much more common than you would think,\" said Markus Wagner, a professor of international law at the University of Miami's School of Law.\n\nWagner said that in deciding what laws to base his decisions on, a judge will look at the provisions agreed to between the two parties when they entered their contract.\n\n\"If we both sign a contract agreeing to be governed by German law, then Florida courts will interpret German law,\" Wagner said.\n\nWagner said the only time a judge will not consider upholding a decision based on foreign law is if it \"contravenes public policy.\"\n\n\"There are certain fundamental principles that every country holds dear,\" Wagner said. For example, \"If the punishment included bodily injury, that's not our public policy. If certain rules say you may no longer speak your mind, that would go against the First Amendment rights ... Those penalties would not be enforced.\"\n\nWhile the use of Sharia laws in the courtroom seems to have captured the most interest from the media and bloggers, Wagner said judges can make rulings based on religious laws. But again, only if the parties involved entered into an agreement under those religious laws from the beginning.\n\n\"It happens all the time, it's just that no one writes about it,\" Wagner said. \"We could use Jewish law, Canaanite law, so long as it doesn't contravene public policy.\"\n\nWe also checked with Ed Mullins, chairman of the international law section of the Florida Bar, to gauge how common it is for a judge to use foreign law in a Florida court.\n\n\"This is very common and uncontroversial,\" Mullins said. \"It's something lawyers are familiar with, but the lay person may not realize that this is very common.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nSo back to the Hasner\u2019s statement: In a lawsuit between private citizens, a Florida judge \"announced the decision was going to be based on Islamic Law.\"\n\nThe current case is still being played out in Hillsborough County District Court, and Judge Nielsen\u2019s own written opinions show that Hasner is correct about the judge's reliance on\u00a0Islamic Law in the case. However, the judge's point is that it's not simply a dispute between two private parties. The issue\u00a0involves religious law, and the legal experts support Nielsen turning to that\u00a0body of law to resolve it. Whether Nielsen's decision will stand up after review by Florida District Court of Appeal is still unknown. For now,\u00a0we rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 8, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13152"}
