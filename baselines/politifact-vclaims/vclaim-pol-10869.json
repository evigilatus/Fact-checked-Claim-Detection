Chris Christie touts himself as a chief executive who tightened Trenton\u2019s purse strings, squeezing out excess spending while paring down state government.\n\nBut a Democratic state legislator claims the Republican governor\u2019s proposed budget makes history for two costly reasons.\n\n\"This is the biggest spending budget in the history of the state of New Jersey. It is the largest in the nation at this point in time, that just was written by the governors of the nation,\" Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Vincent Prieto (D-Hudson) said during an interview on My9 News' \"New Jersey Now\" that aired June 17.\n\nThose are two big claims, both of which are short on facts.\n\nThe budget proposal that Christie outlined in February for the upcoming fiscal year called for nearly $32.15 billion in state spending. The Senate and Assembly are scheduled to vote on a Democratic budget proposal on Monday.\n\nThough Christie\u2019s proposal is one of the largest budget plans in New Jersey\u2019s history, former Gov. Jon Corzine proposed more costly budgets.\n\nCorzine\u2019s fiscal 2008 budget proposed $33.3 billion in spending for the year, the most in state history. Final state spending that year ended slightly higher, at $33.61 billion, according to state Treasury Department reports.\n\nCorzine proposed a $32.97 billion spending plan for fiscal 2009, but the state ultimately spent less than that, with the final tab at $30.8 billion, excluding federal stimulus aid.\n\nBut comparing apples to apples -- budget proposals to budget proposals -- the governor introduced the third largest spending plan in state history.\n\nTom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, said Prieto was referring to a larger measurement of spending that includes federal money, as well as spending from funds like the Transportation Trust Fund. By that measure, Christie\u2019s proposal includes more spending than previous budget plans.\n\nThe assemblyman\u2019s \"point is accurate,\" said Hester.\n\nBut Prieto does not make that distinction during the interview, which focused on whether the state can afford a tax cut considering lower-than-expected state revenues.\n\nAndy Pratt, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, said Prieto is including expenditures that are listed as off-budget and said the budget has never been referred to in this way. \"Only if you are looking for a way to make some kind of political point would you do it another way,\" he said.\n\nPrieto also said Christie\u2019s proposal is the largest in the nation. That\u2019s not true.\n\nHester said Prieto meant to refer to the percentage increase in state spending, not the broader measurement of spending, between Christie\u2019s proposed budget and the current budget.\n\nThe National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers released a report in June that tracks spending from states\u2019 general funds only. The report found Christie\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal 2013 increases spending by 7.2 percent over fiscal 2012.\n\nThe percentage increase in New Jersey\u2019s spending is larger than any other state, according to data in the report. California is proposing the next largest increase at 7 percent.\n\nSo by that measure, Christie is proposing the largest spending increase in the nation, but Prieto is wrong to characterize the governor\u2019s budget as \"the largest in the nation.\"\n\nThe budgets for California, New York, Texas and Massachusetts all propose to spend more in the upcoming fiscal year than New Jersey, according to data in the report.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a discussion about whether New Jersey can afford a tax cut considering lower-than-expected state revenues, Prieto said Christie\u2019s proposed budget is \"the biggest spending budget in the history of the state of New Jersey. It is the largest in the nation at this point in time.\"\n\nThe governor\u2019s fiscal 2013 budget calls for $32.15 billion in state spending. That\u2019s the third largest -- not the largest -- budget proposal in state history.\n\nA spokesman for Prieto said the assemblyman was referring to a broader measurement of spending, which includes federal funds. But Prieto did not make that distinction.\n\nAlso, New Jersey\u2019s budget is not the largest in the nation.\n\nWe rate this claim False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10869"}
