But despite substantial support from both parties, the sweeping national security reform is not without critics.\nChief among them is Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who unsuccessfully lobbied to extend bulk metadata collection authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\nThe metadata program, which allowed National Security Agency officials to collect phone data such as call length and the phone numbers involved, started in 2006 and was kept top-secret until Edward Snowden famously exposed it and other NSA information-gathering initiatives in 2013.\nThe USA Freedom Act, meanwhile, forces\u00a0the NSA to subpoena phone records from phone companies instead of collecting the data directly.\nRubio argued to keep the metadata program as is in a USA Today op-ed May 10.\u00a0\n\"There is not a single documented case of abuse of this program,\" Rubio wrote. \"Internet search providers, Internet-based email accounts, credit card companies and membership discount cards used at the grocery store all collect far more personal information on Americans than the bulk metadata program.\"\nThe metadata program has not produced a single case of abuse?\u00a0That\u2019s a strong\u00a0claim. Does it withstand scrutiny?\nWell, sort of. It depends on how you define\u00a0\"abuse.\"\nThere are two factors at play here: the actions of the NSA officials enacting the program and the legality of the program itself. First, we\u2019ll discuss those who oversaw the program. Did they \"abuse\" their power?\nThere were certainly glitches in the program, at least. Declassified 2009 documents enumerate a list of what the NSA called \"non-compliance\" instances. In one case, 3,000 phone numbers were found to have been listed as approved under the \"reasonable articulable suspicion\" (RAS) standard without having gone through the proper regulatory channels. In another, phone numbers were automatically added to an alert list without meeting the standard.\nAlthough PolitiFact Florida was able to find dozens of such instances, none of the documented cases appeared to demonstrate willful negligence of regulations. Most were corrected almost immediately, and the vast majority involved mishandling technology. As the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) wrote in its 2014 appraisal of the metadata program: \"None of these compliance issues involved significant intentional misuse of the system. Nor has the Board seen any evidence of bad faith or misconduct on the part of any government officials or agents involved with the program.\"\n\"This is one time in my life when I am going to agree with Marco Rubio,\" said Molly Bishop Shadel, a senior fellow at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for National Security Law. \"You've noted compliance issues, but that's not the same thing as intentional abuse.\"\nStephen Vladeck, a professor of Law at American University, says he sees the non-compliance issues differently.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If one defines \u2018abuse\u2019 to require intentional malfeasance, then it\u2019s a lot harder to show that the phone records program was ever \u2018abused,\u2019 \" he said. \"But that\u2019s certainly not how dictionaries define that term or how I have to imagine it\u2019s commonly understood.\"\nA quick look at Webster\u2019s shows \"abuse\" to mean, \"A corrupt practice or custom; improper or excessive use or treatment.\" \u00a0\nWe found no evidence of corruption but did find evidence of improper treatment.\nJonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity fellow at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation, noted that\u00a0the\u00a0secretive way the metadata collection program\u00a0was set up could have allowed for some willful abuses to go unreported. Put simply, there could be some abuses we don't know about.\nThe second question circles around the metadata program itself. Could the bulk metadata program be seen as one big \"abuse\" of Section 215 of the Patriot Act?\nRubio\u2019s writes in his op-ed that, \"Despite recent court rulings, this program has not been found unconstitutional, and the courts have not ordered a halt to the program. This program has been found legal and constitutional by at least 15 federal judges serving on the FISA Court on 35 occasions.\" These claims are true, but don\u2019t tell the entire story.\nAccording to the Second District U.S. Court of Appeals, the metadata program was not permitted under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The U.S. government tried to argue the program was permissible under the \"relevance\" standard of evidence collection because even seemingly immaterial phone data could have theoretically led to relevant information or become relevant in future investigations.\n\"We agree with appellants that such an expansive concept of \u2018relevance\u2019 is unprecedented and unwarranted,\" the court wrote. \"The statutes to which the government points have never been interpreted to authorize anything approaching the breadth of the sweeping surveillance at issue here.\"\nThe district court said it didn\u2019t feel the need to rule on the constitutionality of the bulk metadata program because it ruled it was not legal according to the original legislation. The court allowed the program to continue only because of the future congressional debate that could \"profoundly alter the legal landscape.\"\nEven the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board --\u00a0which found that the program was \"operated in good faith\" --\u00a0said there was no legal basis for the bulk collection of data.\u00a0\"Because the program is not statutorily authorized, it must be ended,\" the board wrote.\nOur ruling\nMarco Rubio said, \"There is not a single documented case of abuse of this program.\" Rubio\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\nThere are plenty of documented cases of misuse of the metadata collection program.\u00a0It just depends whether that misuse is what you or Rubio have in mind when you think of abuse. We found no example of intentional misuse of the program.\nAt the least, Rubio should have been more clear in in his op-ed to help readers understand the complexities of the metadata collection program.\nRubio\u2019s statement is partially accurate.
