Initially, that bill cuts taxes for all income groups.\nHere\u2019s what DeWine omits: That tax bill did not cut everyone\u2019s taxes, particularly in future years. And Cordray, who as governor would have no power to raise federal taxes, hasn\u2019t said he wants to raise taxes.\nCordray\u2019s statements about federal taxes\nThe video states that Cordray wants to reverse Trump\u2019s tax reform, but the first thing to know is that if he won the race, a governor can\u2019t control federal tax policy.\nAnd the video doesn\u2019t tell the full story about that $2,000 tax cut.\nThe tax bill doesn\u2019t cut everyone\u2019s taxes, especially for people in future years. At its start the tax bill does come close to providing tax relief for all income groups, and for most members within each group. The median household of a family of four gets about a $2,000 tax cut on average.\nThat said, the benefits of the tax bill would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers.\nOver time these broad-based tax cuts dissipate. By 2027, every income group below $75,000 sees a tax increase. Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027. That\u2019s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average.\nThe DeWine campaign cited several statements by Cordray in which he criticized the federal tax bill as a benefit to the rich.\nIn a speech to the City Club of Cleveland in December, Cordray said that the legislation helped corporations.\n\"There\u2019s slabs for them, there\u2019s crumbs for people like the middle-class people in our society,\" he said. \"I think it is wrong.\"\nIn a Dec. 20 tweet, Cordray called the bill a \"shortsighted abomination.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, Cordray tweeted that the tax bill brings \"more trickle-down economics that doesn\u2019t trickle down.\"\nCordray has echoed a talking point by Democrats that cherrypicks the impact of the tax bill. The tax bill gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent by 2027 due to the expiration of several important middle-income tax cuts and a change in how inflation is calculated. However, through 2025, the share of benefits going to the top 1 percent is much smaller, at roughly 20 percent to 25 percent.\nWe didn\u2019t find any statements by Cordray weighing in on any specific proposal to replace the tax bill. We asked Cordray\u2019s spokeswoman what he wants to see happen with federal tax policy and if he wants to raise or lower taxes for any particular group.\n\"Rich wants to see a federal tax plan in place that doesn\u2019t hurt middle class families,\" his campaign spokeswoman Lacey Rose said.\nIf Congress later changes the federal tax law, it could raise taxes on some people -- but it could also lower taxes on others. And even if such a bill were to gain traction, as a governor Cordray would have no say.\nCordray\u2019s statements on state taxes\nDeWine\u2019s video focuses on federal taxes, but we will briefly note Cordray\u2019s position on state taxes because that is something in the power of a governor. We found that Cordray has been critical of state tax cuts and has called for certain tax incentives for businesses, but has been vague on the details.\nThe clearest example we found in which he opposed tax increases was a May article by the Dayton Daily News which paraphrased Cordray saying he didn\u2019t see a need for tax increases. Cordray said he wanted to prioritize state spending, including less for failing charter schools and more for local government to deal with the opioid crisis.\nHe has criticized state tax cuts because that has trickled down to local governments facing choices about whether to raise their own taxes.\nAt a gathering of union leaders and local government workers in April, Cordray slammed Republicans\u2019 \"mania\" for cutting taxes.\nHe vowed that as governor, \"if the legislature continues down its current path of tax and budget cuts, there will be vetoes.\"\nOur ruling\nDeWine said that \"Richard Cordray wants to raise your taxes by reversing President Trump's tax reform.\"\nWhile Cordray has repeatedly bashed the federal tax bill, DeWine ignores that the bill didn\u2019t cut everyone\u2019s taxes, particularly in future years, and that repealing the bill, which could include a replacement, could end up cutting taxes for some families. While Cordray has made it clear that he criticizes the bill for helping the rich, he hasn\u2019t laid out any specific suggestion for changing the federal tax law.\nPerhaps more importantly, if Cordray wins the governorship, he would not have a vote on federal tax policy.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7956ec8e-caab-4423-96b4-bfbe42d6a951", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01822"}
