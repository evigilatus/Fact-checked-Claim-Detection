Scott Walker and 10 percent under Democrats Jim Doyle and Mary Burke", "text": "Gov. Scott Walker has used surveys by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state\u2019s largest business group and a key supporter of his, to make statements about how good business leaders feel about Wisconsin since he took office.\nSome of the claims have been off the mark.\nIn February 2012, Walker said 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state \"is heading in the right direction\" and a majority say they will \"grow their companies in 2012.\" We rated his statement Half True.\nWhile the figures were cited correctly, they came from a relatively small Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce survey that was not reflective of the overall makeup of businesses in the state. Walker presented the figures without noting the critical limitations.\nOn May 30, 2014, the Wisconsin Republican Party issued a statement about unemployment that contrasted Walker with Mary Burke, the leading Democratic candidate in the November 2014 gubernatorial election. Burke served as state commerce secretary under Walker's predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, for part of Doyle\u2019s tenure.\nThe GOP\u2019s claim:\n\"Under Walker, employer confidence now stands at 95 percent; at the end of the Doyle-Burke administration, employer confidence was only 10 percent.\"\nThe GOP's evidence\nWhen we asked for evidence to back the claim, the party cited the latest WMC survey, which was released in January 2014.\nWMC said that from November through mid-December 2013, it sent surveys by mail and email to 1,291 chief executive officers who are WMC members, and that 341 (26 percent) responded.\nThe GOP said its claim centered on Question 21, which asked:\n\"Do you think things in Wisconsin are going in the right direction, or on the wrong track?\"\nThe results: Right direction -- 95 percent; Wrong track -- 5 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, in WMC\u2019s June 2010 survey, the last done before Walker\u2019s election, the figures were 10 percent \"right direction,\" 90 percent \"wrong track.\"\nBut Burke served as Doyle\u2019s commerce secretary for less than three years of Doyle\u2019s eight-year tenure, leaving the post in November 2007.\nIn WMC\u2019s June 2007 survey, the final one before Burke left Commerce, 59 percent said things in Wisconsin were going in the right direction -- much greater than the 10 percent in the June 2010 survey.\nMoreover, like Walker's claim, the GOP claim was broad and without any qualifications.\nAs stated, the claim suggests the overwhelmingly positive figures for Walker reflect the opinions of business leaders statewide.\nBut as we noted in our Walker factcheck, \u00a0the survey respondents don\u2019t match up well with Wisconsin\u2019s statewide business profile.\nA majority of survey respondents in the latest survey were chief executive officers of manufacturing businesses. But\u00a0manufacturing establishments are just 6 percent of Wisconsin\u2019s businesses. Similarly, WMC represents some small businesses, but half its 3,500 members have more than 50 employees.\nOn more specific questions, the results of the latest survey weren\u2019t quite as positive for Walker. For example: 44 percent of the responding CEOs said they planned to add employees in the next six months; 65 percent said they expected moderate growth in the Wisconsin economy in the next six months and 2 percent expected good growth.\nOur rating\nThe state Republican Party said that under Walker, \"employer confidence now stands at 95 percent,\" compared to \"only 10 percent\" at the end of the Doyle- Burke administration.\nThe statement contains an element of truth, in that 95 percent of chief executive officers who are members of Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, and who responded to the latest WMC survey, agreed that \"things in Wisconsin are going in the right direction\" rather than \"on the wrong track.\"\nBut the claim ignores critical facts in suggesting that the 95 percent figure applies to all Wisconsin employers, when in fact the CEOs responding to the survey are not a representative sample of all employers.\nAnd although only 10 percent said the state was going in the right direction at the end of Doyle\u2019s term in 2010, the rate was 51 percent in the survey done shortly before Burke left Commerce in 2007.\nWe rate the state GOP\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07739"}
