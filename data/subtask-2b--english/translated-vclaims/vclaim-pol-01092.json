The issue remains strong for the party. In January 23rd tweet, Sena Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, sent a picture that says: \"7 million Americans are now more uninsured than when President Trump was elected.\" The percentage of Americans without health insurance has reached its highest level since 2014, and another 7 million Americans are now not insured compared to what was the case when President Trump was elected. We should expand access to affordable health care, not cut it off. Photo.twitter.com/aRWINCjm5-Sen. Maria Cantwell (@Senator Cantwell) 23 January 2019 included the Cantwell tweeting source - the national health and welfare index in Gallup. However, her tweet did not mention that two widely respected federal studies show much less erosion of insurance coverage since Tramp &apos; s election in 2016. Let's take a look at the numbers. In its National Health and Welfare Index, Gallup Survey publishes quarterly data on the number of Americans lacking health insurance. For its figures, the company scans about 10,000 adults from the United States aged 18 years and over each month. In this graph by Gallup, which shows the historical trend of the uninsured rate in recent years: in producing its findings in the fourth quarter of 2018, Gallup wrote: \"The level of the day is the highest in more than four years, well above the low of 10.9 per cent in 2016. The increase of 2.8 per cent is due to a net increase of about 7 million adults without health insurance.\" This corresponds to what Cantwell wrote on Twitter. However, Gallup data show the most extreme rise in the uninsured rate; other data show a relatively slight change. \u2022 The Census Bureau \"US health insurance coverage: 2017\" showed an increase in the number of non-insured persons of 492,000 between 2017 and 2016. This is the height, but it's almost one of the fourteen larger than what Cantwell mentioned. They rejected Nancy Belusi's request for open security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021. If you instead use \"not insured at least for part of last year\" -- various statistics collected by the CDC survey -- there was essentially no change in the ranks of the uninsured during that period. The long-term historical figures for the CDC study are as follows: it should be noted that different studies have some differences in methodology. \"Every survey that measures health insurance coverage and those who are not insured comes up with somewhat different answers,\" said Linda Bloomberg, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. \"They all have different questions, different order of questions within the scan, different sample sizes, different sampling frames.\" For example, the CDC survey does not cover adults over 65 years of age, whereas Gallup covers them. Perhaps the most important advantage of Gallup's data is that it contains the three most recent data - a factor that Brian Watt, Cantwell's spokesman, referred to in an interview with Politi Factwat also to another non-governmental survey conducted by the Commonwealth Fund, showing an increase in the uninsured rate since 2016, a result consistent with Gallup's findings. According to the Commonwealth Fund survey, the uninsured rate for non-old adults was 12.7 per cent in February/April 2016, 14 per cent in March/June 2017, and 15.5 per cent in February/March 2018. However, Bloomberg said that there were reasons to rely on government studies, particularly the one published by the CDC. \"Gallup is newer, but it also shows larger changes than NHIS in recent years,\" she said. The CDC study was \"higher response rate, and was transparent as to whether any questions or methodology for data collection had changed. Given the differences in the way in which these surveys measure changes in the number of uninsured persons, it is most likely preferable to acknowledge this and to be careful not to draw conclusions very quickly.\" Gale Welinski, who headed medical care and Medicaid under the leadership of President George H.W. Bosch, it's a deal. She said: \"We'll know more when the census office or the CDC makes up-to-date estimates.\" \"In the meantime, politicians must stop their fire.\" Our rule has been quoted by Cantwell, \"7 million Americans are now more insecure than when President Trump was elected.\" The tweet refers to one study on health insurance coverage, carried out by Gallup. However, it ignores two Government studies that closely monitor and show much smaller changes in uninsured Americans and, in one case, it has in fact found a modest decrease in the number of people without insurance. We evaluate the statement half right.
