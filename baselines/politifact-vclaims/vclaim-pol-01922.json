The story said that Russell showed Trump\u2019s \"famous foes that it\u2019s time to shut up about our president.\"\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe website uses actual quotes by Russell but omits when he actually said them, creating a false connection to Trump.\nThe Twentyeightmay story includes this quote by Russell:\n\"This is a business that\u2019s heavily promulgated by people who have a politically liberal bent. I don\u2019t begrudge them that. I\u2019m a libertarian; frankly, I think my liberalness goes far beyond theirs in a lot of ways.\"\nThe story said that Russell made those comments in response to Meryl Streep\u2019s comments at the Golden Globes. But Streep\u2019s criticism of Trump for imitating a disabled reporter occurred at the awards ceremony in January 2017 while that quote by Russell was published in September 2016 in an interview with Stephen Whitty, a freelance critic at the time for The New Jersey Star-Ledger.\nWhitty told PolitiFact that Russell \"was talking, very generally, about being a libertarian or conservative in Hollywood\" and that he didn\u2019t recall him ever mentioning any candidate by name.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe twentyeightmay story also said that Russell recently said: \"The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political.\"\nRussell did make that statement, but that was on The View in December 2015 when Whoopi Goldberg asked him about his recent comments that he believed gun control laws wouldn\u2019t deter terrorists. At the time he made statements about gun control, he was discussing his upcoming movie The Hateful Eight, directed by Quentin Tarantino.\n\"The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political. It's just something I can't stand watching. So having said that, no, I was asked, I was asked to put it in context somehow with this movie. You know, my personal feeling is that there's a big difference between fantasyland and reality. Fantasyland is what we do. You're either writing something, writing a song, writing a book, doing a movie, doing a television show. That's fantasyland. And that\u2019s where that stuff belongs.\"\nRussell continued, saying that people have different opinions about how to deal with terrorism and he talked about his views on why the Founding Fathers included the Second Amendment.\nWe were unable to find any contact information on the twentyeightmay website.\nOur ruling\nA story by the Twentyeightmay website said that actor Kurt Russell said that celebrities shouldn't \"get political\" when it comes to Donald Trump.\nThis is a case of using an actual quote by an actor but taking it out of context to create a false impression.\nRussell said in a December 2015 interview on The View, \"The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political.\" But the Twentyeightmay story portrayed Russell\u2019s quotes as an attack on Trump, and that wasn\u2019t the case. The story didn\u2019t make it clear when Russell made these statements.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/40e049e0-18b4-415b-900e-1060ee31effb", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01922"}
