The company has told investors it would owe $1.7 million in taxes and penalties if it loses the case, according to the Associated Press.\nThe Democrat accused Cuccinelli of ignoring the case, rather than taking the company to court -- a charge Cuccinelli vehemently denied, but McAuliffe continued.\n\"Finally a judge took the case away from him because of a conflict of interest,\" McAuliffe said.\nWe asked Josh Schwerin, McAuliffe\u2019s campaign spokesman for proof that a judge removed Cuccinelli from the case.\nSchwerin cited a May 6, 2013 order from Mecklenburg Circuit Court Judge Leslie M. Osborn that moved the case from Cuccinelli\u2019s office to two attorneys at the Richmond-based Troutman Sanders law firm who are representing the state on a pro bono basis.\nTechnically, McAuliffe has a point in that a judge did take the case away from Cuccinelli.\nBut McAuliffe\u2019s campaign omits a major point -- the fact that the judge did that at the request of the attorney general\u2019s office.\nIn a motion that was signed by the pro bono attorneys -- Stephen D. Rosenthal and William H. Hurd -- Virginia assistant attorney general Elizabeth B. Myers requested that outside counsel handle the case.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe motion granting that request makes no reference to whether the attorney general has a conflict of interest. It\u2019s merely a pro forma order granting the request to switch counsel.\nCuccinelli asked to be removed from the case after Democrats accused him of a conflict of interest in representing the state in the case involving Williams -- who had given Cuccinelli $13,000 in gifts. Cuccinelli later disclosed that he received an additional $5,000 in gifts.\nCuccinelli also disclosed -- belatedly -- his sale of Star Scientific stock because he said he hadn\u2019t realized its value had crossed the $10,000 threshold above which the state requires \u00a0disclosure.\nIn a prepared April 5 statement, Cuccinelli explained his decision to remove the attorney general\u2019s office from the case and appoint outside attorneys to handle it.\n\"To be clear, there was absolutely no conflict of interest with the attorney general\u2019s office,\" Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for the attorney general said in the statement. \"But in an abundance of caution, and to move past what has become an unnecessary distraction for the office and the attorney general, the case was given to outside counsel.\"\nGottstein went on to say Cuccinelli was not personally involved in the tax case and that the attorney general\u2019s office had filed all of its required pleadings within court deadlines.\nBut In a March 22 article, the Associated Press quoted Paul Campsen, a private Norfolk attorney who specializes in tax litigation saying the attorney general\u2019s previous connection to the case \"isn\u2019t just the appearance of a conflict, it is a conflict of interest.\"\nOur ruling\nMcAuliffe said a judge took the Star Scientific tax case away from Cuccinelli.\nThere is a grain of truth in McAuliffe\u2019s claim, because a judge did indeed grant a motion removing the attorney general from the case. But McAuliffe\u2019s statement is misleading because it ignores some crucial information -- the fact that the attorney general\u2019s office was the one that requested to be removed from the case.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09026"}
