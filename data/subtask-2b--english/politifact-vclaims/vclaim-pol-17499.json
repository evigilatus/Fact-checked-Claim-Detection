But the method isn\u2019t as widespread as the social media posts make it out to be.\u00a0\nThe posts are similar to another alarmist hoax we debunked related to zip ties and sex trafficking.\n\nA screenshot of a viral Facebook post warning women about a zip-tie contraption allegedly used by sex traffickers to distract women.\nWe searched news archives for reports of sex traffickers using zip ties and found no record of the contraption described in the social media posts being used to distract women at their cars.\nWe read about these posts in multiple reports from news outlets in Canada. According to those reports, the image started making the rounds in January, with posters claiming an incident occurred at a mall in the city of Burnaby. A separate post circulating at the same time said sex traffickers were also placing $100 on car doors as a different form of distraction.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurnaby police said on Twitter that they were aware of the posts and that they were \"unable to find any report or investigation that fits this criminal activity.\" They said the information in the posts was causing \"unnecessary concern\" to city residents.\nThe FBI declined to comment when asked if incidents involving the zip-tie contraption had cropped up in the United States.\u00a0\nThe Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking, said they haven\u2019t identified the method as a trend.\u00a0\nHuman trafficking often occurs between people that know each other, rather than complete strangers, and it doesn\u2019t always involve a form of physical restraint, the group said.\n\"By far the most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it always \u2014 or often \u2014 involves kidnapping or otherwise physically forcing someone into a situation,\" the Polaris Project said. \"In reality, most human traffickers use psychological means such as tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims.\"\nShared Hope International, a nonprofit, Christian organization with a similar mission, told us that \"trafficking victims are generally not kidnapped or taken away from their families abruptly.\"\nThe bottom line: It\u2019s important to stay aware of your surroundings, and should you want to report or seek services related to a case of human trafficking, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or email [email\u00a0protected].\nBut the Facebook posts about zip ties \u2014 like similar posts before it \u2014 are an example of an unsubstantiated warning.\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17499"}
