They kept coming back, Trump said, and when he asked why, they told him their schools had \"no funding.\"\n\"President (Barack) Obama would never give them long-term funding, and I did,\" Trump said Oct. 22. \"Ten-year, long-term funding, and I gave them more money than they asked for because I said, \u2018I think you need more.\u2019 \u2026 But I saved historically Black colleges and universities.\"\n\nWhen Trump signed the bipartisan FUTURE Act in 2019, he did make permanent $255 million in annual funding for minority-serving colleges, including roughly $85 million earmarked as mandatory funding for historically Black colleges and universities under a Title III program.\nBut it\u2019s inaccurate for Trump to claim that he \"saved\" HBCUs, or that they had \"no funding\" before him.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\nTrump signed the FUTURE Act\nThe Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities program has given Congress an avenue to award grants to HBCUs for decades.\u00a0\nThe Title III program, authorized as part of the Higher Education Act of 1965, is funded with annual discretionary appropriations and the additional annual mandatory appropriations made permanent by the FUTURE Act, according to the U.S. Education Department.\u00a0\nBefore the FUTURE Act kicked in, HBCUs had to ask Congress each year to renew the mandatory funding, as PolitiFact has reported. The act marked a significant change, and organizations that support HBCUs heralded the move.\nBut Trump\u2019s claim likely overstated the role he played in making the law a reality. The president did sign the bill when it hit his desk, but it\u2019s not clear that he did other legwork to get it there.\n\"The only words the president contributed were his signature, \u2018Donald J. Trump,\u2019\" Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C., an original sponsor of the bill, told Inside Higher Ed in August.\nTotal funding for the program has trended\u00a0up under Trump. However, the president\u2019s budget proposals for the last three years show the White House\u00a0repeatedly requested less in discretionary funding through the program than Congress provided.\nThe White House has also tried to trim funding for federal TRIO programs, which are designed to provide services to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the Trump administration hasn\u2019t been supportive of HBCUs. In 2018, for example, Education Secretary Betsy Devos issued full forgiveness on hurricane relief loans granted to four HBCUs in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.\nBut as other fact-checkers have noted, Trump\u2019s insistence that he \"saved\" HBCUs goes too far. His debate-night claim also ignored that HBCUs received money via the Title III program every year under Obama, according to\u00a0the U.S. Education Department.\u00a0\n\"President Trump did no more for HBCUs than any other U.S. president, but I don\u2019t know of anything that he has done that has had a disproportionately negative impact on HBCUs,\" said Ivory Toldson, a professor at Howard University who served as an HBCU liaison for the Obama administration. Toldson added that presidents have limited control over the federal budget.\nFederal funding for HBCUs comes in other forms\nThe program impacted by the FUTURE Act isn\u2019t the only source of federal funding for HBCUs, although experts said it makes up a sizable amount. The schools can seek funding through grants, contracts and cooperative agreements with federal agencies, Toldson said.\n\nThe campus of Morehouse College in Atlanta\u00a0on April 12, 2019. (AP)\nMoney also flows indirectly to students in the form of Pell Grants, said Krystal L. Williams, an assistant professor of higher education at the University of Alabama, who co-authored a 2019 report on HBCU funding sources for the American Council on Education.\u00a0\nThose funding sources predate both the Trump and Obama administrations, Williams said.\nPublic HBCUs are generally more reliant on federal, state and local funding than their non-HBCU counterparts, the report found. Private HBCUs also lean more heavily on money from tuition than their non-HBCU counterparts, where private gifts are more common.\nToldson and Williams crunched the numbers on HBCU funding for PolitiFact using data on the individual institutions\u2019 reported revenues from the National Center for Education Statistics. Due to a reporting lag, the data excludes the most recent years under Trump and does not account for emergency funds delivered as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\nHBCUs received a total of $1.9 billion from the federal government in appropriations, grants and contracts in 2017-2018, compared with $1.8 billion in 2016-2017 and between $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion annually under Obama, Toldson said. Both Toldson and Williams said the highest investment occurred in 2009-2010, as the nation recovered from the Great Recession.\n\"There is no evidence that the Trump administration's investment in HBCUs is the highest compared to previous administrations,\" Williams said, countering another administration claim.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"President Obama would never give them long-term funding, and I did \u2026 I saved historically Black colleges and universities.\"\nTrump signed the FUTURE Act into law, making a major funding stream for HBCUs permanent beyond 2019. But it\u2019s a stretch to say he \"saved\" them from financial ruin. The schools received federal dollars, including via the same Title III program, under Obama.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18785"}
