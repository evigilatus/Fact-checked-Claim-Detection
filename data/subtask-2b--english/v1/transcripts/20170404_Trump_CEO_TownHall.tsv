0001	Donald Trump	Thank you, Mike.
0002	Donald Trump	Good morning.
0003	Donald Trump	Hello, Ivanka.
0004	Reed Cordish	I know you know a few of the people in this room.
0005	Donald Trump	I do.
0006	Donald Trump	I do.
0007	Donald Trump	All the killers from New York  I'm looking at all those competitive  those great, great talents, great builders.
0008	Reed Cordish	I have to give you a headsup that Ivanka chaired one of the sessions before this  tough act to follow.
0009	Donald Trump	Oh, she's tough.
0010	Donald Trump	Very tough.
0011	Reed Cordish	Vice President Pence listed some of the amazing accomplishments that have taken place since your election and your 75 days in office.
0012	Reed Cordish	The stock market has had almost unprecedented sustained growth, unprecedented confidence from our manufacturing sector and other business sectors, leading to massive private sector investment in job growth.
0013	Reed Cordish	You have gotten rid of regulations that were unnecessary and were jobstifling.
0014	Reed Cordish	You have strengthened our borders and strengthened our military.
0015	Reed Cordish	You've nominated a great  superb Supreme Court justice, amongst many other things.
0016	Reed Cordish	How does all that feel?
0017	Donald Trump	And we're getting unbelievable credit for what we've done, other than the mainstream media, which just gives us no credit whatsoever.
0018	Donald Trump	But we are getting tremendous credit.
0019	Donald Trump	And if you look at the real estate industry, the mining industry, the farming industry  if you look at any of the major industries you see what's going.
0020	Donald Trump	In fact, even today I was very happy as I read this morning early that our trade deficit with others has gone down very considerably in the last short period of time.
0021	Donald Trump	It's having a big impact.
0022	Donald Trump	And, as you know, I'm meeting with the President of China on Thursday and Friday in Palm Beach, Florida, and I think we're going to have a very interesting talk.
0023	Donald Trump	We're having  have a lot of respect for him.
0024	Donald Trump	I've spoken to him numerous times.
0025	Donald Trump	But we have to do better, because our deficit with China, as you know, $504 billion.
0026	Donald Trump	That's a year.
0027	Donald Trump	That's enough for a lifetime.
0028	Donald Trump	Even Steve would say that.
0029	Donald Trump	But that's a year.
0030	Donald Trump	So we're going to have a great meeting, I'm sure we're going to have a fantastic meeting.
0031	Donald Trump	And we're going to talk about a lot of things, including, of course, North Korea, a problem.
0032	Donald Trump	And that's really a humanity problem.
0033	Donald Trump	So we're going to be talking about that also.
0034	Reed Cordish	You have made it a driving force in this administration to bring in the best minds we can from the private sector, to listen intently to them and to take decisive action.
0035	Reed Cordish	How important is that, and how important is it to reform government to bridge the gap between the private and public sectors?
0036	Donald Trump	Well, I did, I brought you, I brought Gary Cohn, I brought a lot of very great people  my friend, Steve, is helping us out.
0037	Donald Trump	We have a superstar committee of 22 people.
0038	Donald Trump	And every time somebody calls me I say, Steve, put them on  no, we want to keep it at this level.
0039	Donald Trump	The heads of the biggest companies, they all want to be on our committee, right, Stephen?
0040	Donald Trump	But Steve likes to keep it very small.
0041	Donald Trump	But they will go off and they'll disappear and we'll put others on.
0042	Donald Trump	But we've had some great meetings and we've all learned a lot.
0043	Donald Trump	One thing that did come up, and it came up yesterday, was Gary Cohn  where's Gary?
0044	Donald Trump	Is he here?
0045	Donald Trump	Could you bring that chart, please?
0046	Donald Trump	Do you mind?
0047	Donald Trump	Let me see that chart.
0048	Donald Trump	So this was just something  this is sort of incredible.
0049	Donald Trump	That's so beautiful.
0050	Donald Trump	Yeah, no, you're not quite  this is to build a highway in the United States  now, this was just done yesterday.
0051	Donald Trump	I saw it for the first time.
0052	Donald Trump	I said, I'm speaking to some of my friends who are builders, really great builders, and they've gone through the process  we've all gone through it in New York  we call it the zoning process in New York.
0053	Donald Trump	But you start up here and this is anywhere from a 10 to 20year process.
0054	Donald Trump	You have  is it 17 agencies.
0055	Donald Trump	You have hundreds and hundreds of permits.
0056	Donald Trump	Many of them are statutory, where you can't even apply for the second permit until six months go by.
0057	Donald Trump	So this is to build a highway.
0058	Donald Trump	This is a simple highway.
0059	Donald Trump	And these are the agencies  so it's 17 agencies.
0060	Donald Trump	How many different steps is it?
0061	Question	Sixteen different approvals.
0062	Donald Trump	Sixteen.
0063	Question	Twentynine different statutes.
0064	Question	Five different executive orders that all apply to this process.
0065	Question	This is indicative, so this is not a specific project, but this is the type of process that a government  this is a state government  would have to go through to permit a highway federally.
0066	Question	This is just federal, not state regulations.
0067	Donald Trump	So it can take anywhere from 10  if you're really good, 10 years to 20 years.
0068	Donald Trump	And then they vote, and you lose.
0069	Donald Trump	They don't want it.
0070	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0071	Donald Trump	And it costs sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars just to go through the process.
0072	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0073	Donald Trump	That was a great job you did.
0074	Donald Trump	Be careful, don't fall.
0075	Donald Trump	I don't want to have you fall.
0076	Donald Trump	You'll be a big story in the paper if you go down.
0077	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0078	Donald Trump	So I just saw that yesterday.
0079	Donald Trump	Gary Cohn walked in and he showed it to me, and  for no reason.
0080	Donald Trump	I said, you have to do me a favor.
0081	Donald Trump	But a lot of you, you're such pros, some of the best pros in the world sitting in this room, you understand it.
0082	Donald Trump	It's a process.
0083	Donald Trump	Now, I've always liked it because it gave people that could go through that process an advantage, like Jerry, but it gave us an advantage if you could get through the process.
0084	Donald Trump	But getting a building approved in New York is a horrible, horrible thing.
0085	Donald Trump	And that's nothing compared to when you get into the highways and the dams  they don't even talk about dams anymore.
0086	Donald Trump	Hydropower is a great, great, form of power  we don't even talk about it, because to get the environmental permits are virtually impossible.
0087	Donald Trump	It's one of the best things you can do  hydro.
0088	Donald Trump	But we don't talk about it anymore.
0089	Donald Trump	So we've come to a halt.
0090	Donald Trump	We have a tremendous person that we put in charge of EPA, Scott Pruitt, who is an environmental person.
0091	Donald Trump	He wants clean air, he wants clean water, but he doesn't thing it takes you 26 years to get a permit to build a building and to have jobs, at which time those companies are usually gone, out of business, et cetera.
0092	Donald Trump	So we're really speeding up the process.
0093	Donald Trump	We're going to try and take that process from a minimum of 10 years down to one year.
0094	Donald Trump	I said can't we make it four months?
0095	Donald Trump	Can't we do it in four months?
0096	Donald Trump	And there is a certain logic to that, but we'll be satisfied with the year  but it won't be any more than a year.
0097	Donald Trump	So we have to build roads.
0098	Donald Trump	We have to build highways.
0099	Donald Trump	We're talking about a very major infrastructure bill of a trillion dollars  perhaps even more.
0100	Donald Trump	And when we have to do  our jobs  I mean, if we say, we're giving to New York City hundreds of millions of dollars to build a road someplace, it doesn't help if they can't start because it's going to take seven and a half years to get the permits.
0101	Donald Trump	Even to redo a road takes years to get the permits.
0102	Donald Trump	You know, you have a road that's there and you want to redo it, and you have to get new permits for the kind of asphalt you're using, the kind of concrete you may want to use.
0103	Donald Trump	And if we're going to give all of this money  you know, there was very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration  a trillion dollars  nobody ever saw anything being built.
0104	Donald Trump	I mean, to this day, I haven't heard of anything that's been built.
0105	Donald Trump	They used most of that money  it went, and they used it on social programs.
0106	Donald Trump	And we want this to be on infrastructure.
0107	Donald Trump	I'm working with Steve Roth and with Richard LeFrak  two friends of mine that are very good builders.
0108	Donald Trump	They're great builders.
0109	Donald Trump	And they know to get things done.
0110	Donald Trump	They know how to cut red tape.
0111	Donald Trump	We're going to give them the advantage of having what we have.
0112	Donald Trump	I see Elaine is here, so important, who is doing an incredible job, by the way  Secretary of Transportation.
0113	Donald Trump	And Elaine will be working.
0114	Donald Trump	But we're going to set up a committee headed by Steve and Richard, and we're going to cut a lot of red tape.
0115	Donald Trump	But we don't want to send a billion dollars to New York and find out, five years later, the money was never spent, because we're going to be very strong that it has to be spent on shovels, not on other programs.
0116	Donald Trump	And in the last case, a lot of it was spent on other programs.
0117	Donald Trump	But we're going to say, if you don't spend the money  if you don't start  if you have a job that you can't start within 90 days, we're not going to give you the money for it.
0118	Donald Trump	Because it doesn't help  doesn't help us.
0119	Donald Trump	And we're going to be very strong on that.
0120	Donald Trump	They have to be able to start within 90 days.
0121	Reed Cordish	Mr. President, we have some of the great business leaders in the country here.
0122	Reed Cordish	If okay with you, they have a few questions, if that's 
0123	Donald Trump	Sure.
0124	Reed Cordish	Great.
0125	Donald Trump	Hello, Jerry.
0126	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0127	Jerry Speyer	Hi, Mr. President.
0128	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0129	Donald Trump	He didn't have to say his name.
0130	Donald Trump	He was ready to say his name  we know.
0131	Donald Trump	Jerry Speyer, everybody.
0132	Jerry Speyer	Mr. President, you're doing a great job, and we're all really grateful to you for the sacrifices you're making.
0133	Jerry Speyer	Hope you heard that.
0134	Donald Trump	That sounds much better.
0135	Jerry Speyer	I think from New York's point of view we send a lot of money into the economy.
0136	Jerry Speyer	As a number of people have said, it's over a trillion dollars.
0137	Jerry Speyer	We're worried we're going to have a problem with Congress.
0138	Donald Trump	With the deductions, right?
0139	Jerry Speyer	Well, that, too.
0140	Jerry Speyer	That, too.
0141	Jerry Speyer	But we're worried about various programs that help the city.
0142	Jerry Speyer	The city is doing fine right now  even the Yankees are doing fine.
0143	Jerry Speyer	But what we're really concerned about is the future.
0144	Jerry Speyer	Do you have any advice for us?
0145	Donald Trump	Look, I love New York.
0146	Donald Trump	And in some ways we're all lucky that I'm from New York,, because New York has unique problems.
0147	Donald Trump	So does Los Angeles, so does Chicago.
0148	Donald Trump	There are places that have unique problems.
0149	Donald Trump	One of the problems that you have is debt and deductibility.
0150	Donald Trump	That's a big one, because a lot of the states that don't have debt or have very little debt  like in the case of Mike Pence, where he did such a good job in Indiana, and it's a AAArated bond, one of the strongest in the country, and deductibility is not that big of a deal because they don't have that much to deduct.
0151	Donald Trump	And over here, in New York, when you look at what's going on with us, we don't know in terms of the municipality and in terms of the state, we don't know if it can even make it if you don't have that.
0152	Donald Trump	Are people going to buy?
0153	Donald Trump	So it's a very big problem.
0154	Donald Trump	And the problem I have is that there are many places throughout the country that are in the exact opposite position.
0155	Donald Trump	And they consider that a gift to the state and a gift to the people.
0156	Donald Trump	And we know New York does things that a lot of people don't read about.
0157	Donald Trump	You look at what  the money they contribute to our economy, to our country, and people don't know about that.
0158	Donald Trump	They don't maybe want to know about that.
0159	Donald Trump	So you do have  I call it a tale of two cities.
0160	Donald Trump	You have different interests.
0161	Donald Trump	But I am watching over everybody, Jerry.
0162	Donald Trump	You're in good hands, okay?
0163	Donald Trump	You're in good hands, believe me.
0164	Donald Trump	You can tell the people of New York.
0165	Donald Trump	Even though I didn't win New York State.
0166	Donald Trump	I should have won New York State, but I didn't.
0167	SYSTEM	[Applause, Laughter]
0168	Cathy Engelbert	Mr. President, Cathy Engelbert with Deloitte.
0169	Cathy Engelbert	I want to return to a conversation we just had with Ivanka, Dina and Wilbur on jobs, the workforce of the future.
0170	Cathy Engelbert	And so as we think about that and we think about our skillsets, in New York City alone our high school  public high school graduation rate is at 70 percent, but the readiness of our students for college and careers is only 37  it's assessed at 37 percent.
0171	Cathy Engelbert	So as we look at the pace of change, we look at the digital transformation we all see in business and the marketplace, and we look at the skills that  this disconnect between what employers need and what our students coming into our workforces are prepared to deliver.
0172	Cathy Engelbert	It would be great to get your thoughts on the priorities of the administration around education, around, again, what I like to call not the future of work but the work of the future.
0173	Cathy Engelbert	Because the future of work sounds a little ominous, but the work of the future actually sounds pretty visionary.
0174	Cathy Engelbert	So if you could give us those priorities 
0175	Donald Trump	Okay, so before you sit, so you're giving me numbers from New York.
0176	Donald Trump	You're a proud New Yorker, but you're giving me numbers  why is it doing so badly?
0177	Donald Trump	Tell me.
0178	Donald Trump	Why are the numbers so horrific in terms of education?
0179	Donald Trump	And what happens when somebody goes through school and then they can't read after  they graduate from high school and they can barely read.
0180	Donald Trump	So what's the answer?
0181	Cathy Engelbert	Yes.
0182	Cathy Engelbert	So, first, I would say that as we look at New York, New York has made enormous progress in a decade.
0183	Cathy Engelbert	By the way, that 70 percent was 50 percent, so a 40 percent increase.
0184	Cathy Engelbert	So we're making enormous progress in making an impact on 
0185	Donald Trump	See how quickly she's changing?
0186	Donald Trump	See that?
0187	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0188	Cathy Engelbert	Making enormous progress, but we're not done.
0189	Cathy Engelbert	We have a lot of work to do.
0190	Cathy Engelbert	And I think  we talked earlier about publicprivate partnerships, apprenticeship models, which  we have a beautiful apprenticeship model that works and brings them our next generation of leaders.
0191	Cathy Engelbert	So I do think there's a lot we can do through relooking at funding programs.
0192	Cathy Engelbert	We talked earlier about consolidating the many programs that are out there.
0193	Cathy Engelbert	We're all trying to make our individual impact and we can make a huge impact together.
0194	Donald Trump	Sure.
0195	Donald Trump	I know you work very hard on it and you have made progress.
0196	Donald Trump	Charter schools are another thing that people are talking about a lot, and some of the charter schools in New York have been amazing.
0197	Donald Trump	They've done incredibly well.
0198	Donald Trump	People can't get in.
0199	Donald Trump	I mean, you can't get in.
0200	Donald Trump	I don't call it an experiment anymore, it's far beyond an experiment.
0201	Donald Trump	If you look at so many elements of education, and it's so sad to see what's coming  what's happening in the country.
0202	Donald Trump	Even the numbers, as good  you say we're doing better, but the numbers in New York, the numbers in Chicago are very rough.
0203	Donald Trump	The numbers in Los Angeles, the cities, it's a very rough situation.
0204	Donald Trump	Common Core  I mean, we have to bring education more local.
0205	Donald Trump	We can't be managing education from Washington.
0206	Donald Trump	When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally, and they'll do a much better job than somebody  and look, these are some very good people in Washington, but you also have bureaucrats that make a lot of money and don't really care that much about what they're doing or about the community that they have never seen and they'll never meet, and they never will see.
0207	Donald Trump	And I like the fact of getting rid of  Common Core to me is  we have to end it.
0208	Donald Trump	We have to bring education local.
0209	Donald Trump	To me, I've always said it, I've been saying it during the campaign.
0210	Donald Trump	And we're doing it.
0211	Donald Trump	Betsy DeVos is  she's doing a terrific job, highly respected, tremendous track record.
0212	Donald Trump	But she's got one of the toughest jobs of any of our secretaries, to me.
0213	Donald Trump	She's got one of the toughest jobs.
0214	Donald Trump	There's some pretty tough jobs out there, but she's got one of the toughest jobs.
0215	Donald Trump	We're going to spend a lot of money and a lot of expertise.
0216	Donald Trump	We're going to have great talent having to do with education, because there's nothing more important than education.
0217	Donald Trump	And we've got to get those numbers in New York better, and I think they will be better.
0218	Donald Trump	And a lot of people  a lot of the greatest people I know in New York, they're totally involved, including Ivanka and Jared, they're so much involved, and it's so important to them, the word "education."
0219	Donald Trump	And it's happening, and I see it happening in New York very much.
0220	Donald Trump	But it's happening elsewhere, too.
0221	Donald Trump	I think we're going to have a great four years.
0222	Reed Cordish	Mr. President, I know you have 
0223	Donald Trump	Prior to running again.
0224	Reed Cordish	 a pressing issue to deal with.
0225	Reed Cordish	Steve and Mike I think just wanted to thank you for attending today, and maybe make a final comment on behalf of 
0226	Stephen Schwarman	Well, thanks a lot for being here.
0227	Stephen Schwarman	And thanks for everybody for being here.
0228	Stephen Schwarman	It's been a really interesting day, and you've had everybody of importance at the event.
0229	Stephen Schwarman	I think it's terrific in terms of the stuff you're trying to do to modernize the government, educate, and so forth.
0230	Stephen Schwarman	And I think we have to keep a focus on that, because the outside world doesn't always get the message that that's really what's going on  because you're doing profound things, taking on enormous embedded issues.
0231	Stephen Schwarman	And I think with the kind of effort that can be marshaled, you can do amazing things.
0232	Stephen Schwarman	And that's on behalf of Mike Corbat and myself who chaired the Partnership  it's sort of trust, and gets rotated from person to person every two years.
0233	Stephen Schwarman	I want to wish you really good luck with the Chinese.
0234	Stephen Schwarman	That's an important thing, as we all know.
0235	Stephen Schwarman	And I think there's a real opportunity to make progress with them.
0236	Stephen Schwarman	And you should have a good time in Florida.
0237	Stephen Schwarman	I hope the weather is good.
0238	Donald Trump	Yeah, the weather will be beautiful.
0239	Donald Trump	Thank you, Steve.
0240	Donald Trump	I just want to finish by saying that we are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads over not eight years, over the last 20 and 25 years.
0241	Donald Trump	You have regulations that are horrendous.
0242	Donald Trump	DoddFrank is an example of what we're working on, and we're working on it right now.
0243	Donald Trump	We're going to be coming out with some very strong  far beyond recommendations  we're going to be doing things that are going to be very good for the banking industry so that the banks can loan money to people that need it.
0244	Donald Trump	I speak to people all the time.
0245	Donald Trump	They used to borrow money from banks to open up  there's one in Nevada  to open up a pizza shop here, three shops  he had a bank, and he said, you know  at that time he called me "Mr. Trump" because I hadn't won yet  but he said, "Mr. Trump, I can't open up anything I can't do anything.
0246	Donald Trump	The banks don't even  I had a bank for 20 years now they don't even take my phone call.
0247	Donald Trump	And I was always a very good customer.
0248	Donald Trump	So I haven't been able to do what I do."
0249	Donald Trump	They can't do it.
0250	Donald Trump	I mean, the banks got so restricted.
0251	Donald Trump	And I've always said  and some people get insulted  but, you know, it's not necessarily the man that's making a lot of money that's running the bank.
0252	Donald Trump	You look at the folks from government that are running all over the banks, they're running the banks.
0253	Donald Trump	And the people that are really the head people, they're petrified of the regulators.
0254	Donald Trump	They're petrified.
0255	Donald Trump	They can't move.
0256	Donald Trump	The regulators are running the banks.
0257	Donald Trump	So we're going to do a very major haircut on DoddFrank.
0258	Donald Trump	We want strong restrictions, we want strong regulation, but not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs.
0259	Donald Trump	But we're doing  that's just one example.
0260	Donald Trump	We're doing so many cuts on regulations.
0261	Donald Trump	And we have a book on regulations, and if you add them all up, it goes up to the ceiling three times over.
0262	Donald Trump	It's just one after another after another.
0263	Donald Trump	It's just like that chart.
0264	Donald Trump	I thought that chart was so descriptive.
0265	Donald Trump	And every industry is just like that chart, and that's to build a simple roadway or highway that's what you have to go through.
0266	Donald Trump	And we're going to be able to get rid of 90, 95 percent of that and still have the same kind of protection.
0267	Donald Trump	And we want safety and we want environmental  we want environmental protection.
0268	Donald Trump	I've won awards on environmental protection.
0269	Donald Trump	I'm a big believer, believe it or not.
0270	Donald Trump	But we want that kind of protection.
0271	Donald Trump	We want clean air and we want clean water, but we shouldn't have to get the approvals from 16 different agencies for almost the same thing.
0272	Donald Trump	So we have a country with tremendous potential.
0273	Donald Trump	We have the greatest people on Earth, but we have to use that potential and we have to let those people do their thing.
0274	Donald Trump	And with that, I just want to thank you all.
0275	Donald Trump	I think you're going to see a very much different environment than you've been used to over the last, again, 20, 25 years.
0276	Donald Trump	We're going to unleash the country.
0277	Donald Trump	And I'm willing to take the heat, and that's okay.
0278	Donald Trump	I've been taking the heat my whole life.
0279	Donald Trump	But in the end, I know it's the right thing to do.
0280	Donald Trump	And we're going to create a lot of jobs.
0281	Donald Trump	We have 100 million people, if you look  the real number is not 4.6 percent.
0282	Donald Trump	They told me I had 4.6 percent last month, I'm doing great.
0283	Donald Trump	I said, yeah, but what about the 100 million people.
0284	Donald Trump	A lot of those people came out and voted for me.
0285	Donald Trump	I call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman.
0286	Donald Trump	But a lot of those people, a good percentage of them, would like to have jobs, and they don't.
0287	Donald Trump	One of the statistics that to me is just ridiculous  so the 4.6 sounds good, but when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up  you are now considered statistically employed.
0288	Donald Trump	But I don't consider those people employed.
0289	Donald Trump	If you look at what's happened with Ford and with General Motors and with FiatChrysler and so many other car companies, you see what they're doing back in Michigan and Ohio  they were leaving.
0290	Donald Trump	They were going to Mexico and many other places.
0291	Donald Trump	They're now staying here.
0292	Donald Trump	Now, I did say  Reed knows this very well, because you've seen me say it many times to the big auto companies at meetings  it's okay, enjoy your new plant please send me a picture, I'm sure it's going to be lovely.
0293	Donald Trump	But when you make your car or when you make your air conditioner, and you think you're going to fire all of our workers and open up a new place in another country, and you're going to come through what will be a very strong border, which is already  you see what's happened 61 percent down now in terms of illegal people coming in.
0294	Donald Trump	Way, way down in terms of drugs pouring into our country and poisoning our youth.
0295	Donald Trump	Way down.
0296	Donald Trump	General Kelly has done a great job.
0297	Donald Trump	But when you think you're going to sell that car or that air conditioner through our border, it's not going to happen.
0298	Donald Trump	You're going to have a tax.
0299	Donald Trump	And the tax may be 35 percent.
0300	Donald Trump	And you know what, every single major company that I've had that conversation with has said, you know, we've decided to stay in the United States.
0301	Donald Trump	It's amazing.
0302	Donald Trump	And you would have thought they would have said this, frankly, for years.
0303	Donald Trump	But nobody has ever said it.
0304	Donald Trump	And we've lost close to 70,000 factories over a relatively short period of time  70,000.
0305	Donald Trump	You wouldn't believe it's possible, Reed, to lose 70,000 factories  70,000.
0306	Donald Trump	You know, you look at a map of the United States  how many factories can you lose?
0307	Donald Trump	We lost almost 70,000 factories.
0308	Donald Trump	And I will tell you, that's not happening, because now they're staying here and they're all expanding here.
0309	Donald Trump	Ford announced last week a massive expansion of three of its plants.
0310	Donald Trump	That was not going to happen, believe me, if I didn't win.
0311	Donald Trump	So, good luck, everybody.
0312	Donald Trump	Enjoy yourselves.
0313	Donald Trump	You're my friends.
0314	Donald Trump	You're amazing people.
0315	Donald Trump	And we're going to put you to work.
0316	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0317	SYSTEM	[Applause]
