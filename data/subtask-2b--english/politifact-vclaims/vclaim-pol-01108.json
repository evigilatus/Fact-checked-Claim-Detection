If anyone has set up the keypad to steal your pin code, this will cancel that set up. Please make it a habit and part of every transaction that you make. Please share with those about whom you care.\"\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe tip has been shared on social media since at least November 2018, when the same claim was also posted on Twitter.\nWhile it is true that scams can impact customers using an ATM machine, we couldn\u2019t find any reports from cybersecurity, banking or law enforcement organizations that recommend pressing the cancel button twice to prevent information from being stolen.\nWe spoke with Dr. Vassil Roussev, a professor of computer science at the University of New Orleans and the director of the UNO Cyber Center, an institution dedicated to research and instruction in the area of Information Assurance.\n\"There are relatively simple electronic devices made by different criminal groups that get reproduced and sold, and there\u2019s a fairly large number of them, so it is possible that some very simple ones could be disturbed by something like this,\" Dr. Roussev said, \"but it should not, in any way, be taken as a safety precaution. It won\u2019t hurt you, but I would place zero value on this type of advice.\"\nDr. Roussev explained that many designs, particularly keypad overlays, which attaches a fake keyboard over an ATMs real one, may record everything that is pressed, so pressing cancel twice or 50 times would make zero difference.\nHe went on to recommend that people take actual safety precautions, such as not using random ATMs or ones where they don\u2019t trust the physical security, because those are targeted by scammers most often.\nTypically, crooks will use a variety of techniques to capture customers information. Here are some of the most common ones compiled from the American Bankers Association and NCR, an ATM developer.\nSkimming: A slim device containing a microprocessor and flash memory that is attached to a card reader slot that copies card information as it passes the device. Once the information is captured, criminals use the details to create a cloned card. \u00a0\nCash trapping: \u00a0A contraption inserted into the cash-dispensing slot that blocks an ATM\u2019s shutter so that bills cannot be presented to the customer. The criminal then retrieves the cash once the customer leaves.\nCard trapping: The stealing of the physical card itself through a device fixed to the ATM.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlimited cash-out: Malware manipulates system controls, inflates account balances and removes daily transactions limits, enabling criminals to withdraw an unlimited amount of cash.\nFake keypads or \"pin-pad overlays\": These could potentially be used to steal a PIN number.\nHidden camera: To record customer keystrokes, like the entry of a PIN, or the card\u2019s information.\nHere are some of the best practices financial institutions do suggest people exercise when using an ATM:\n\u2022 When you\u2019re alone, avoid using ATMs in deserted areas, or ones that are obstructed from view or poorly lit. Use ATM\u2019s in public, well-lit areas, like inside banks or supermarkets.\n\u2022 Be aware of your surroundings. If you notice anything out of the ordinary or suspicious cancel your transaction and leave immediately. You can come back later or find another ATM.\n\u2022 If it looks like someone has tampered with the ATM equipment in any way, don\u2019t use it and report it.\n\u2022 Type in your pin discreetly and shield the screen and keypad so others can\u2019t see.\n\u2022 Put your cash, card and receipt away immediately. Count your money later where others can\u2019t see and avoid showing your cash.\n\u2022 Take your receipts with you so potential criminals will not know how much you withdrew or how much money is in your account.\n\u2022 When using a drive-up ATM, keep your doors locked, windows up and your engine running.\n\u2022 When using an enclosed ATM that requires your card to open the door, avoid letting anyone follow you inside.\n\u2022 While many ATMs are available 24 hours a day, try to go during the day. If you must go at night, consider taking someone with you.\nATM scams are diverse and range from simple to very advanced. While pressing the \"cancel\" button twice before using the machine doesn\u2019t have any drawbacks, customers shouldn\u2019t expect it will keep their information safe.\nThis claim is Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-01-23 12:39:15 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  When using an ATM, customers should \"press the cancel button twice before inserting the card.
