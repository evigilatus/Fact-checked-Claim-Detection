This observation followed numerous assurances from Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and thereafter that the crime was escalating. We found many of those statements misleading or false, although others are reasonably accurate. Trump's broadest statement about the increasing wave of crime was wrong, but some of his more specific statements about the increase in specific crimes in specific places were more accurate. Trump described here - that violent crime generally falls after a long rise - as misleading. (The White House did not respond to a query about this article.) Let us first look at the rate of violent crime in recent years. We turned into historical data from the FBI, which was completed until 2017. The Federal Bureau of Investigation defines violent crimes as the combined number of murders, manslaughter, rape, theft and aggravated assault. This rate shows the number of violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. This graph shows the national rate of violent crime in the FBI from 1986 to 2017: the violent crime rate fell between 2016 and 2017 (less than 1 per cent) and was the first time since 2014. However, three years have hardly been a \"long period\" since then, especially since the violent crime rate has fallen from year to year in 22 of the last 27 years. In fact, the rate of violent crime in 2017 was about half of what peaked in 1991. \"The short-term rise occurred after a long slice,\" said James Alan Fox, a crime scientist at the University of the North-East. \"The last drop was to change the return to a level that existed two years before the increase that made Trump so much.\" Trump said \"violent crime,\" but what if we look more specifically at the homicide rate? On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to install security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, the killing rate appears to be still slightly high. Unlike the violent crime rate, it did not decrease between 2016 and 2017, according to FBI statistics. It rose slightly, from 5.3 per 100,000 to 5.4 per 100,000. The overall pattern is similar to that of the violent crime rate - a peak in the early 1990s, a long decline to around 2014, and a modest rise in the past few years. The last year in which the homicide rate fell was in 2013; in 2014, it was stable. It wasn't any of the two years ago. It should be noted that other statistics on the crime cited by Tramp in his speech received better support - again, where more specific data tend to be more accurate. He said: \"The number of suppliers in the largest cities of America has fallen by 6% compared to 2016.\" This is similar to the results of a report issued in December by the Brennan Liberal Centre for Justice at the New York University School of Law. That report - based on early data for large cities rather than official FBI data throughout the year we used above - found that \"the murder rate in 2018 in the top 30 cities is estimated at about 6 per cent.\" (The base year was 2017, not 2016, as Tramp said.) Trump also said, \"In the two years before my inauguration, violent crime increased by 8 per cent throughout the country, and homicides increased by more than 20 per cent.\" The FBI's data shows that Trump is close. The violent crime rate rose by 7 per cent between 2014 and 2016, and the homicide rate increased by 18 per cent during the same period. Our Governor Trump said, \"The flagrant crime is now down for the first time in a long time.\" Violent crime has been on a downward path for some time, sometimes rising. Official data of the Federal Bureau of Investigation show that the rate of violent crime decreased very slightly - by less than 1 per cent - between 2016 and 2017. However, those statistics have recently declined in 2014, falling in 22 of the last 27 years, with the average day of half of what it was in 1991. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.
