One person &apos; s health care refers to a health insurance plan for each person paid for by one entity, such as the Government. But as an old warrior, Multon said he knew directly \"good, bad and ugly\" for such an approach. His service makes him eligible for health coverage through the Veterans Management Health System, which is often cited by single-payers as an American success story. While prescription drugs are an interesting subject for presidential candidates, an interesting claim was made during CNN City Hall earlier this month: \"VA negotiates prices for prescription drugs. Medical care doesn't do that.\" Molton has been representing the sixth Congressional Chamber in Massachusetts since 2019 and announced his candidacy for president in April on ABC News. During this interview he said, \"I think I'm the only candidate who gets health care from a single batch.\" Some of the issues emphasized by Multon in his presidential programme are national security, national education, health care and mental health. Molton was a commander of the U.S. Navy and competed for four rounds of combat in Iraq. After Multon filed the claim, he added, \"This means that our prescription prices in AA are lower than Medicare. When asked about the source of the conclusion on prescription pricing, Molton Matt Coridone cited an online paper in the Health Economics magazine in April 2011. In order to verify Multon &apos; s claim, we asked health-care experts whether it was true that the Ministry of Veterans &apos; Affairs negotiated prices for medicines but medical care did not. All of them said that Multon's claim was correct. \"VA uses a completely different system for determining the prices of medicines, and also has a formula - unlike medical care,\" said Trisha Neuman, Senior Vice-President of the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation for the Family and Director of the Foundation's Program on Medical Care Policy. On January 13, 2021, in a story, General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for epithelial security, and told her, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman, on January 17, 2021, \"Medicari delegates this job to private pharmaceutical schemes (section D), which negotiates with pharmaceutical companies, leading to changes in drug prices through plans,\" she said, \"Medicari's commissioning this function to private medical care companies (section D), which negotiates with pharmaceutical companies, leading to changes in drug prices through plans.\" Gilad, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Health Policy at the University of Pittsburgh, presented another context for his claim. Gilad said: \"The Attorney General negotiates prescription prices on behalf of all VA patients, even though they also benefit from a law setting the maximum amount they pay for prescription.\" \"Incidentally, it is not the service providers who negotiate, but the government agency itself.\" Gilad explained that the Association negotiated prices on behalf of its beneficiaries, but the medical care institution did not negotiate on behalf of the people it covered. Economic Gail Wilensky, former head of medical care under George H.W. :: Bush and a senior colleague at the Health Hope Project noted that there is a major difference between agencies: the Health Care Act covers some 6 million people, and some 44 million medical-care beneficiaries. \"The use of guided pricing - where the Government determines the price as for medical care doctors and hospitals - is more complex for medicines because of the long cycle of lead in their development,\" said Whelinski. \"Medical care centres, medical assistance services and the United States Department of Health and Human Services have no experience negotiating prices for anything. This will be a difficult place to start - with the possibility of many unintended consequences.\" Whelinski said that a specific problem was the time taken to develop drugs: it might take \"ten years from when drug development begins to reach the market.\" Whelinski said that \"this means that if the pricing given to the various medicines has been inappropriately developed, it will not be felt or respected for a decade. While if the rates of doctors are inappropriately established, the decline will feel fast.\" However, medical care is already engaged in some negotiations, as Gilad has noted, but not by the Government on behalf of its beneficiaries. Gilad said, \"Medicare does not allow health plans that offer drug benefits to negotiate on behalf of its members. The prices of drugs through VA do not tend to be less than medical care, experts told us. \"Description prices in VA are lower than medical care, partly because of the law that I mentioned, but also certainly because VA is able to negotiate on behalf of all its members,\" said a executioner. Our verdict, Multon, said the D.A. was negotiating prices for drugs, but medical care wasn't. All our experts have said that the claim is true. The law does not allow medical care to negotiate prices on behalf of its beneficiaries. The Health Insurance Act - comprising 6 million patients - is negotiated and has a legally imposed limit on the prices of medicines it describes. We're assessing this statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00556"}
