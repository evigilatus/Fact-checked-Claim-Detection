Kathleen Vinehout, D-Alma, about what the average worker would save from the tax cut approved in 2013 by Republican lawmakers and Gov. Scott Walker.\nVinehout, who is mulling a run for governor this fall, opposed the tax cut, as did many Democrats. She says the savings for individual families wasn\u2019t worth the $650 million in lost revenue to the state over two years.\nThis is what she told a small audience in Waukesha on Dec. 5, 2013:\n\"Get rid of the tax decrease,\" Vinehout said. \"Did you know -- you might not know this -- if you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes? You might not have known that because they didn\u2019t change the withholding tables, so it didn\u2019t show up in your paycheck.\"\nShe added: \"But, if you file for your refund, and let\u2019s say you file it a little late, and you get that refund sometime in June, you\u2019ll maybe have a little more money, which might be just about the time the governor\u2019s is out there on the campaign trail saying, hmm, you got more money in your pocket because of what I gave you.\"\nLet\u2019s examine the elements of Vinehout\u2019s claim.\nCheck\u2019s in the mail\nWisconsin Revenue Department spokesperson Laurel Patrick confirmed that withholding tables were not updated after the tax cut, and said no decision has been made to do so in 2014 either. The tax cut reduced rates in all five tax brackets.\nThat means the tax-rate changes are not automatically reflected on people\u2019s paychecks. To get the tax savings on their regular paycheck, employees must file a new WT-4 or WT-4A form with their employer.\nTodd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the state, with a few exceptions, has long tried to help its immediate cash flow needs by not automatically making tax cuts show up on people\u2019s paychecks. The practice predates Walker.\nThe state is now over-withholding by 20 percent or more because it has typically not adjusted the tables, Berry said.\nMany taxpayers may prefer getting a lump sum at refund time, Berry said, but they should understand that as a group they essentially are giving state government a billion-dollar annual no-interest loan that adds to the state deficit under generally accepted accounting principles.\n\"Politicians know it\u2019s more politically valuable for people to get a nice refund in 2014,\" Berry said.\nWhat\u2019s the savings?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of Vinehout\u2019s claim was that \"if you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes\" under the income tax cut.\nWhen we asked for evidence, Vinehout\u2019s office pointed to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis of the tax savings from the income-tax changes, and to separate state figures on tax burdens.\nThe average Wisconsin adjusted gross income, across all types of filers, was $47,310 for tax year 2010, according to a Revenue Department analysis. There is 2011 data, the latest available, that puts the figure at $48,537, according to Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance.\nVinehout looked up that average income in the June 2013 memo by the non-partisan Fiscal Bureau, which presents ranges of income along with tax changes estimated for 2014.\nThe Fiscal Bureau is the independent budget scorekeeper in Madison, and its reports on taxes are used by both parties to gauge the impact of proposals.\nThe bureau\u2019s analysis said that in the $40,000 to $50,000 range, the average savings is $85 for one year.\nThat works out to $1.63 a week, which Vinehout referred to as $1.60 in her claim.\nSo, Vinehout puts the average income into the slot, and with a bit of rounding her figure for the average tax change is on target.\nThere\u2019s some imprecision built in here, though, because the Fiscal Bureau memo uses income ranges rather than one particular income.\nSo while Vinehout mentions $50,000, she gets the $1.60 average tax change from an income range of $40,000 to $50,000. And because the average state income is above the midpoint of that range, it\u2019s likely the average tax change would differ slightly from the $1.60.\nThere are other ways to illustrate the impact of the tax cut. One is to look at the types of filers rather than just the composite income brackets as in the Fiscal Bureau memo.\nDepending on the example used, one approach yields a smaller tax change figure than Vinehout\u2019s approach, the other a larger one.\nThe average single person who filed taxes had $26,556 in income, while married couples had an average of $83,480, said Knapp.\nWalker, for his part, chooses the married couple example. Such a couple with two children would save about $173 a year, or $3.33 per week over the two years.\nOn the lower end, the average single would see a weekly savings of about 73 cents.\nThe overall state average that Vinehout cites is a middle ground between those two numbers.\nOur rating\nVinehout said that \"if you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes\" under the $650 million state income-tax cut, but \"it didn\u2019t show up in your paycheck.\"\nThe average income she cites is slightly high but within reasonable rounding range. She uses a reliable source for her tax-change numbers, and they are on target or very close, with the caveat that the analysis is set up for income ranges rather than a precise income.\nShe\u2019s right that the tax cut did not just show up in workers\u2019 paychecks, due to inaction by the state.\nWith the clarifications noted, we rate her claim Mostly True.\nIf you wish to comment on this item, please click here to go to JSOnline.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08406"}
