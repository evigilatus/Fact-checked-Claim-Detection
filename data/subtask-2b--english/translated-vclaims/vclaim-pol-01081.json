He described himself as a lifelong democracy, who developed a reputation as a socially conscious leader while overseeing the huge coffee company for 32 years, and told CBS Scott Bailey in January 27 that he would run as \"a separate post outside the two-party system.\" At some point in the interview, the billionaire reflected on the financial pressures that he said motivated him to run for the highest state office. \"When I read statistics that say that more than 40 percent of the American people don't have $400 in the bank and just a crisis away from bankruptcy... that's what I'm thinking.\" The claim emerged as a stark description of everyday life in America, so we wanted to know whether it was accurate. Our report found that Schultz &apos; s claim was on the right track, although it was slightly overestimated. This is not the first time we've checked an American financial claim from Schultz's store. In 2015, Starbucks published an eight-page listing in the United States of America today explaining why she wants to start a national conversation about race. These statistics included: \"Whites control almost 90% of the nation's wealth.\" We've evaluated it right. It corresponds to the latest net value figures from the Fed system at that time. Did you ever hear that? We mentioned the Schultz statement 40 percent of something the former journalist in Washington Post Hunter Schwarters said in 2015 before joining CNN. Schwartz said that 47% of Americans \"can't pay for the unexpected $400 through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money.\" Bondit Fuckett estimated this claim to be true. As our colleagues have stated, Schwartz &apos; s statement was based on the results of a nationally representative sample of American adults who completed an online survey conducted by the Federal Reserve in October 2014. When asked how they would pay the $400 contingency, 53 per cent said that they would be able to pay immediately, while 47 per cent said that they could not. However, this was based on a survey conducted more than four years before Schultz spoke his statement, and the press release was somewhat more accurate. So, let's dig. We didn't hear from Schultz's office what he used as a basis for his statement. But the Fed did its survey, in what is known as the \"United States Economic Welfare Report.\" Households, each year since 2013. The latest results, released in May 2018, were covered by NPR, CNBC, Forbes, Fox Business and other national media. On January 13, 2021, in a story written by General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines to secure the launch, he said, \"We are not working for you.\" So this is not direct evidence that 40% of Americans don't have at least $400 in a bank account. However, according to the survey, the 40 percent did not have that much to examine or save; or they said that they would instead borrow or sell something to cover expenses. The Fed noted that 40 per cent represented an improvement over half of adults in 2013 because they were not prepared for such expenditures. There are two noteworthy points before we conclude: a report issued in April 2018 on the World Centre of Excellence in Financial Literacy at George Washington University concluded that 36 per cent of the population could not receive $2,000 in the coming month to cover emergency expenses - a measure similar to that of 400 dollars immediately. \u2022 Given the overall decline in unemployment and a good economy, this figure may now be lower than the 40 percent mentioned in the Fed survey. Our governor Schultz said, \"More than 40% of the American people don't have $400 in the bank.\" According to the latest Fed survey, Schultz is on the right track: 40 per cent of Americans said that if they faced an emergency expenditure of $400, they would not be able to cover it, or would have to borrow or sell something to cover it. We're mostly evaluating Schultz's statement.
