The data is the latest available from the\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau, though it comes from a 2016 analysis.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED: Is Wisconsin a Top 10 state for business (from 2017)\nIn line with Johnson\u2019s tweet, the SBA reports those small businesses employ 49.9% of all workers in Wisconsin. The report puts the tally at 1.3 million, however, not the 1.2 million Johnson referenced.\nThat percentage would of course drop dramatically with a smaller definition of \"small.\" Businesses with fewer than 20 employees accounted for about 500,000 jobs in 2016, which would be around 20% of the state workforce.\n\nDoes that make Wisconsin a great state for small business?\nNone of that speaks to whether Wisconsin is a good state for small business.\nThe\u00a0Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship tackles that task to an extent, using a variety of datasets to gauge each state\u2019s rate of new entrepreneurs, number of new businesses starting due to opportunity (i.e. if the owner is coming from unemployment or another job), jobs created by new businesses and percentage of new businesses that survive their first year.\nAcross all those measures, Wisconsin\u00a0ranked 46th among the 50 states and Washington, D.C. in 2017. That\u2019s up from dead last in 2016 but still the fourth straight year in the bottom 10.\nThat\u2019s just one of many potential indicators of the state\u2019s business climate, based on surveys and data analysis. Some are more positive on Wisconsin, but most place Wisconsin at or below average.\nThat led then-Gov. Scott Walker to get a\u00a0Mostly False rating in 2017 for picking the most glowing of the recent results to claim Wisconsin was a Top 10 state for business.\nOur ruling\nJohnson\u2019s tweet said small business is a big deal in Wisconsin, accounting for more than 99% of all businesses and half of all employment.\nThat claim \u2014 based on the federal definition of a \"small\" business \u2014 is in line with the latest data.\nWe rate his statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00664"}
