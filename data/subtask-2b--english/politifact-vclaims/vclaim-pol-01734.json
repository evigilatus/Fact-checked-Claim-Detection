The amendment was pushed by an advocacy group,\u00a0Marsy\u2019s Law for All, founded to prevent situations like the one experienced by the family of Marsy Nicholas.\nNicholas was stalked and killed by her ex-boyfriend in 1983, according to the Marsy\u2019s Law for NC\u00a0website. A week after Marsy\u2019s death, her family was confronted by her accused murderer in a grocery store and the family \"had no idea that he had been released on bail,\" the site says.\nThe\u00a0proposed amendment\u00a0would include granting victims\u2019 families the constitutional right to be present at court proceedings of accused felons, the right to be informed of a jury\u2019s ruling, and the right to know if the convicted perpetrator has escaped or been released from prison.\nAmong the most common criticisms of the proposal is that it might slow the legal system and add costs.\nHowever, a completely different worry recently emerged on the\u00a0BlueNC blog, which is run by former Democratic gubernatorial candidate\u00a0James Protzman. Protzman created a poster describing each of the amendments.\n\"Victim\u2019s rights will be extended to any class of people the legislature wants, including fetuses. This amendment will pave the way for making abortion illegal under North Carolina\u2019s constitution,\" the Blue NC description of the victims\u2019 rights amendment says.\nPolitiFact doesn\u2019t often focus on blogs unless their content becomes widely distributed. In this case, the poster was\u00a0shared on Facebook\u00a0by Wayne Goodwin, chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, and Goodwin\u2019s post was shared more than 700 times.\n\u2018Who knows?\u2019\nAbortion is legal in the United States but regulations vary by state. For example, in North Carolina, there are restrictions on abortion after 20 weeks, and taxpayer money can\u2019t be used for abortions except for pregnancies caused by rape, incest or where the mother\u2019s life is endangered, according to the\u00a0Guttmacher Institute, an advocacy group that promotes sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States. North Carolina also gives medical providers the right to refuse abortion services and requires potential abortion patients to wait 72 hours after a consultation, the institute says.\nWhen contacted by PolitiFact, Protzman explained by email he\u2019s critical of all six amendments because they\u2019re vague. He pointed to this line in the legislation: \"The victim or, if the victim is a minor, is legally incapacitated, or deceased, a family member, guardian, or legal custodian may assert the rights provided in this section.\"\n\"So let\u2019s say you\u2019re the estranged husband of a woman who has an abortion. Under this amendment, you could assert all the rights of a family member on behalf of the fetus, and then impose the requirements of the amendment on your estranged wife. You could even assert, on behalf of the \u2018victim,\u2019 that felony murder took place,\" Protzman said.\n\"Would this happen? Who knows? But it could. And given the willingness of Sen. Berger and Speaker Moore to bend legislative rules to suit their agendas, I wouldn\u2019t bet against it,\" he added.\nBut that hypothetical scenario is not only extremely unlikely, experts said, it\u2019s also irrelevant. The victims\u2019 rights amendment,\u00a0which has no mention of abortion or reproductive rights, would still have no bearing on the legal status of abortion in North Carolina.\n\u2018Absurd\u2019\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory Wallace, a professor at Campbell University School of Law, noted the amendment applies only to people who are victims of a crime, and identifies specific procedures the court must follow to grant those rights. He described Protzman\u2019s claim as \"absurd.\"\n\"The proposed amendment does not authorize a person to accuse someone of a crime or to make something a crime that is not already unlawful,\" Wallace said in an email.\n\"Under the Constitution and current law, the aborted child is not treated as a victim of a crime,\" Wallace continued. \"The aborted child therefore would not have any rights under the proposed amendment, nor does the proposed amendment do anything to change current abortion law.\"\nMarsy\u2019s Law for NC, the group pushing the amendment, echoed that sentiment.\n\"Marsy\u2019s Law is not about abortion rights \u2014 it\u2019s about strengthening rights for victims of crime,\" the group said through Chris Sinclair, general consultant for the Marsy\u2019s Law for NC campaign.\n\"Special interest groups are in high gear on social media spreading misinformation about Marsy\u2019s Law, the amendment that will strengthen constitutional rights for victims of crime in North Carolina,\" the statement says. \"Their glib misinformation campaign is an attempt to mislead voters, and ultimately will hurt crime victims and their families who deserve equal rights in the state constitution - rights that the accused and convicted already have.\"\nSkye David, an attorney with New Frame in Raleigh, focuses on victims of sexual assault as part of her lobbying work. She told PolitiFact in an email the proposed law could, in theory, apply to an abortion case. But it\u2019s \"unlikely that it could qualify as felony murder because there would be no attempt to commit a felony under (statute).\"\n\"I\u2019m certainly open to hearing how this could/would be more common, but don\u2019t think that this would be a common or even uncommon case.\" The proposal is unlikely to pave the way for making abortion illegal, she said.\nFederal law trumps state law\nJohn Dinan, an expert on the N.C. Constitution who teaches at Wake Forest University, says he has kept track of the states that started adopting victims\u2019 rights amendments, a trend that started in the 1980s, and then the second wave of states that adopted Marsy\u2019s Law amendments.\n\"Of the various critiques that have been advanced about these amendments during the campaigns \u2014 and there have been various critiques \u2014 concerns about the effects on abortion rights have not figured prominently in the debates and campaigns about the amendments,\" Dinan told PolitiFact in an email. \"Far more common have been concerns about whether these amendments will place an undue burden on prosecutors and court systems.\"\nThe proposed North Carolina constitutional amendment is no different, he said.\n\"In looking at the original victims\u2019 rights amendment (added to the North Carolina Constitution in 1996) and then examining the changes that would be made by the 2018 Marsy\u2019s Law amendment, it is not clear to me which of the 2018 changes would have the claimed effect on abortion rights,\" Dinan said.\nJeff Powell, an expert at Duke University, emphasized that the state can\u2019t pass any new abortion restrictions that violate federal law. And the Supreme Court has ruled that abortion rights are protected by the U.S. Constitution.\n\"As long as there\u2019s a federal constitutional rule on abortion, that trumps whatever North Carolina will do,\" Powell said.\nOur ruling\nBlueNC said the proposed victims\u2019 rights constitutional amendment will \"pave the way for making abortion illegal.\" Attorneys and legal experts say the path to such fallout not only is unclear, but unlikely. One expert described the claim as \"absurd.\" And Protzman failed to offer evidence that an amendment which is completely unrelated to reproductive rights could outlaw abortion.
