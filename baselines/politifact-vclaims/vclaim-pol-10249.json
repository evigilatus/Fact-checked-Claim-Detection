Robert Menendez says Paul Ryan\u2019s budget would transform Medicare into a voucher system", "text": "U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez yesterday attacked a Medicare reform proposal from Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan by claiming it would turn the health care program into a voucher system.\n\nThe Democratic senator made that criticism during a debate last night against his Republican challenger Joe Kyrillos, a state senator representing Monmouth County.\n\n\"But listen what I don\u2019t want to do is what my opponent says, he basically embraces the Ryan budget. But what does the Ryan budget do?\" Menendez said. \"It ends Medicare as we know (it), makes it a voucher, privatizes Social Security, dramatically cuts assistance to education in our country.\"\n\nFor this fact-check, we\u2019re focusing on Menendez\u2019s claim that the Ryan budget would turn Medicare into a \"voucher.\"\n\nWe issued a Mostly True ruling on a similar claim in September from state Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula, and PolitiFact National issued the same ruling on a related statement by President Barack Obama in August.\n\nJust as in those two cases, Menendez\u2019s claim is mostly accurate.\n\nRyan has proposed providing \"premium support\" payments to future Medicare beneficiaries to purchase health insurance. There are some distinctions between the two terms, but the word \"voucher\" generally describes this approach.\n\nThe plan would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries and individuals who become eligible before 2023. Those individuals could remain in the current Medicare program.\n\nBut starting in 2023, newly eligible beneficiaries would receive a premium support payment to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The payments would either pay for or offset the cost of health care premiums.\n\nThe latest version of Ryan\u2019s plan was approved in March by the GOP-controlled House as part of a budget resolution, but it was later rejected by the Democrat-led Senate.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Ryan\u2019s most recent plan more closely reflects a pure premium support, but substantively, it\u2019s somewhere between the two approaches. As our PolitiFact colleagues noted, there are distinctions between the two terms, dealing with the type of inflation adjustment used and the degree of marketplace regulation imposed.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a debate Thursday against Kyrillos, Menendez claimed Ryan\u2019s budget would turn Medicare into a \"voucher.\"\n\nIt\u2019s accurate that Ryan\u2019s plan, starting in 2023, would provide premium support payments for new beneficiaries to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The term \"voucher\" generally describes this approach.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Rothman\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2012 in a speech on the House floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Republicans just voted last year to end Medicare.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill Wichert \u2022 February 19, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10249"}
