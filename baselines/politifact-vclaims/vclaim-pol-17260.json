Kelly Loeffler to QAnon, \u2018white supremacist\u2019", "text": "In a Georgia debate that could help decide which party controls the Senate, Black pastor Raphael Warnock went after white businesswoman Kelly Loeffler on race.\u00a0\n\"And she says she is against racism and that racism has no place,\" Warnock, the Democratic challenger, said of Loeffler, the GOP senator.\u00a0\n\"But she welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview. I don't think she can explain that.\"\nWarnock was referring to Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, a supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, and conservative activist Jack Posobiec, who once interviewed Loeffler.\nWarnock, pastor of the Atlanta church once led by Martin Luther King Jr., has repeatedly made the claim against Loeffler.\u00a0\nIn the debate, Loeffler didn\u2019t respond directly to the two-part attack, but said: \"There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body.\"\nLoeffler did embrace an endorsement from Greene in a campaign event, so that part is true. The evidence Warnock relies on for the other part of the claim doesn\u2019t flatly label Posobiec as a white supremacist, but notes that he has ties to people in that movement, and Posobiec and has praised some of them.\u00a0\nAccepted endorsement from QAnon supporter\nThe QAnon conspiracy theory claims public figures like Hillary Clinton, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey are part of a ring of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles, and that President Donald Trump is secretly fighting to bring it down.\u00a0\nThe FBI has described the QAnon movement as a potential domestic terrorism threat. But Greene, a former construction executive heading to Congress, has called it \"a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out,\" and has made derogatory remarks about Black people, Jews and Muslims.\nLoeffler appeared with Greene at an Oct. 15 campaign event to tout her endorsement from the House candidate. By then, Greene had won a primary runoff to represent Georgia\u2019s safely Republican 14th congressional district.\u00a0\nLoeffler praised Greene\u2019s defense of \"conservative values.\"\n\"I've gotten a lot of work done in Washington already in that regard \u2014 and I'm thrilled to know I've got a strong, conservative champion that's going to be fighting right alongside with me,\" Loeffler said of Greene.\nIn the Nov. 3 election, Greene won easily, becoming the first open supporter of QAnon to win a seat in the U.S. House.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

She said she did the interview \"to discuss why I had to call out\" the\u00a0Black Lives Matter \"political organization \u2014 and why the woke mob is trying to cancel me.\"\nTo back its claim about Loeffler sitting for an interview \"with a white supremacist,\" Warnock\u2019s campaign cited a news report about Posobiec from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and a report about Posobiec from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a social justice nonprofit that in recent years has been criticized over some of its tracking of hate groups. Those reports talk about Posobiec\u2019s association with white supremacy.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution led its article about the Loeffler interview by saying Posobiec is \"associated with white supremacy and Nazism.\" The article said Jewish groups and media observers pointed out that Posobiec \"promotes conspiracy theories and once associated with white supremacists including Richard Spencer.\"\nPosobiec has praised Spencer, a white nationalist who was one of the leaders of the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, where a white supremacist rammed a car into a counterprotester, killing her.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, in a report published July 8 on its Hatewatch blog, said Posobiec \"collaborated for years with white supremacists,\" including Spencer. \"Posobiec\u2019s ties to far-right extremists travel beyond borders into Europe. His connections to white supremacy are too numerous to compile into one article, so Hatewatch is running a series of stories on the correspondent\u2019s ties to the movement and promotion of it.\"\nThe center does not include Posobiec on its list of white nationalists, or its broader list of extremists.\n\"The only reason we have not formally listed Posobiec yet is that we are still reporting out his history within hate movements,\" Michael Edison Hayden, who wrote the Hatewatch blog post on Posobiec, told PolitiFact. \"We have more to publish about Posobiec soon, also related to promotion of an anti-immigrant politician and his collaboration with white supremacists. Do not interpret the current absence of his extremist profile as a suggestion that he is somehow less extreme than figures like Richard Spencer.\"\nBrian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said Posobiec \"has apparently cozied up to various white supremacists.\" Loeffler \"should know that granting an interview to such a person, while criticizing those who point out his bigotry and disturbing associations, legitimizes the toxic views he so dutifully promotes.\"\nLoeffler\u2019s campaign and Posobiec did not respond to our requests for comment.\nOur ruling\nWarnock said Loeffler \"welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview.\"\nLoeffler did welcome the endorsement of her campaign by a QAnon supporter.\nLoeffler gave an interview to a man who has praised a prominent white nationalist and who, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \"collaborated for years with white supremacists.\" The center does not include the interviewer on its list of white nationalists, but says it is continuing to investigate him.\nWe rate Warnock\u2019s statement Half True.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17260"}
