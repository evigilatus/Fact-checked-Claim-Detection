David Simmons, R-Longwood, to establish a memory disorder clinic at Florida Hospital in Orange County.\nLaird\u2019s office did not return a call, but we were able to find statistics that closely matched what she told the committee.\nThey were cited in \"2017 Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Facts and Figures,\" a report by the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, the leading advocacy group for patients with the severe memory-loss condition and their families and caregivers.\nThe report, in Table 4, offers projections for state-by-state numbers of residents with Alzheimer\u2019s in 2017 and 2025. For Florida, it lists 520,000 people with the disease in 2017 and 720,000 for 2025, a growth rate of 38.5 percent.\nRounded off, those are essentially identical to the figures Laird cited.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the table cites these figures as \"estimates\" (for 2017) and \"projected\" (for 2025).\nThe numbers in the report are footnoted to a study published in the academic journal Neurology in May 2013. The authors used Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis statistics from 2010 to create estimates of how many cases would be expected in future years as far out as 2050.\nGiven the margins of error in estimates and projections, and given the difficulty of diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s disease in patients, it\u2019s a slight overreach for Laird to frame these as hard numbers of Floridians who have the disease today. They are a useful yardstick and were published in a respected scientific journal, but her phrasing suggests too high a degree of certainty about the numbers who have the disease today.\n\"It is accurate to say that the numbers are estimates, or as we put it in the report, \u2018projections,\u2019 \" said Laura Cilmi, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\nOur ruling\nLaird said, \"Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness.\"\nThese numbers are sourced to a credible scientific paper, though it\u2019s worth noting that the paper deals in estimates and projections, rather than hard, verifiable numbers.
