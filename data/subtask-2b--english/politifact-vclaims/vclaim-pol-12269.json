Now he\u2019s running for president without ever having served in public office. His new book, \"This is Herman Cain!: My Journey to the White House,\" treats victory as a foregone conclusion. \u00a0\n\nAlready, he\u2019s referring to himself as \"President Herman Cain.\" \u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s in more than a few places, including the title of Appendix A, \"The Major Issues of the Day, According to President Herman Cain.\" And President Herman Cain does not like what he sees. Entitlements, he said, are compromising the nation\u2019s financial stability.\n\n\"Current projections indicate that Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017, while Social Security will bottom out by 2037,\" Cain said.\n\nThese figures -- especially the Medicare estimate -- seemed awfully pessimistic. 2017 is only six years away.\n\nWe contacted the Cain campaign and received no response, so we did our own research. We found that FactCheck.org, another fact-checking group, looked at similar statements. Cain\u2019s campaign website also offered some clues. His policy page makes an almost identical claim, citing a May 2009 article in Newsweek as support.\n\nThe op-ed is by columnist Robert J. Samuelson, who argued that Medicare, which provides health care for seniors, and Social Security, which provides retirement income, will have to go bankrupt before lawmakers take funding problems seriously.\n\nSamuelson said current projections show those programs will go bankrupt in 2017 and 2037, the dates when the \"trust funds\" that back them are slated to run dry. Those are the same years Cain cited.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll deal with Cain\u2019s statement that projections show Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017.\n\nFactCheck.org wrote in 2009 about a nearly identical claim made in a TV ad for Americans for Prosperity, where Mark Block, the Cain campaign\u2019s chief operating officer, used to work. It checked another in April by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\nAs FactCheck.org concluded, Medicare does have big financial problems, but there\u2019s no reason to think it\u2019s going out of business.\n\nThere are four parts to Medicare, and they\u2019re funded by two separate trust funds run by the federal government.\n\nPart A covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices. It\u2019s paid for by the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which collects most of its money from federal payroll taxes.\n\nPart B covers doctor visits and other outpatient costs, while Part D covers prescription drugs. The Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund pays their bills, which are mostly covered by the federal government\u2019s general fund and premiums.\n\nMedicare Advantage, or Part C, gives recipients the option to receive care through private insurers. It doesn\u2019t have a trust fund. \u00a0\n\nFactCheck.org\u2019s articles said that the SMI fund is in good shape, and we found it still is. It\u2019s \"projected to remain in financial balance for all future years,\" according to a 2011 report by the fund\u2019s trustees\n\nBut the the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund? Not so much. As of this year, it\u2019s expected to be exhausted by 2024, according to midrange assumptions. If conditions worsen, the trust fund will run out by 2016.\n\nThis is better than the 2009 projections, where trustees expected funds to dry up by 2017, according to midrange assumptions. That\u2019s the same date that Cain used.\n\nStill, as bad as the news is about the hospital insurance fund, FactCheck.org decided it didn\u2019t truly signal bankruptcy. The fund is only a portion of Medicare. The remainder is solvent for the foreseeable future. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Congress has always pulled the hospital insurance fund from the brink of insolvency. According to a Congressional Research Service report, in 1970, the insolvency date was 1972. For the next 16 years, trustees expected its funds to be exhausted by the 1990s. Congress repeatedly changed legislation to lower fund spending and keep it from going dry.\n\nNow, let\u2019s deal with Cain\u2019s claim that Social Security will \"bottom out\" by 2037. \u00a0\n\nThere are two Social Security trust funds: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, which pays for benefits to retired workers, their families and to families of deceased workers; and Disability Insurance, which pays for benefits to disabled workers and their families.\n\nIn 2009, midrange projections by the Social Security Board of Trustees said these trust funds combined will be exhausted in 2037, while the Disability Insurance fund will be gone by 2020. \u00a0The outlook worsened this year. The Disability Insurance fund will be exhausted in 2018. Combined, their assets will be exhausted by 2036.\n\nWhen those funds run dry, Social Security will struggle to pay out benefits as promised, according to trustees. \u00a0\n\nCain\u2019s information was based on a 2009 op-ed. He got that year\u2019s data correct, and projections have not changed dramatically since then.\n\nBut while it\u2019s fair for him to say that Social Security will \"bottom out\" by 2037, saying Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017 is a bit extreme. Only one of Medicare\u2019s funds is expected to be exhausted by that date, and Congress has never let it run dry. Lawmakers have bailed out the fund without fail for 40 years.\n\nSince Cain\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details about the Medicare trust fund, it meets our definition of Half True.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12269"}
