The framework is just that - the amounts of general revenue funding allocated to each budget area. The Senate and the House of Representatives must agree on how to spend that money. However, it was a cause for the celebration of both Hardopolous and Canon, who issued a joint press release. \"A solution to a budget shortfall of about $4 billion is long, but I am glad that the House of Representatives and the Senate worked through this difficult process,\" said Cannon. \"Our allocation ensures that we maintain bond estimates by maintaining adequate reserves. More importantly, we do not take money from Florida's struggling economy by increasing taxes or fees.\" Harrydopolous added: \"As many states and the federal government mess up under a severe spending deficit, we kept our promise that we would not raise taxes or fees during these difficult economic times. For months, I've heard over and over again that we won't be able to do this. In working as a team, the House of Representatives and the Senate have reached budgetary allocations on behalf of all Florida.\" What struck us in the statements is the claim by Hardobolos that state and federal governments \"crash under the spending of the overwhelming deficit.\" We know that the federal government spends more money than it requires, which means it borrows money to keep the government running. However, we wondered whether other countries were in the same financial predicament. Don't make a mistake, the states are in financial trouble. According to the Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities, almost every country proposes less expenditure, adjusted for inflation, than it was in 2008 when the recession began. The Centre, considered pro-democracy, said that at least 25 states had proposed reductions in health care. At least 21 states propose substantial cuts in public education K-12, 20 others propose cuts in higher education, and at least 15 propose the demobilization of government employees and/or the reduction of State employees &apos; benefits. For information, only 48 states are proposing budgets this year. Kentucky and Wyoming work for two years in the budget cycle. But are the states in deficit? Not really, two experts said we asked -- John Shore of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and Ron Snell with the National Congress of State Legislatures. He said that 49 out of 50 states had to go through balanced budgets each year. Shore said, \"The states may borrow for capital improvements and the like, but not for their operational budgets.\" \"Vermont is the exception. It does not have balanced budgetary requirements but has chosen not to borrow for operating expenses.\" Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 On 26 January 2021, Snell added that Illinois and California could submit outstanding invoices for one year, but that they would then be required to repay those debts the following year. However, she is not allowed to carry a disability for several years. \"States have a requirement to balance their operational budgets,\" said Snell, whose group, like Shore, says that Vermont is not only required to pass balanced budgets. Because of the financial crisis, each State had been forced to make cuts, most of which had used reserves, and more than 30 States had created additional revenues either by increasing some fees or taxes. Shore said that Florida only took the cut-off approach. (although he noted that the State had already raised a set of fees in 2009, as well as the rates of education at Florida universities.) Of the $70 billion in the State budget approved last year, $2.2 billion is directed towards paying debt service to capital projects, according to John Kotchwansky, Director of Communications of the State Governing Council. The spokesman for Hardopolous David Bishop said that Hardopolous was trying to notice that many states chose to raise taxes, whereas Florida did not. \"The wording was intended to conclude that States face a severe economic decision (s) and are in deficit when compared to last year's budget (present year). \"Many states like California and Illinois chose to raise taxes.\" Here, in commending Florida &apos; s budget framework 2011-12, Hardopolous said: &quot; While many states and the federal government are floundering under overwhelming deficits, we have kept our promise that we will not raise taxes or fees during these difficult economic times. Perhaps Hardopolous was trying to say that many states raised taxes to balance their budget, but we hold on to his actual words. Vermont is the only state -- either by law or by the Constitution -- that can administer disability budgets such as the federal government. But he was chosen to balance his budget. All other States must adopt balanced budgets. We're assessing the claim of Harridopolous's false. * Updated on April 27, 2011: This story was corrected to describe the Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities as \"democratic transition.\" It has also been updated to include information from the National Congress of State Legislatures.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13189"}
