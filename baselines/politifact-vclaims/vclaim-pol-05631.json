The National Bureau of Economic Research, considered the official arbiter of U.S. recessions, identifies the Great Recession as roughly 18 months, from December 2007 to June 2009.\nThe financial belt-tightening and pain was widespread, hitting families, communities and governments -- including the nation\u2019s counties that collectively employee 3.3 million Americans.\nGeorgia lost 340,400, or 8.5 percent, of its jobs, between 2007 and February 2010 and, consistently \u00a0reported one of the nation\u2019s highest home foreclosure rates in this period.\nGwinnett\u2019s proposed 2016 budget would fund 25 police positions that were frozen and restore staffing at the county animal shelter, correctional facility and parks maintenance.\nIt also would return library funding to 88 percent of its 2008 level and reinstate longevity pay raises that were eliminated in 2009, as well as pay for short-term and long-range needs, Nash said.\nChecking the numbers\nFor our fact-check, we contacted Joe Sorenson, communications director for Gwinnett County government, who provided us with county population and employment data dating back to 2008.\nThe population estimates show Gwinnett, once one of the nation\u2019s fastest growing counties, still steadily adding residents -- going from 780,721 in 2008 to 898,450 this year and forecast to have 919,290 residents in 2016.\nCounty government added 42 \u00a0authorized positions to expand its workforce from 4,893 in 2008 to 4,935 in 2015.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe county would have an authorized workforce of 5,022 under the proposed budget. This includes 30 extra police officers, above and beyond the 25 newly unfrozen jobs, as well as additional positions in the district attorney\u2019s office, animal control and welfare, parks and recreation, water and sewer inspections, and in a medical unit in the county\u2019s Fire & Emergency Services Department. \u00a0\nSo do the numbers we reviewed support Nash\u2019s claim? The short answer is yes.\nThe population estimates the county provided came from a private company and didn\u2019t match exactly those we pulled from the U.S. Census Bureau. But the differences weren\u2019t significant. (For example, the county estimate shows Gwinnett with 880,707 residents in 2014, the Census 877,822. Population estimates for 2015 also aren\u2019t out yet from the Census Bureau.)\nSlow rebound\nElizabeth Kellar, executive director of the Center for State & Local Government Excellence in Washington, D.C., said that, nationwide, local governments -- that includes cities, too -- cut about 500,000 jobs beginning in 2009.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2013 and 2014 that local government human resources managers -- who the center surveys each year -- started reporting the trend turning from hiring freezes and layoffs back to hiring, Kellar said.\nSome county governments in metro Atlanta have smaller staffs today.\nFor example, Fulton County government went from 6,866 permanent and non-permanent employees in 2008 to 5,229 in 2015, spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt said.\nThat\u2019s 1,637 fewer employees for a county that grew by more than 100,000, or about 12 percent in that period.\nDeKalb County didn\u2019t grow on par with Fulton or Gwinnett, but also cut staff.\nBurke Brennan, county spokesman, sent us a graph, plotting filled full-time positions in county government each December from 2007 until this month.\nIt shows the county currently has 6,057 full-time employees,16.3 percent lfewer employees than were on the payroll in 2007.\nCensus Bureau estimates, which Brennan said should be viewed cautiously, show DeKalb\u2019s population grew 5.3 percent, from 685,646 in 2008 to 722,161 in 2014.\nOur\u00a0 ruling\nCharlotte Nash, chairman of the Gwinnett County Commission, said that, since 2008, the population of the county has grown 15 percent while the government staff has increased by only 1 percent.\nThe former county finance director is right on her stats.\nThe budget discussion in Gwinnett also serves a reminder that the Great Recession is not that far back in the rear view mirror -- not when a goal for 2016 is returning library funding to 88 percent of its 2008 funding level.\nWe rate Nash\u2019s statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05631"}
