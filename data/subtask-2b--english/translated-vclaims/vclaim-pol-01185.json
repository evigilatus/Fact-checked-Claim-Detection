At the same time, many Republicans have tried to repeal federal law, known as the Affordable Care Act - a step that would eliminate this guarantee. Is it true that the Democrats in Wisconsin - during a naive and lame session of the state legislature that attracted national attention - turned their backs to protect people through pre-existing protection? On December 5, 2018, as part of the petty session called by Democrats for the seizure of republican power, the Republican-controlled Senate in Wisconsin approved the GOP bill on pre-existing circumstances. Ms. Alberta Darling, a suburban republic of Milwaukee, then issued a press release at the main address that made this attack: \"Democracys turn against pre-existing circumstances.\" Like us on Facebook. We followed Twitter: @Politi FactWisc. The Democrats had the opportunity to turn their election announcements into law. Instead, they turned their backs on the voters in Wisconsin and proved that they were just worried about getting an election,\" he said. All Democrats in the State Senate (along with two Republicans) voted, in fact, against the Republican Bill, which they failed to approve. But to call it foggy (or hypocrisy, as stated by the President of the General Assembly, Robin Voss, who is carrying out a similar attack) is exaggerated and misleading. In an interview, Darling told us that her volatile claim was based on what the Democrats said before the November 2018 elections. She said that they had campaigned by saying that Wisconsin needed to take action to protect people who had pre-existing circumstances in the event that Obama's care was eliminated. Darling claimed that the Democrats had turned on their campaign because the Democrats in the Senate voted against the GOP draft law of circumstances. However, the failure to vote for a specific bill, proposed by the opposition party, does not constitute a major failure. Why Darling's attack is wrong 1. The draft law on the General Statute would have required health insurance companies to cover persons who had lived in previous circumstances. However, it would not have afforded Obama the same protection as care. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, members of the Democratic Senate announced that they had voted against the bill because it would have allowed insurance companies to impose a lifetime ceiling on coverage. They also noted that premiums in the so-called individual market, where people buy health insurance alone, are likely to rise dramatically. The bill \"could have been a step backwards, not a step forward,\" said the state tooth. John Erbenbach, the Democratic Party in Madison. 2. Human rights and fundamental freedoms. 12 - 17 5 The Democrats supported an amendment to the General Statute, which they said would provide more protection than the General Statute for persons who had previously lived in pre-existing conditions. 3 - On the same day as the Republican Bill was approved, the majority of the General Democratic Party in the Senate also approved a bill to support the party &apos; s efforts to overthrow the Obama care system. This measure would prevent the elected Government of Tony Evers and the new Attorney General of Josh Cole, both Democrats, from withdrawing jurisdiction from a federal lawsuit seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act. GOP Gov. Scott Walker signed the legislation into law. As part of this case, the states of Wisconsin and other states sought a preliminary injunction to suspend the Affordable Care Act or, at a minimum, repeal parts of the Act that prohibit health insurance companies from refusing to cover or impose higher rates on persons who already have health conditions. Therefore, Democrats pointed out that while some Republicans and Wisconsin supported the pre-existing draft law on circumstances, others, including GOP Gov. Scott Walker, they were pushing the lawsuit to drop Obama's care and the more comprehensive protection conditions already in place. :: (On 14 December 2018, a federal judge in Texas repealed the Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional.) However, no immediate impact was expected, and the case is likely to be addressed to the United States Supreme Court). As an analysis of the newspaper Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Q. Would state law have protected people with previous circumstances? A. Cooperation with the United Nations Not in the long term, or probably even in the short term. If the Law on Affordable Care is repealed and the State obliges health insurance companies to cover persons with pre-existing health conditions and not to impose higher rates on them, health plans that are sold directly to families and individuals will be more expensive than they are now. This is what happened in New York, which required insurance companies to cover people who had prior circumstances before the Affordable Care Act. What happened in other states also had a similar demand and was eventually forced to abandon it. Our assessment, Darling, declared: \"Democracy deviates from pre-existing conditions,\" noting that all Democrats in the State Senate vote against a Republican bill on pre-existing medical conditions. The Democrats pointed out that the bill would not have afforded the same protection to persons who had previously lived in conditions, and that some health insurance premiums might have increased dramatically. At the same time, they voted to amend the bill, which gave more protection to pre-existing circumstances, but it failed. Furthermore, on the same day that the General Democratic Party Bill was put to a vote, Darling and her Republican colleagues voted in the Senate for a separate bill that would support the party &apos; s efforts to overthrow Obama &apos; s care system - together with protection for persons who had lived in previous circumstances. In short, the voices of Democrats against what they consider to be a lower bill are not failing to protect people who have pre-existing circumstances. We appreciate the false evidence.
