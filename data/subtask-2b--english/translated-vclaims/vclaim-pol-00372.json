The problem is that this current president continues to betray us. Jabbard said about Trump and the organization responsible for the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001. \"But over the years now, not only have we not yet gone to Al-Qaida, which is stronger today than it was on 9/11,\" she said, \"Our President supports Al-Qaida.\" In this fact-finding, we focused on whether Trump did not pursue Al-Qaida and whether he supported it. We found Jabbard wrong either way. (There are indications that Al-Qaida is now stronger than it was on 11 September.) After discussion, Jabbard told Fox that \"the support and alliance of Tramp with Saudi Arabia\" \"provides direct and indirect support\" to Al-Qaida, and that Saudi Arabia \"provides arms and support to Al-Qaida in Yemen.\" When we asked the Jabbard campaign to support its statement, a spokesman made no reference to Yemen, but to Syria. The speaker said that Trump \"protects Al-Qaida in Idlib, Syria, and through its weapons with Saudi Arabia\" is arming Al-Qaida in Syria. Terrorism experts have told us that the United States has repeatedly fought Al-Qaida and that even if it can be proved that some of the weapons sold by the United States to Saudi Arabia end up with Al-Qaida allied groups, the Jabbard attack goes too far, saying that Trump supports the terrorist group. The first part of Jabbard &apos; s allegation was insulting on the day of the discussion when news reports reported that Hamza bin Laden, the son of the Al-Qaida founder, Osama bin Laden, had been killed. At least the operation was supported by the United States, according to The New York Times. Although it is unclear when he was killed, it was during the Trump administration, as officials said. In verifying Jabbard &apos; s statement of discussion, ABC News stated that the United States supported Somali forces against an Al-Qaida associate, and that the United States also carried out drone strikes against Al-Qaida in Yemen. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, the Trump campaign also cited similar examples in the news, including two American air strikes. One in June 2019 was on the al-Qa'idah leadership and training facility in northern Syria where militants were \"planning outside attacks\" against American citizens; and one in December 2018 killed Al-Qaida terrorist who was behind the US Cole bombing. \"Our President supports al-Qa'idah,\" Mr. David Gartenstein-Ross, Chief Executive Officer of the Wallens Global Consulting Company and co-worker at the International Centre against Terrorism, pointed out to us that the United States has already supported al-Qa'idah - but indirectly, not intentionally. During Obama's administration, he said there had been a revolution in Syria, and the United States had given arms to the rebels, but the rebels had become dominated by jihadists, including Al-Qaida. Some of the rebels with whom the United States had worked had turned and given the weapons that the United States had given to Al-Qaida-aligned groups. But the rebel support was stopped under Trump's administration, so Gartenstein Ross did not agree with Jabbard's suggestion that Al Qaeda was beginning to benefit from United States policy towards Syria under Trump. As for the sale of United States arms to Saudi Arabia under Trump's administration, it is likely that some of the weapons ended up with the rebels, as Gartenstein Ross said. That would not be the same as the Trump management that sent weapons to Al-Qaida. Director John Pike made a similar point on how some weapons could end up in Al-Qaida groups. He said: \"There have been some transfers of four degrees of separation, but they run counter to American and Saudi policy.\" \"This part of the world is full of these things, and it will be impossible to track everything.\" While the United States sells weapons to countries believed to supply Islamic rebels in Syria, Jabbard's claim about Trump is \"very exaggerated,\" said the Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University, Jacob Shapiro. The professor of politics and strategy at the University of Carnegie Mellon Colin Clarke went further, telling us that any claim that Trump was deliberately helping Al-Qaida was \"clearly false.\" Our verdict, Jabbard, said that under Trump, \"not only did we not chase the base... our boss supports the base.\" The United States has taken numerous military actions against Al-Qaida during the Trump administration. While some of the weapons sold by the United States to Saudi Arabia may eventually end up with rebel groups in Syria with links to Al-Qaida, the United States has been supporting these rebels since before Trump took office and does not support Al-Qaida arms sales. We're assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00372"}
