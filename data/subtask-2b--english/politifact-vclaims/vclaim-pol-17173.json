Rush Limbaugh\u2019s claim that it \u2018had to be taped\u2019 is wrong", "text": "Former Vice President Joe Biden capped off the virtual Democratic National Convention on Aug. 20 with a nearly 25-minute speech delivered live to a room of reporters, camera crews, campaign staffers and Secret Service agents at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del.\nIn the days since, radio host Rush Limbaugh and other conservative media personalities have falsely claimed that Biden\u2019s speech was pre-taped and edited to remove any mess-ups.\n\"Some people are of the opinion that it had to be taped and that it had to be taped in segments, and the segments had to be edited together because (Biden) is not capable of 22 minutes even reading a prompter with no screw ups,\" Limbaugh said Aug. 21 on his radio show.\u00a0\n\"This is the prevailing theory,\" Limbaugh added, claiming that he knew some \"professional video people\" who were studying the footage for evidence that it had been recorded in advance.\nSimilar claims have spread widely on Twitter and Facebook. The Facebook posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claims are inaccurate. Biden\u2019s speech was carried live by several cable and broadcast TV channels, streamed live by multiple news organizations, and attended live by dozens of people.\n\n\"There were roughly three-dozen reporters, a skeleton camera crew, a handful of Secret Service agents and a smattering of campaign staff,\" ABC News reporter John Verhovek wrote in a report describing what the experience was like for the reporters who were in the room.\nVerhovek described receiving two negative COVID-19 tests and going through a \"security sweep, temperature check and 45-minute wait\" before entering the \"cavernous room\" with \"a massive camera set up pointed directly at a wooden podium.\"\n\nJoe Biden is shown from above as he speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 20, 2020, at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del. (AP)\nSome supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee watched the speech from their cars as it was displayed on a screen in a nearby parking lot.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerhovek tweeted out photos and lines from Biden\u2019s speech as he spoke, as well as a video of Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, interacting with supporters afterward\u00a0through video feeds.\nOther reporters have also tweeted proof that they were inside the venue, including Buzzfeed News\u2019 Ruby Cramer, the Washington Post\u2019s Annie Linskey, the New York Times\u2019 Katie Glueck, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Ken Thomas, the Daily Beast\u2019s Hanna Trudo, CNN\u2019s Sara Mucha, the Atlantic\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere, and CBS News\u2019 Bo Erickson.\nOne widespread tweet making the false claim that Biden pre-recorded his speech came from John Cardillo, a conservative media personality and former New York City police officer.\u00a0\nCardillo shared three photos of Biden. Two were taken during Biden\u2019s speech. The third was snapped later, while Biden and Harris were outside for the fireworks display.\u00a0\nCardillo wrongly claimed that Biden was wearing a pin in the first two photos but not in the third photo, and a wristwatch in the third but not in the first two. He cited that as evidence that Biden\u2019s speech must have been pre-recorded in multiple segments that were later stitched together.\u00a0\nBut the photos Cardillo plucked out were cherry-picked and misleading. The same argument \u2014 and photos \u2014 formed the basis of similarly inaccurate claims on Facebook.\nVideo footage of Biden outside with Harris for the fireworks shows him wearing the very same pin that Cardillo claimed had disappeared from his suit. And the watch, which was clearly visible when Biden and Harris joined arms outside and raised them, was likely hidden beneath Biden\u2019s sleeve for most of the speech, when his arms weren\u2019t outstretched in the same way.\nAt one point during the speech, the watch on Biden\u2019s wrist could briefly be seen glimmering under his sleeve. It was also visible for a moment after the speech as Biden, Harris and their spouses waved to supporters shown on a video wall behind the podium.\u00a0\nBetween the speech, the interaction with supporters on screen, and the walk outside for the display of fireworks, Biden\u2019s outfit never changed. (He did put on a mask before going outside.)\nLimbaugh did not respond to a request for comment.\nOur ruling\nLimbaugh said Biden\u2019s convention speech \"had to be taped in segments, and the segments had to be edited together.\"\nThe nearly 25-minute speech was continuous. It was carried live on TV stations, streamed live online and delivered live for a room of reporters, camera crews, campaign staffers and Secret Service agents in Wilmington. Multiple reporters shared photos from inside the venue.\nWe rate Limbaugh\u2019s claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17173"}
