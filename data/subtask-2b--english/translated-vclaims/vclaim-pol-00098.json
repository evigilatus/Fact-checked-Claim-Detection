In a follow-up tweet, Jones, who described herself on Twitter as associated with the Trump Campaign Advisory Council, sent her followers a lead on Kora, a question-and-answer site, on whether the results of the presidential election could be cancelled. But isolation doesn't work that way. The twenty-second amendment of the Constitution prohibits the election of presidents more than twice. The amendment reads as follows: \"No one shall be elected to the office of President more than twice, and no one shall be elected to the office of President, or assume the functions of President, for more than two years of the term for which another person has been elected President, more than once.\" The Constitution provides the basis for the process of isolation. The Council has the sole power of isolation, while the Senate retains the sole power to experience all dismissals. When a President is tried in the Senate, the Constitution provides that \"the Chief Justice shall serve as President\" and requires two thirds of the votes to be cast to convict the President and remove him from office. The specific parameters of the process of isolation have evolved over time, as we have noted in our in-depth analysis of what the investigation of the process of isolation against Trump might look like. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2021, Bill McCarthy, but the Constitution says nothing about \"the nullification\" of the President's mandate by a failed attempt at deportation. If that were to happen, former President Bill Clinton - who was sentenced in the House of Representatives but acquitted by the Senate - would have put forward the idea of running for a third term. \"This is ridiculous,\" said Louis Sedman, Professor of Constitutional Law in Georgetown Law, about Jones' claim. \"There's no truth in that at all.\" Frank O. Bowman III, Professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Missouri and author of a book on isolation, added that it was \"absolute garbage.\" \"By the twenty-second amendment, the Presidents shall receive two terms, one period (with special exception if someone joins the office during the term of another President, but works less than two years from that term), \" Bowman wrote in an e-mail to Politifact. \"Not in Trump.\" Jones did not respond to the request for comment. Our rule, Jones, said, \"If isolation reaches home and moves to the Senate and is not passed, the first sentence has been revoked and Trump can run two more periods.\" The Constitution expressly prohibits the election of presidents for more than two terms.
