He observed the protest and raised his phone to snap some photos of the group. ABQ Raw filmed the video in beautiful 4K. The driver of the red truck had a striking resemblance to the recently deceased Jeffrey Epstein. Did Jeffrey Epstein kill himself? It may be completely possible that he has ridden off in the New Mexico sunset.\"\u00a0\nThe video ends with a clip of the truck driving away.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

On multiple occasions, according to the New York Times, Epstein talked to scientists and businessmen about his hopes to use the ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and give birth to his babies.\u00a0\nEpstein \u2014 a multimillionaire, not billionaire, as the Facebook video says \u2014 died in jail, where he was being held on charges of child sex trafficking. The New York City medical examiner and U.S. Attorney General William Barr have both said Epstein died of suicide but conspiracy theories about his death persist. President Donald Trump, among others, have suggested that Epstein was killed in custody.\nBut we found nothing to corroborate the claim in this Facebook video.\u00a0\nIn August 2019, we fact-checked and rated Pants on Fire a claim that Epstein isn\u2019t dead. Back then, the medical examiner had yet to release his final ruling on how Epstein died, but numerous people in official positions confirmed that he was, in fact, dead.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Prisons announced his death. One of Epstein\u2019s lawyers blamed prosecutors and the Manhattan Correctional Center, where Epstein was held, for his client\u2019s death. And federal prosecutors then said that their investigation of those suspected of helping Epstein would continue despite his death.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook video Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18676"}
