Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., citing costs as well as other factors.\nBut does that mean Biden, if elected president, would resist such a bill if it were handed to him by Congress?\u00a0\nOne user on Twitter overinterpreted Biden\u2019s response to this scenario during a March 9 interview with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell. The tweet was crossposted onto Facebook and shared among several Sanders-aligned groups.\u00a0\n\"Joe Biden just told @Lawrence that as president he would veto Medicare for All if it passed both houses and came to his desk,\" stated the post.\nBiden\u2019s actual answer raised a lot of doubts about the hypothetical situation but wasn\u2019t quite that plain.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

He manages to get Medicare for All through the Senate in some compromise version, the Elizabeth Warren version or other version. Nancy Pelosi gets a version of it through the House of Representatives. It comes to your desk. Do you veto it?\"\n\"I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now,\" Biden said.\n\"If they got that through by some miracle, there was an epiphany that occurred, and some miracle occurred that said okay, it passed, then you got to look at the costs. I want to know, how do they find the $35 trillion? What is that doing? Is it going to significantly raise taxes on the middle class, which it will. What\u2019s going to happen?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe went on to explain his current position against the legislation.\n\"Look, my opposition isn\u2019t to the principle that you should have Medicare. Health care should be a right in America. My opposition relates to whether or not a) it\u2019s doable, 2) what the cost is and what consequences for the rest of budget are. How are you going to find $35 trillion over the next 10 years without having profound impacts on everything from taxes for middle class and working class people as well as the impact on the rest of the budget?\"\nSome media outlets concluded that Biden\u2019s statements mean he would veto Medicare for All. In context, Biden said he would veto \"anything\" that made health care less secure and certain as he dismissed the likelihood of the bill getting passed. He emphasized his questions about the cost of the current proposal.\nThe Biden campaign had no comment.\nOur ruling\nA viral tweet said, \"Joe Biden just told @Lawrence that as president he would veto Medicare for All if it passed both houses and came to his desk.\"\nBiden\u2019s response on MSNBC was not as definitive as the post made it seem.\nBiden replied that he \"would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now.\" He said if it passed, he would want to look at the costs and the impact on the budget and taxes for the middle class.\nTo put it another way, Biden only had critical words when asked about Medicare for All, but he didn\u2019t bluntly state he would veto it.\nThe statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.
