Not even close.", "text": "(Joff) The announcement by Tony Evers that he would press for the decriminalization of marijuana in Wisconsin was one of the biggest sprayings in his young term. It attracted media coverage from all over the country and triggered a war of news bulletins on the front line. On February 18, 2019, Evers said that his first budget would include proposals to legitimize medical marijuana; allow for the possession of small quantities of marijuana for personal use; and expand the capacity to cancel some drug convictions. News releases announced the transmission of medical benefits from marijuana, then focused on making the cause of social justice change. \"The reform of marijuana laws in Wisconsin to conform to the people's medical support for marijuana is an important part of the Governor's plan,\" said the release. \"But this also addresses the social and ethnic justice aspect of marijuana abuse. Wisconsin has the highest prison rate in the country for black men, and drug-related crimes account for as much as 75-85 per cent of all prisoners in our prisons.\" Evers surveyed the same census 75 to 85 per cent in a tweet that was deleted that day. This was repeated in the text of NBC News on the Evers Declaration. That's too many. In view of all possible actions that could put a person in prison, did drug offences really constitute three quarters or more of all prisoners? Many ways to track drug crime - but none of the top 30% uses a number of measures by the Wisconsin Correctional Service to track how prisoners fall behind bars. But none of them are close to Evers' number. An analysis conducted in February 2017 of the prison entry point showed that 27 per cent of prisoners had been sent to prison for drug offences in 2016. This includes opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and marijuana. The crimes of marijuana accounted for 6.4 per cent of the prison admissions. At the same time, a time analysis conducted by the Section showed that 22 per cent of the population in Wisconsin had been subjected to a drug offence in 2017 - which means that this was among the crimes they had committed in prison. The number of prisoners is even lower when examining the most serious crimes to which each prisoner is subjected - the most likely in terms of their length of imprisonment. Only 11% of prisoners in 2017 had a drug crime as their most serious charge. In comparison, the crime of violence was the most serious charge of 66 per cent of the offenders and the crime of property for 14 per cent. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 January 15, 2012, where did Evers get his number? When we asked the Evers office for the evidence underlying the drug crime allegation, Deputy Chief of Staff Melissa Baldav said that they had made a mistake. Since then, Evers employees have removed statistics from the electronic version of the news release advertising the marijuana proposal submitted by Evers. Relevant: United States, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, announces the relevant marijuana search case: US, Sen. Tammy Baldwin's claim that VA doctors are 'observers' from talking about the conspiracy's missing vessel. The WUWM is the National Public Broadcasting Authority of Milwaukee. Ellwanger used statistics in the context of a study by the University of Wisconsin-Milwake which found that Wisconsin had the highest prison rates in the country for the black population. But he was wrong. \"After further investigation, the prosecution, as mentioned in the article WUWM above, did not appear to have sufficient evidence, and should have been deleted from our document,\" said the Duff in an e-mail. \"So, the honest answer is that the employees made a mistake. We have since updated our online press release to remove those statistics and note the error.\" The Evers tweet, which refers to statistics as evidence of the need to decriminalize marijuana, collected more than 500 rewrites before being deleted a few days later. Our evaluation (Evers) claimed in a news release that drug-related crime represented 75 to 85% of Wisconsin's population. These statistics were withdrawn from an incorrect article published six years ago. Current data from the Ministry of the Interior show that the actual number of inmates sentenced to drug offences is a small part of that number - about a quarter of the prison population. In fact, the figures do not yet exist, and the sources - a six-year-old article based on a radio interview focused on a different subject - are very far away, which is ridiculous. We're assessing the allegation of pants on fire.
