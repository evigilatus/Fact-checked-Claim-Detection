With a little reporting, we found that four Georgia residents are challenging Obama\u2019s eligibility for the state presidential preference primary and general election ballots.\n\nThey\u2019re saying Obama isn\u2019t a natural-born citizen, which would mean that under the Constitution, he\u2019s not eligible to be president. Critics of this line of thought call some of these people \"birthers,\" a term these challengers by and large reject.\n\nDavid Farrar of Cedartown in west Georgia thinks Obama\u2019s biggest problem is that there needs to be proof in addition to the president\u2019s birth certificate confirming he was born in the U.S.\n\nKevin Powell of Duluth, Carl Swensson of Morrow and David Welden of Powder Springs think that Obama does not meet the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen. Powell and Swensson say they can cite U.S. Supreme Court precedent to prove it.\n\nA fifth challenger rescinded his complaint, said Kim Beal, a staff attorney with the Office of State Administrative Hearings, which is handling the challenges. A hearing is set for Jan. 26.\n\n\"Man up,\" Swensson\u2019s challenge told Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Kemp\u2018s office administers the state\u2019s elections.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia has addressed such arguments before, and they didn\u2019t do well on the Truth-O-Meter. The claims about Obama\u2019s birth certificate range from False to Pants on Fire. PolitiFact Georgia also found problems with an argument that Obama does not meet the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen.\n\nBut these theories aren\u2019t the focus of this inquiry. We\u2019re trying to figure out whether Democrats are right that Republicans are trying to knock Obama off the ballot.\n\nObviously, these concerned citizens all want him gone. But are they Republicans? And is this a GOP-sanctioned effort? \u00a0\n\nWe looked into the challengers\u2019 Republican bona fides.\n\nThey emphasized that the Republican Party is not coordinating their efforts. Swensson told \u00a0PolitiFact Georgia that he reached out to the party for its support and got none.\n\n\"Basically, what I get from them is crickets,\" Swensson said. \"Lots and lots of crickets.\"\n\nGeorgia Republican Party Chairwoman Sue Everhart distanced the state party from the challenges.\n\n\"The Georgia Republican Party is not a party to any of those challenges, and had no knowledge of them before they were filed,\" Everhart said in a statement released by a party spokesman.\n\nThe challengers all said their efforts have nothing to do with their party affiliations.\n\n\"It\u2019s an entirely nonpartisan effort. It has nothing to do with politics, only to do with the Constitution,\" said Welden, who said he has voted Republican but leans independent. \u00a0\n\nThat said, challenges do have significant GOP ties.\n\nState Rep. Mark Hatfield, a Republican attorney from Waycross, represents Powell and Swensson in their challenge. He is vice chairman of the state House\u2019s Judiciary Non-Civil Committee and is listed as the Republicans\u2019 deputy majority whip.\n\nLast year, Hatfield sponsored legislation that would make presidential and vice presidential candidates prove their citizenship to make the state\u2019s ballot.\n\nSwensson is chairman of the Clayton County Republican Party.\n\nTennessee lawyer Van Irion represents Welden. He ran for Congress in 2010 and won the backing of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. Irion lost in the Republican primary.\n\nOrly Taitz, a California lawyer, represents Farrar. She ran unsuccessfully in 2010 to be the Republican nominee for California secretary of state.\n\nFarrar told PolitiFact Georgia he considers himself a Republican. Voter records show Powell voted in six Georgia primaries between 1996 and 2008 and chose a Republican ballot in all of them. \u00a0\n\nHow do we rule?\n\nThere are efforts to \"remove Barack Obama from Georgia\u2019s Presidential Ballot in 2012,\" as Democrats said.\n\nWhether \"Republicans\" are trying to do this is a dicier issue. The Georgia Democrats\u2019 language could lead a reasonable person to think that the effort is organized by the GOP.\n\nIt\u2019s not. Nevertheless, these challenges are dyed bright red. A GOP state representative does represent two of the challengers, and two unsuccessful Republican candidates from Tennessee and California represent the rest.\n\nOne challenger is chairman of his county GOP. Three of the four challengers consider themselves Republicans, and all of them have voted Republican.\n\nBecause the state party is not involved in the challenge, but individual Republicans are leading the charge, we rate the Georgia Democrats\u2019 statement Half True.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11778"}
