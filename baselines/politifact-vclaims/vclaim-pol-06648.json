Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to say the economy is bouncing back from the recession.\nOn NBC\u2019s Meet the Press March 8, host Chuck Todd noted that unemployment is at its lowest since May 2008. And in 2014, unemployment went down in every state \u2014 a first since 1984. Todd asked Graham if Republicans \u2014 who have criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s economic policies \u2014 could admit that some progress has been made.\n\"I think that we do have stagnant middle-class wage growth, and I think the labor participation rate is at an all-time low,\" Graham said. \"So if your argument is that we\u2019re on the road to recovery, we had a sound economy under President Obama, no I don\u2019t agree with that at all.\"\nPointing out that the labor participation rate has been on the decline is a typical retort among Republicans\u00a0in response to arguments that the unemployment rate is shrinking. While low unemployment rate is generally a good thing, economists also say you want a high labor participation rate. That\u2019s because the higher the rate, the more members of the working-age population that are actively seeking employment.\nBut is today\u2019s labor participation rate at an \"all-time low\"? Not so.\nAs of February, the labor participation rate is 62.8 percent, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nRates were consistently lower than what they are today from 1948 through 1978 \u2014 with the lowest point at 58.1 percent in December 1954. (Available data goes back to 1948.)\nBelow is a graph showing the trend since 1950:\n\nIn fairness to Graham, today\u2019s labor participation rate is essentially the lowest it\u2019s been since 1978. The rate increased steadily from the mid 1960s through the late 1990s, when it hit a peak of 67 percent. Since Obama has been in office, the rate has dropped 2.9 percentage points.\nMuch of the increase in the labor participation rate in the second half of the 20th century largely has to do with a massive increase in the number of women seeking employment as a result of changes such as better access to contraceptives and anti-gender discrimination legislation, according to an economic report out of the White House, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThis major social difference in the country\u2019s workforce makes it difficult to compare labor participation rates today to those 50 years ago.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother important reason for labor participation rate increase through the 1990s was the fact that baby boomers reached their \"peak working years,\" according to the report.\nFactors contributing to current decline are up for debate.\nOn the one hand, there\u2019s concern that people are discouraged about their job prospects. The slow recovery from the recent recession may have prompted people to go back to school, stay at home with their kids or give up on a job search altogether.\nBut absent the recession, labor participation would have dropped anyway, Brookings economist Gary Burtless told PolitiFact in 2013. Why? Because the baby boomers have started to retire.\nAnd as the population gets older, fewer people will be working overall, meaning the labor participation rate will continue to decline in the coming decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAdditionally the rate of female labor participation \u2014 which increased rapidly through the 1990s \u2014\u00a0has since plateaued and declined slightly. (The labor participation rate among men has decreased more.) \u00a0\nThe White House report found that half the decline in labor participation is a result of the aging population, while the other half is a combination of cyclical economic trends, the recession\u00a0and existing trends such as the decline of female workers.\nThe report also notes that while labor force participation among young adults has declined about 0.8 percentage points a year since 2007, school and college enrollment has increased. So the rate of young adults either working or in school has remained relatively unchanged.\nOur ruling\nGraham said, \"The labor participation rate is at an all-time low.\" \u00a0Graham\u2019s office did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment.\nThe rate was lower than it is today from 1948 to 1978. That said, it's not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison and the labor participation is at about its lowest level in 37\u00a0years.\u00a0\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
