Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2018\n\n\nThe White House did not respond to PolitiFact queries for data backing Trump\u2019s claim.\nIt\u2019s difficult to pin a hard number on the cost of illegal immigration, because there\u2019s limited\u00a0data on the population living in the United States illegally. But several immigration experts told PolitiFact they were unaware of any study pegging immigration losses or costs at $250 billion a year. The largest estimate we could find is not even half of Trump\u2019s assertion.\nIt\u2019s entirely unclear where Trump\u2019s estimate comes from\nTrump has previously touched on the country\u2019s fiscal burden from illegal immigration. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he claimed that \"illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year.\" That was Mostly False.\nHis latest claim more than doubles the figures he claimed two years ago;\u00a0most estimates of the unauthorized population remain around 11 million.\nThe right-leaning Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) estimated in a September 2017 report that the federal, state and local costs of more than 12.5 million people in the United States illegally was around $135 billion a year. After factoring in this population\u2019s tax contributions, the group said the total economic impact of illegal immigration was around $116 billion a year (up from $113 billion in 2013).\nThe federation seeks to reduce legal and illegal immigration to the United States, and its cost estimates tend to be higher than other related studies. Its conclusions have generally been criticized for relying on inexact estimates and broad assumptions.\nAlex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said FAIR\u2019s 2017 report was \"fatally flawed.\" It undercounted immigrants\u2019 tax revenues, inflated the number of immigrants in the country illegally, counted millions of U.S. citizens as illegally in the United States, and used a method of estimating fiscal costs \"that is rejected by all economists who work on this subject,\" he said.\nWithout precise data on the unauthorized immigrant population, researchers typically draw inferences about characteristics based on responses to surveys that don\u2019t ask about authorization status.\nWhy illegal immigration savings wouldn\u2019t cover wall\u2019s cost \"in two months\"\nTrump claimed that a $25 billion border wall would pay itself in two months, under a scenario where illegal immigration costs $250 billion a year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are obvious problems with the numbers. And overall, the total cost of a complete border wall is unclear. But the real problem is the comparison of one-time construction costs of a border wall to annual costs of net government benefits paid in excess of taxes received.\n\"Building a wall doesn\u2019t magically remove unauthorized immigrants already in the country,\"\u00a0said Ryan D. Edwards, a research associate at the Berkeley Population Center and a curriculum coordinator in UC Berkeley's Division of Data Sciences, in an\u00a0email. \"Only deportations do.\"\nTrump's claim also overlooks the complexities of congressional appropriations and the reasons why many Democrats are hesitant to fund the wall. Democrats say the wall is too costly. They also say\u00a0there are other ways to secure the border, including the use of technology surveillance and more border patrol agents.\nA February 2017 study from the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels, analyzed data from the National Academies\u00a0of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The study considered data related to the likely education level of future immigrants crossing the border illegally and their estimated fiscal impact.\n\"If a border wall prevented 160,000 to 200,000 illegal crossings (excluding descendants) in the next 10 years, it would be enough to pay for the estimated $12 to $15 billion costs of the wall,\" the analysis said.\nThe projected savings are based on an average lifetime fiscal burden of almost $75,000 for someone who crossed illegally, but not their U.S.-born children.\nSome caveats noted by the analysis:\n\u2022 The population of immigrants in the United States illegally includes people who overstay a visa; and a southern border wall would not address this issue.\n\u2022 A large share of the net fiscal costs of illegal immigration is at the state and local levels, yet building a border wall would be a federal cost.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that some of the federal costs included in some estimates for illegal immigration include expenditures tied to education and health care \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s uncertain whether those specifics funds would be diverted to pay for the border wall.\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted, \"Our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months.\"\nThe White House did not provide data or any other information backing Trump\u2019s assessment. Several economics and immigration experts said they were unaware of any report stating that $250 billion figure. It\u2019s difficult to peg an exact cost of illegal immigration, but even high estimates are significantly lower.\nTrump\u2019s claim that a $25 billion border wall would pay for itself in two months isn\u2019t supported by the facts, either.\nTrump\u2019s claim is inaccurate.
