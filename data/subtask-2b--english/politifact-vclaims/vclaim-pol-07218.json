Money magazine said it was the fifth best city to live in in America. In addition to that, All Cities Almanac said in 1994, I believe, that it was the safest city in America.\"\nWhile such ratings are notable mostly for their public relations value, it\u2019s still quite a collection of accolades for Rhode Island\u2019s capital. We decided to check if they were all true.\nLet\u2019s go down the list, starting with USA Today. We found a 1996 story from The Journal on USA Today\u2019s selection of Providence as one of America\u2019s \"renaissance cities.\" \u00a0The Dec. 31, 1996, edition of USA Today profiled Providence as part of a series on cities that had revitalized themselves through \"bold and creative approaches,\" according to The Journal story.\nThe USA Today story chronicled the city\u2019s efforts to preserve its historic landmarks and launch new development initiatives, including the creation of Waterplace Park. The newspaper credited Cianci for Providence\u2019s renewal, according to The Journal.\nWhat about Money Magazine and its annual list of the best places to live in America? In 2000, Portland, Ore., was rated the best in the nation, but Providence was one of four regional winners, according to The Journal. The city was named best place to live in the East.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Cianci wasn\u2019t always happy with Money\u2019s \"best places to live\" list. After Providence was ranked a lowly 136th out of 300 cities in 1995, Cianci complained in an Op-Ed in The Journal that Money \"failed to take into account Providence's resurgence, renewal, ambiance and amenities.\" (Providence dropped to 198th on the list in 1996 and 240th in 1997. The format for the rankings subsequently changed.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

This is based on a 1994 story in Parade magazine, according to a Journal story from that year. For the Parade story, John Tepper Marlin, author of the 1992 book \"The Livable Cities Almanac,\" looked at statistics for murder rates, robberies, auto fatalities, overall death rates, air pollution and infant mortality rates.\nHe concluded that Honolulu, Hawaii, was number one and that Providence was number two -- or safest in the continental United States.\nAt the time, critics of the survey pointed out that it looked at only a limited number of factors, not all crime-related. But Cianci was undeterred.\n\"This is really and truly something we as a community can be proud of, and we can brag about it,\" Cianci said at the time.\nAnd he still is.\nOur ruling\nIn the debate with Democrat Jorge Elorza and Republican Daniel Harrop, Cianci said that Providence was described as a renaissance city during his most recent stint in office and that it was also rated the safest city in America and one of the best places to live.\nThe details are a bit off on a couple of those claims -- where they were made, the actual ranking -- but Cianci is pretty much on the mark.\nWe rate his statement True.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07218"}
