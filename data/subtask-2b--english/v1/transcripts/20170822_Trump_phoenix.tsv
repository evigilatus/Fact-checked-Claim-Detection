0014	Donald Trump	It is incredible.
0015	Donald Trump	It is incredible.
0016	Donald Trump	As everybody here remembers, this was the scene of my first rally speech, right?
0017	Donald Trump	The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight, that the people said right at the beginning, you know, there's something special happening here.
0018	Donald Trump	And we went to center stage almost from day one in the debates.
0019	Donald Trump	We love those debates.
0020	Donald Trump	But we went to center stage and we never left, right?
0021	Donald Trump	All of us, we did it together.
0022	Donald Trump	You were there at the start.
0023	Donald Trump	You've been there every single day since, and I will never forget.
0024	Donald Trump	Believe me, Arizona, I will never forget.
0025	Donald Trump	And I'm here tonight to send a message We are fully and totally committed to fighting for our agenda, and we will not stop until the job is done.

0037	Donald Trump	And we pledge our allegiance to one nation under God.

0039	Donald Trump	Our movement is a movement built on love.
0040	Donald Trump	It's love for fellow citizens.
0041	Donald Trump	It's love for struggling Americans who've been left behind, and love for every American child who deserves a chance to have all of their dreams come true.
0042	Donald Trump	From the inner cities to the rural outposts, from the Sun Belt to the Rust Belt, from east to west and north to south, our movement is built on the conviction that every American from every background is entitled to a government that puts their needs first.
0043	Donald Trump	It is finally time to rebuild our country, to take care of our people, and to fight for the jobs our great American workers deserve, and that's what we're doing.
0044	SYSTEM	[Crowd chants USA]
0045	Donald Trump	After our amazing election victory, the forgotten men and women  remember we used to talk about the forgotten men and women before the election?
0046	Donald Trump	Guess what?
0047	Donald Trump	They're not forgotten... anymore, right?
0048	Donald Trump	Anymore.
0049	Donald Trump	No, they're not forgotten anymore folks.
0050	Donald Trump	In fact, they're trying to figure you out.
0051	Donald Trump	They're saying the obstructionists, how do we get them to vote for us?
0052	Donald Trump	I don't think that's going to happen any time soon.
0053	Donald Trump	We believe that every American has the right to live with dignity.
0054	Donald Trump	Respect for America demands respect for all of its people.
0055	Donald Trump	Loyalty to our nation requires loyalty to each other, We all share the same home, the same dreams and the same hopes for a better future.
0056	Donald Trump	A wound inflicted upon one member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all.
0057	Donald Trump	You saw last night.
0058	Donald Trump	You saw last night.
0059	Donald Trump	Did anybody watch last night?
0060	Donald Trump	Yes.
0061	Donald Trump	When one part of America hurts, we all hurt.
0062	Donald Trump	And when one American suffers an injustice, all of America suffers together.
0063	Donald Trump	We're all together.
0064	Donald Trump	It's time for us to follow the example of our brave American soldiers.
0065	Donald Trump	And I was with a lot of them last night, Fort Myers.
0066	Donald Trump	No matter where they come from, no matter what faith they practice, they form a single unbreakable team.
0067	Donald Trump	That's what we are.
0068	Donald Trump	We're a team.
0069	Donald Trump	As a nation, we're a team.
0070	Donald Trump	They're all united by their devotion to our country and to their mission.
0071	Donald Trump	It's time for all of us to remember that we are all on the same team.
0072	Donald Trump	We are all Americans, and we all believe right now in America first.
0073	Donald Trump	And it's happening, and it's happening fast.
0074	Donald Trump	I see all those red hats and white hats.
0075	Donald Trump	It's all happening very fast.
0076	Donald Trump	It's called "Make America Great Again."
0077	Donald Trump	You see what's going on.
0078	Donald Trump	It's coming back, very fast.
0079	Donald Trump	We want every child to succeed, every community to prosper and every struggling American to have a chance for a better life.
0080	Donald Trump	What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America.
0081	Donald Trump	And tonight, this entire arena stands united in forceful condemnation of the thugs who perpetrate hatred and violence.
0082	Donald Trump	But the very dishonest media, those people right up there with all the cameras.
0083	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0084	Donald Trump	So the  and I mean truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media, they make up stories.
0085	Donald Trump	They have no sources in many cases.
0086	Donald Trump	They say "a source says"  there is no such thing.
0087	Donald Trump	But they don't report the facts.
0088	Donald Trump	Just like they don't want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry and violence and strongly condemned the neoNazis, the White Supremacists, and the KKK.
0089	Donald Trump	I openly called for unity, healing and love, and they know it because they were all there.
0090	Donald Trump	So what I did  So what I did is I thought, I'd take just a second, and I'm really doing this more than anything else, because you know where my heart is, OK?
0091	Donald Trump	I'm really doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are.
0092	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0093	Donald Trump	So here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville  and I have a home in Charlottesville, a lot of people don't know.
0094	Donald Trump	Here's the first  can't believe they haven't figured that one out yet.
0095	Donald Trump	Now they know.
0096	Donald Trump	Now they finally know.
0097	Donald Trump	But I  I just  I don't want to bore you with this, but I  it shows you how dishonest they are.
0098	Donald Trump	And most of you know this anyway.
0099	Donald Trump	So here's what I said, really fast, here's what I said on Saturday "We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia"  this is me speaking.
0100	Donald Trump	We condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence."
0101	Donald Trump	That's me speaking on Saturday.
0102	Donald Trump	Right after the event.
0103	Donald Trump	So I'm condemning the strongest, possible terms, "egregious display," "hatred, bigotry and violence."
0104	Donald Trump	OK, I think I can't do much better, right?
0105	Donald Trump	OK.
0106	Donald Trump	But they didn't want to put this on.
0107	Donald Trump	They had it on initially, but then one day he talked  he didn't say it fast enough.
0108	Donald Trump	He didn't do it on time.
0109	Donald Trump	Why did it take a day?
0110	Donald Trump	He must be a racist.
0111	Donald Trump	It took a day.
0112	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0113	Donald Trump	Dishonest people.
0114	Donald Trump	So here is  here is me  I hope they're showing how many people are in this room, but they won't.
0115	Donald Trump	They don't even do that.
0116	Donald Trump	The only time they show the crowds is when there's a disrupter or an anarchist in the room.
0117	Donald Trump	I call them anarchists.
0118	Donald Trump	Because, believe me, we have plenty of anarchists.
0119	Donald Trump	They don't want to talk about the anarchists.
0120	Donald Trump	So this is me  "it has no place in America."
0121	Donald Trump	I'm talking about hatred, bigotry and violence.
0122	Donald Trump	It has no place in America.
0123	Donald Trump	What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.
0124	Donald Trump	No citizen should ever fear for their safety, security in our society, and no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play or be with their parents and have a good time.
0125	Donald Trump	This is me speaking.
0126	Donald Trump	Here's further.
0127	Donald Trump	This is on Saturday, the first one.
0128	Donald Trump	I did this three times.
0129	Donald Trump	We have to come together as Americans with love for the nation and true affection, really  and I say this so strongly  "true affection for each other."
0130	Donald Trump	I didn't say true affection for you and you.
0131	Donald Trump	I said for each other, all of us.
0132	Donald Trump	All of us.
0133	Donald Trump	All of us.
0134	Donald Trump	But they don't report it.
0135	Donald Trump	They don't  they just let it go.
0136	Donald Trump	Above all else, we must remember this truth, no matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are all Americans first.
0137	Donald Trump	We love our country, we love our God, and we love our flag.
0138	SYSTEM	[Crowd chants USA]
0139	Donald Trump	And then I went on, this is my first statement, and they said, remember they said, well, he wasn't specific enough.
0140	Donald Trump	Why wasn't he more specific?
0141	Donald Trump	So in my second statement, I got really specific, and they said, why didn't he do it faster?
0142	Donald Trump	The  I'm telling you folks, look, look, I know these people probably better than anybody.
0143	Donald Trump	And a lot of people have a problem with it, because look, what happens with them, if they're doing a story about me, I know if it's honest or false.
0144	Donald Trump	If you're reading a story about somebody, you don't know.
0145	Donald Trump	You assume it's honest, because it's like the failing New York Times, which is like so bad.
0146	Donald Trump	It's so bad.
0147	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0148	Donald Trump	Or the Washington Post, which call a lobbying tool for Amazon, OK, that's a lobbying tool for Amazon.
0149	Donald Trump	Or CNN, which is so bad and so pathetic, and their ratings are going down.
0150	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0151	Donald Trump	Right?
0152	SYSTEM	[Crowd chants CNN Sucks]
0153	Donald Trump	But all the networks  I mean, CNN is really bad, but ABC this morning  I don't watch it much, but I'm watching in the morning, and they have little George Stephanopoulos talking to Nikki Haley, right?
0154	Donald Trump	Little George.
0155	Donald Trump	And  and he talks about the speech I made last night, which believe it or not, got great reviews, right?
0156	Donald Trump	They had a hard time.
0157	Donald Trump	They were having a hard time because it was with soldiers, we were somber, we were truthful, we were doing  we were saying things  and it really did.
0158	Donald Trump	So, he talked about it for like that much, then he goes, "Let's get back to Charlottesville."
0159	Donald Trump	Charlottesville.
0160	Donald Trump	And Nikki was great.
0161	Donald Trump	She's doing a great job, by the way.
0162	Donald Trump	So now, I say we have to heal our wounds and the wounds of our country.
0163	Donald Trump	I love the people of our country, the people, all of the people.
0164	Donald Trump	It says I love all of the people of our country.
0165	Donald Trump	I didn't say I love you because you're black, or I love you because you're white, or I love you because you're from Japan, or you're from China, or you're from Kenya, or you're from Scotland or Sweden.
0166	Donald Trump	I love all the people of our country.
0167	Donald Trump	So, I said here's my  this is  by the way folks, this is my exact words "I love all the people of our country.
0168	Donald Trump	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make it great for all of the people of the United States of America."
0169	Donald Trump	And then they say, is he a racist?
0170	Donald Trump	Is he a racist?
0171	Donald Trump	Then, I did a second one.
0172	Donald Trump	So then I did a second one.
0173	Donald Trump	Don't bother, it's only a single voice.
0174	Donald Trump	And not a very powerful voice.
0175	Donald Trump	How did he get in here?
0176	Donald Trump	He's supposed to be with the few people outside.
0177	Donald Trump	How about  how about all week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside.
0178	Donald Trump	Where are they?
0179	Donald Trump	Well, it's hot out.
0180	Donald Trump	It is hot.
0181	Donald Trump	I think it's too warm.
0182	Donald Trump	You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they've got clubs and they've got everything  Antifa!
0183	Donald Trump	So on August the 14th  so that was it, and I said all people, I love all people, everything, right?
0184	Donald Trump	Now I figure I'm going to do it again.
0185	Donald Trump	I'll be even more specific.
0186	Donald Trump	So I said, based on the events that took place over the last weekend in Charlottesville, I'd like to provide the nation with an update.
0187	Donald Trump	Because that was right after the event, the first one, right?
0188	Donald Trump	An update on ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everybody.
0189	Donald Trump	To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable, justice will be delivered.
0190	Donald Trump	That's what I said.
0191	Donald Trump	Listen to that, I said that, but they don't show that.
0192	Donald Trump	They don't show it.
0193	Donald Trump	They take  they'll take one thing, like, seriously, he was late was the best thing.
0194	Donald Trump	He was late.
0195	Donald Trump	So I said, to anyone who acted criminally in this weekends racists violence.
0196	Donald Trump	OK, then I go, we must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence.
0197	Donald Trump	We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans, right?
0198	Donald Trump	Then I said, racism is evil.
0199	Donald Trump	Do they report that I said that racism is evil?
0200	Donald Trump	You know why?
0201	Donald Trump	Because they are very dishonest people.
0202	Donald Trump	So I said, racism is evil.
0203	Donald Trump	Now they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy I am.
0204	Donald Trump	But, I mean do you ever see anything  and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings.
0205	Donald Trump	Because they're putting like seven people all negative on Trump.
0206	Donald Trump	And they fired Jeffrey Lord, poor Jeffrey.
0207	Donald Trump	Jeffrey Lord.
0208	Donald Trump	I guess he was getting a little fed up, and he was probably fighting back a little bit too hard.
0209	Donald Trump	They said, we've better get out of here we can't have that.
0210	Donald Trump	And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neoNazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold true as Americans.
0211	Donald Trump	Now let me ask you, can it be any better than that, in all fairness?
0212	Donald Trump	And you know I mention that, but to the best of my knowledge when there was a big problem, Barack Obama never said it took place because of radical Islamic terrorists, he never said that, right. He doesn't have to say...
0213	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0214	Donald Trump	You know why?
0215	Donald Trump	Because they have a double standard.
0216	Donald Trump	Because the media is totally dishonest, and they have a double standard.
0217	Donald Trump	You never heard them say that.
0218	Donald Trump	And in fact, if you use the term you'd get criticized.
0219	Donald Trump	But with me, they wanted me to say it, and I said it.
0220	Donald Trump	And I said it very clearly, but they refused to put it on.
0221	Donald Trump	Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike the very core of America.
0222	Donald Trump	These are my words.
0223	Donald Trump	This was on Monday, August 14th.
0224	Donald Trump	So you had Saturday you had Monday.
0225	Donald Trump	You know, I was going to do one of these every week, but you would never get it right.
0226	Donald Trump	In times such as these, America has always shown its true character.
0227	Donald Trump	Responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.
0228	Donald Trump	And then I finished, I said, "We will defend or protect the sacred rights of all Americans."
0229	Donald Trump	All is capitalized times five.
0230	Donald Trump	Not just you.
0231	Donald Trump	And we will work together so that every citizen  every citizen is free to follow their dreams and their hearts and to express the love and joy in their souls.
0232	Donald Trump	OK now, I mean  so they were having a hard time with that one, because I said everything.
0233	Donald Trump	I hit him with neoNazi.
0234	Donald Trump	I hit them with everything.
0235	Donald Trump	I got the white supremacists, the neoNazi.
0236	Donald Trump	I got them all in there, let's say.
0237	Donald Trump	KKK, we have KKK.
0238	Donald Trump	I got them all.
0239	Donald Trump	So they're having a hard time.
0240	Donald Trump	So what are they say, right?
0241	Donald Trump	It should have been sooner.
0242	Donald Trump	He's a racist.
0243	Donald Trump	It should have been sooner, OK.
0244	Donald Trump	So it should have been  so then the last one, on Tuesday  Tuesday I did another one "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.
0245	Donald Trump	It has no place in America."
0246	Donald Trump	But they also said that he must be a racist because he never mentioned the driver of the car, who is a terrible person, drove the car and he killed Heather, and it's a terrible thing.
0247	Donald Trump	But they said I didn't mention, so these are my words.
0248	Donald Trump	The driver of the car is a murderer, and what he did was a horrible, inexcusable thing.
0249	Donald Trump	They said I didn't mention it.
0250	Donald Trump	And then they asked me, just to finish it, they asked me, what about race relations in the United States?
0251	Donald Trump	Now I have to say they were pretty bad under Barack Obama, that I can tell you.
0252	Donald Trump	But, they asked me the question.
0253	Donald Trump	And I said, well, I think jobs can have a very big and positive impact.
0254	Donald Trump	I think if we continue to create jobs like I've done  over one million since I've been in office...
0255	Donald Trump	Way over one million.
0256	Donald Trump	I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.
0257	Donald Trump	I do.
0258	Donald Trump	I do.
0259	Donald Trump	And the other thing  very important  I believe wages will start going up, because we now have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in 17 years, so you're going to see wages go up, right?
0260	Donald Trump	They haven't gone up for a long time.
0261	Donald Trump	I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up, and I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.
0262	Donald Trump	So that was my words.
0263	Donald Trump	Now, you know, I was a good student.
0264	Donald Trump	I always hear about the elite.
0265	Donald Trump	You know, the elite.
0266	Donald Trump	They're elite?
0267	Donald Trump	I went to better schools than they did.
0268	Donald Trump	I was a better student than they were.
0269	Donald Trump	I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great.
0270	Donald Trump	I think  you know what?
0271	Donald Trump	I think we're the elites.
0272	Donald Trump	They're not the elites.
0273	Donald Trump	So the point is  and I didn't want to bore you, because you understand where I'm coming from.
0274	Donald Trump	You people understand.
0275	Donald Trump	But the point is, that those were three different  there were two statements and one news conference.
0276	Donald Trump	The words were perfect.
0277	Donald Trump	They only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain.
0278	Donald Trump	But they don't put on those words.
0279	Donald Trump	And they don't put on me saying those words.
0280	Donald Trump	The media can attack me.
0281	Donald Trump	But where I draw the line is when they attack you, which is what they do.
0282	Donald Trump	When they attack the decency of our supporters.
0283	Donald Trump	You are honest, hardworking, taxpaying  and by the way, you're overtaxed, but we're going to get your taxes down.
0284	Donald Trump	You're taxpaying Americans who love our nation, obey our laws, and care for our people.
0285	Donald Trump	It's time to expose the crooked media deceptions, and to challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions.
0286	Donald Trump	And yes, by the way  and yes, by the way, they are trying to take away our history and our heritage.
0287	Donald Trump	You see that.
0288	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0289	Donald Trump	And  and I say it, and you know, we're all pros.
0290	Donald Trump	We're all, like, we have a certain sense.
0291	Donald Trump	We're smart people.
0292	Donald Trump	These are truly dishonest people.
0293	Donald Trump	And not all of them.
0294	Donald Trump	Not all of them.
0295	Donald Trump	You have some very good reporters.
0296	Donald Trump	You have some very fair journalists.
0297	Donald Trump	But for the most part, honestly, these are really, really dishonest people, and they're bad people.
0298	Donald Trump	And I really think they don't like our country.
0299	Donald Trump	I really believe that.
0300	Donald Trump	And I don't believe they're going to change, and that's why I do this.
0301	Donald Trump	If they would change, I would never say it.
0302	Donald Trump	The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself, and the fake news.
0303	Donald Trump	Oh, that's so funny.
0304	Donald Trump	Look back there, the live red lights.
0305	Donald Trump	They're turning those suckers off fast out there.
0306	Donald Trump	They're turning those lights off fast.
0307	Donald Trump	Like CNN.
0308	Donald Trump	CNN does not want its falling viewership to watch what I'm saying tonight, I can tell you.
0309	Donald Trump	I mean, the advantage I have  the advantage I have is that we do have a big voice.
0310	Donald Trump	And you know, they're always saying, like Twitter or social media  if I didn't have social media, I wouldn't be able to get the word out.
0311	Donald Trump	I probably wouldn't be standing here, right?
0312	Donald Trump	I probably wouldn't be standing here right now.
0313	Donald Trump	If I don't have social media, I probably would not be standing.
0314	Donald Trump	And do you ever notice, when I go on and I'll put, like, out a tweet or a couple of tweets, "He's in a Twitterstorm again!"
0315	Donald Trump	I  I don't do Twitterstorms.
0316	Donald Trump	You know, you'll put out a little tweet "I'm going to be with the veterans today."
0317	Donald Trump	They'll say, "Donald Trump is in a Twitterstorm."
0318	Donald Trump	These are sick people.
0319	Donald Trump	You know the thing I don't understand?
0320	Donald Trump	You would think  you would think they'd want to make our country great again, and I honestly believe they don't.
0321	Donald Trump	I honestly believe it.
0322	Donald Trump	If you want to discover the source of the division in our country, look no further than the fake news and the crooked media, which would rather get ratings and clicks than tell the truth.
0323	Donald Trump	I mean, the New York Times has written some stories.
0324	Donald Trump	How about this?
0325	Donald Trump	The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election, because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized.
0326	Donald Trump	I would say they did.
0327	Donald Trump	They say, well, it wasn't really that much of an apology.
0328	Donald Trump	Because they were losing so many people, because they were misled.
0329	Donald Trump	And I figured, this is great.
0330	Donald Trump	And for about two weeks I got good coverage.
0331	Donald Trump	Then they reverted back into worse than ever before.
0332	Donald Trump	You know, it's like one of those things.
0333	Donald Trump	The Washington Post is terrible.
0334	Donald Trump	But these are dishonest  but let me tell you, you have some great, honest papers.
0335	Donald Trump	You have some great networks.
0336	Donald Trump	I must tell you, Fox has treated me fairly.
0337	Donald Trump	Fox treated me fairly.
0338	Donald Trump	They've treated me fairly.
0339	Donald Trump	Hey, I'll let you know.
0340	Donald Trump	You know what?
0341	Donald Trump	Some day they might not treat me fairly, and I'll tell you about it, OK?
0342	Donald Trump	But they've treated me fairly, and I don't mean all good.
0343	Donald Trump	I get plenty of bad on Fox, too.
0344	Donald Trump	But at least it's within reason.
0345	Donald Trump	And Hannity?
0346	Donald Trump	How good is that?
0347	Donald Trump	How good is Hannity?
0348	Donald Trump	And he's a great guy, and he's an honest guy.
0349	Donald Trump	And "Fox and Friends in the Morning" is the best show, and it's the absolute, most honest show, and it's the show I watch.
0350	Donald Trump	Not only does  oh boy, those cameras are going off.
0351	Donald Trump	Oh, wow.
0352	Donald Trump	Why don't you just fold them up and take them home?
0353	Donald Trump	Oh, those cameras are going off.
0354	Donald Trump	Wow.
0355	Donald Trump	That's the one thing, they're very nervous to have me on live television, because this can happen.
0356	Donald Trump	Now, you know what?
0357	Donald Trump	I'm a person that wants to tell the truth.
0358	Donald Trump	I'm an honest person, and what I'm saying, you know is exactly right.
0359	Donald Trump	Not only does the media give a platform to hate groups, but the media turns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets, the failures of our public school, the destruction of our wealth at the hands of the terrible, terrible trade deals made by politicians that should've never been allowed to be politicians.
0360	Donald Trump	And the unaccountable hostility against our incredible police, who work so hard at such a dangerous job.
0361	Donald Trump	My administration is committed to the idea that all Americans have the right to live in safety, security and peace.
0362	Donald Trump	We believe in the rule of law, because we know that freedom cannot exist if our people are not safe.
0363	Donald Trump	And how safe are you at a Trump rally?
0364	Donald Trump	Remember at the beginning, remember when this already started?
0365	Donald Trump	When this started at the beginning, they used to send in thugs.
0366	Donald Trump	They had  our people are tougher than them, so it wasn't always very good for them.
0367	Donald Trump	But they'd send in thugs, and our people would protect themselves, and then you'd go home and you'd watch this violence.
0368	Donald Trump	Let me tell you, see this room?
0369	Donald Trump	You've got people outside, but not very many.
0370	Donald Trump	But see this room?
0371	Donald Trump	You're safe in this room.
0372	Donald Trump	You're very safe in this room.
0373	Donald Trump	It's a big room.
0374	Donald Trump	The most sacred duty of government is to protect the lives of its citizens, and that includes securing our borders, and enforcing our immigration laws.
0375	Donald Trump	By the way, I'm just curious.
0376	Donald Trump	Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?
0377	Donald Trump	So, was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?
0378	Donald Trump	That's why...
0379	Donald Trump	He should have had a jury, but you know what?
0380	Donald Trump	I'll make a prediction.
0381	Donald Trump	I think he's going to be just fine, OK?
0382	Donald Trump	But  but I won't do it tonight, because I don't want to cause any controversy.
0383	Donald Trump	Is that OK?
0384	Donald Trump	All right?
0385	Donald Trump	But Sheriff Joe can feel good.
0386	Donald Trump	The people of Arizona know the deadly and heartbreaking consequences of illegal immigration, the lost lives, the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking.
0387	Donald Trump	MS13  we're throwing them out so fast, they never got thrown out of anything like this.
0388	Donald Trump	We are liberating towns out on Long Island.
0389	Donald Trump	We're liberating.
0390	Donald Trump	Can you imagine, in this day and age  in this day and age in this country, we are liberating towns.
0391	Donald Trump	This is like from a different age.
0392	Donald Trump	We are taking these people.
0393	Donald Trump	They don't shoot people, because it's too fast and not painful.
0394	Donald Trump	They cut them up into little pieces.
0395	Donald Trump	These are animals.
0396	Donald Trump	We are getting them out of here.
0397	Donald Trump	We're throwing them in jails, and we're throwing them out of the country.
0398	Donald Trump	We're liberating our towns.
0399	Donald Trump	You're seen it.
0400	Donald Trump	You've lived it, and you elected me to put a stop to it.
0401	Donald Trump	And we are doing a phenomenal job of putting a stop to it.
0402	Donald Trump	That I can tell you.
0403	Donald Trump	After years of defending other countries borders  can you believe we fight for other countries we want to defend their borders  we're finally defending our own borders.
0404	Donald Trump	And we're showing compassion for these struggling American workers who are now starting to see the light because plants are coming pouring back into our country.
0405	Donald Trump	And by the way, we're doing a lot of good work on that, but a lot of people are coming back in.
0406	Donald Trump	We have Foxconn, they make the iPhones, as you know, for Apple, and so many companies are building now in our country.
0407	Donald Trump	Including the auto companies who are coming back.
0408	Donald Trump	Years of uncontrolled immigration have placed enormous pressure on the jobs and wages of working families, and they've put great burdens on local schools and hospitals.
0409	Donald Trump	While this may be good for a handful of special interests, it's unfair to working people of all backgrounds all throughout our country.
0410	Donald Trump	We want every American community to succeed, including our immigrant communities, but they can't do that if we don't control our borders.
0411	Donald Trump	Earlier today, I visited with the incredible men and women of ICE and the Border Patrol during a visit to Yuma Sector.
0412	Donald Trump	I was over at the Yuma Sector.
0413	Donald Trump	It was hot.
0414	Donald Trump	It was like 115 degrees.
0415	Donald Trump	I'm out signing autographs for an hour.
0416	Donald Trump	I was there.
0417	Donald Trump	That was a hot day.
0418	Donald Trump	You learn if you're in shape if you can do that, believe me.
0419	Donald Trump	And they actually told me  actually, sir, it's relatively cool today.
0420	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?
0421	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0422	Donald Trump	But it was great.
0423	Donald Trump	And I met with the Border Patrol and I met with ICE, and these are incredible people the job they do.
0424	Donald Trump	And in fact, General Kelly, who was in charge of Homeland Security, where people coming in down 78 and almost 80 percent.
0425	Donald Trump	He did so good, I made him my chief of staff, right?
0426	Donald Trump	That made sense.
0427	Donald Trump	John, where's John?
0428	Donald Trump	Where is he?
0429	Donald Trump	Where's General Kelly?
0430	Donald Trump	Get him out here.
0431	Donald Trump	He's great.
0432	Donald Trump	He's doing a great job.
0433	Donald Trump	But we did a lot before anything happened, we did a lot.
0434	Donald Trump	We respect and cherish our ICE officers and our Border Patrol agents, and we respect and cherish our police officers, and our firemen, and all of our uniform services.
0435	Donald Trump	But during that visit, I heard first hand from the frontline agents about the security threats they confront each and every day, and I pledged my continued resolve to them, and all of you, to keep our country safe.
0436	Donald Trump	All around the nation, I have spent time with the wonderful Americans whose children were killed for the simple reason that our government failed to enforce our immigration laws, already existing laws.
0437	Donald Trump	And I promised these families, the deaths of their loved ones will not have been in vain.
0438	Donald Trump	I promised them.
0439	Donald Trump	I know so many of them.
0440	Donald Trump	One by one we are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminals who prey on our people.
0441	Donald Trump	We are throwing them out of the country or we're putting the hell, fast in jail.
0442	Donald Trump	We are cracking down on these sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens, finally.
0443	Donald Trump	And we are building a wall on the southern border which is absolutely necessary.
0444	SYSTEM	[Crowd Chants Build that Wall]
0445	Donald Trump	Build that wall.
0446	Donald Trump	Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it.
0447	Donald Trump	But believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.
0448	Donald Trump	Let me be very clear to Democrats in Congress who oppose a border wall and stand in the way of border security You are putting all of America's safety at risk.
0449	Donald Trump	You're doing that.
0450	Donald Trump	You're doing that.
0451	Donald Trump	Again, the Border Patrol today, I said, how important is the wall to some of the folks?
0452	Donald Trump	I met with a lot of them.
0453	Donald Trump	And they looked at me, they said, it's vital.
0454	Donald Trump	It's vital.
0455	Donald Trump	It's so vital.
0456	Donald Trump	And you know, we have walls.
0457	Donald Trump	I don't know if you know, we're already starting to fix a lot of the walls we already have, because we don't have to rebuild them.
0458	Donald Trump	And we want walls that you can see through in a sense.
0459	Donald Trump	You want to see what's on the other side.
0460	Donald Trump	But we're starting to fix a lot of the walls.
0461	Donald Trump	We've done a lot of work.
0462	Donald Trump	But I said to them, how are we doing and how important are the walls?
0463	Donald Trump	And they said, Mr. President, you have no idea.
0464	Donald Trump	It is desperately needed.
0465	Donald Trump	We're going to have our wall.
0466	Donald Trump	We're going to get our wall.
0467	Donald Trump	And that wall is also going to help us, very importantly, with the drug problem, and the massive amounts of drugs that are pouring across the southern border.
0468	Donald Trump	My administration will never back down in demanding immigration control.
0469	Donald Trump	The American people voted for immigration control.
0470	Donald Trump	That's one of the reasons I'm here, and that is what the American people deserve, and they're going to get it.
0471	Donald Trump	So you put pressure, but believe me, one way or the other, we're going to get that wall.
0472	Donald Trump	Immigration security is also a matter, remember this, of national security.
0473	Donald Trump	That's why we're implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.
0474	Donald Trump	You look at what just happened in Spain and so many other places.
0475	Donald Trump	Nope.
0476	Donald Trump	We're really vetting.
0477	Donald Trump	We're tough. Does anybody want me to be soft on the vetting or would you like 
0478	SYSTEM	[Crowd yells No]
0479	Donald Trump	Extreme vetting  I came up with that term.
0480	Donald Trump	That's what it has to be.
0481	Donald Trump	So I have a message for Congress tonight You're job is to represent American families, American people, American workers.
0482	Donald Trump	That's your job.
0483	Donald Trump	You need to represent them on the border, on taxes, on healthcare  one vote  and on every other issue that affects their lives.
0484	Donald Trump	And for our friends in the Senate, oh boy  the Senate, remember this  look, the Senate, we have to get rid of what's called the filibuster rule we have to.
0485	Donald Trump	And if we don't, the Republicans will never get anything passed.
0486	Donald Trump	You're wasting your time.
0487	Donald Trump	We have to get rid of the filibuster rule.
0488	Donald Trump	Right now, we need 60 votes and we have 52 Republicans.
0489	Donald Trump	That means that eight Democrats are controlling all of this legislation.
0490	Donald Trump	We have over 200 bills.
0491	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0492	Donald Trump	And we have to speak to Mitch and we have to speak to everybody.
0493	Donald Trump	And I want to tell you, we have some great, great Republican senators.
0494	Donald Trump	We really do, and they fought like hell to get that thing approved.
0495	Donald Trump	They fought.
0496	Donald Trump	They really did.
0497	Donald Trump	They really fought.
0498	Donald Trump	Now, even on healthcare, because of reconciliation, which, if you don't know, it doesn't matter.
0499	Donald Trump	It's a trick.
0500	Donald Trump	We needed 51 votes.
0501	Donald Trump	But when you need 51, and you have 52, and we include the vice president, who always votes with us.
0502	Donald Trump	He's the greatest.
0503	Donald Trump	But you have no margin.
0504	Donald Trump	But some of the best things in healthcare require 60 votes.
0505	Donald Trump	So even when you say we're voting on healthcare, like across state lines, purchase across state lines.
0506	Donald Trump	One of the most important things, I've been talking about it for two years during debates.
0507	Donald Trump	It gives competition.
0508	Donald Trump	Insurance companies come in, your prices go way down.
0509	Donald Trump	Arizona is a disaster in terms of the price increase of your insurance, 116 percent interest.
0510	Donald Trump	You got to get rid of the filibuster rule.
0511	Donald Trump	You've got to go to a majority.
0512	Donald Trump	You've got to go to 51 votes, and if they don't do that they're  they're just wasting time.
0513	Donald Trump	All of the Democrats in Congress, that's the only thing they do well.
0514	Donald Trump	They do one thing well.
0515	Donald Trump	You know what it's called?
0516	Donald Trump	They have no ideas.
0517	Donald Trump	They have no policies.
0518	Donald Trump	They obstruct.
0519	Donald Trump	That's all they do.
0520	Donald Trump	They're word is, we resist.
0521	Donald Trump	They don't resist they obstruct.
0522	Donald Trump	It's all they're good at.
0523	Donald Trump	It's all they're good at.
0524	Donald Trump	That's all they do.
0525	Donald Trump	On healthcare, they have 48 Democrats.
0526	Donald Trump	We got no votes.
0527	Donald Trump	We got no votes.
0528	Donald Trump	And it would have been great healthcare.
0529	Donald Trump	And by the way, would have been great healthcare for Arizona.
0530	Donald Trump	Would have been great.
0531	Donald Trump	So the Democrats have no ideas, no policy, no vision for the country other than total socialism and maybe, frankly, a step beyond socialism from what I'm seeing.
0532	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0533	Donald Trump	Under they're plan for America, your taxes will double or triple, your service will diminish and your borders will be left wide open for everybody to come in and enjoy our country.
0534	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0535	Donald Trump	Obamacare is a disaster and think  think, we were just one vote away from victory after seven years of everybody proclaiming repeal and replace.
0536	Donald Trump	One vote away.
0537	Donald Trump	One vote away.
0538	Donald Trump	We were one vote away.
0539	Donald Trump	Think of it, seven years the Republicans  and again, you have some great senators, but we were one vote away from repealing it.
0540	SYSTEM	[Crowd chanting]
0541	Donald Trump	But, you know, they all said, Mr.
0542	Donald Trump	President, your speech was so good last night, please, please, Mr. President don't mention any names.
0543	Donald Trump	So I won't.
0544	Donald Trump	I won't.
0545	Donald Trump	No I won't vote  one vote away, I will not mention any names.
0546	Donald Trump	Very presidential, isn't' it?
0547	Donald Trump	Very presidential.
0548	Donald Trump	And nobody wants me to talk about your other senator, who's weak on borders, weak on crime, so I won't talk about him.
0549	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0550	Donald Trump	Nobody wants me to talk about him.
0551	Donald Trump	Nobody knows who the hell he is.
0552	Donald Trump	And now  see, I haven't' mentioned any names.
0553	Donald Trump	So now, everybody's happy.
0554	Donald Trump	But we are going to get rid of Obamacare.
0555	Donald Trump	I will never stop  one vote  I will never stop.
0556	Donald Trump	We're going to get rid of Obamacare.
0557	Donald Trump	Every day we're keeping our promises, and that includes our promises to our great, great veterans.
0558	Donald Trump	Who's a veteran here?
0559	Donald Trump	It's getting better, getting really good.
0560	Donald Trump	Nobody's fixed it  nobody's been able to do it.
0561	Donald Trump	And remember, I'm only here for less than eight months, you know.
0562	Donald Trump	When they talk about Obamacare, it was years. When they talk Hillary Clinton spent eight years trying to get...
0563	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0564	Donald Trump	Eight years trying to get health care.
0565	SYSTEM	[Crowd chanting]
0566	Donald Trump	Well, it's obvious that we won the state of Arizona, do you agree with that?
0567	Donald Trump	It's pretty obvious.
0568	Donald Trump	And we won it by a lot.
0569	Donald Trump	And I hear we're winning it by even more right now.
0570	Donald Trump	But if you think about it, Clinton, they spent eight years that they weren't able to get health care.
0571	Donald Trump	Other administrations spent all of their time, they weren't able to get it.
0572	Donald Trump	Obama, what he did to get it.
0573	Donald Trump	What he did to get it, including the guy, Gruber.
0574	Donald Trump	Did you see Gruber got fired yesterday?
0575	Donald Trump	He got fired because he defrauded somebody or something.
0576	Donald Trump	Something very bad happened.
0577	Donald Trump	Check it out.
0578	Donald Trump	Something happened.
0579	Donald Trump	Gruber, who lied about Obamacare, who called everybody fools for believing it.
0580	Donald Trump	Obamacare is gone.
0581	Donald Trump	It's a disaster.
0582	Donald Trump	It's gone.
0583	Donald Trump	Premiums in other states are going up in numbers that are even higher than the state of Arizona.
0584	Donald Trump	Insurance companies are fleeing, and it's gone.
0585	Donald Trump	So we're going to  I really believe that the Republicans  and maybe we'll get a couple of senators that think they're going to lose their race on the Democratic side, maybe, but we'll get it fixed.
0586	Donald Trump	One vote  speak to your Senator, please.
0587	Donald Trump	Speak to your Senator.
0588	Donald Trump	We're reforming the V.A.
0589	Donald Trump	to ensure our veterans have the care they so richly deserve, including choice  choice  choice.
0590	Donald Trump	In other words, if you've got to wait for seven days and you're not feeling well, you go see a doctor and we pay for your doctor.
0591	Donald Trump	Isn't that good?
0592	Donald Trump	And we've got legislation approved that everybody said was impossible.
0593	Donald Trump	It's called V.A.
0594	Donald Trump	Accountability.
0595	Donald Trump	If somebody treats our veterans badly, we can fire them.
0596	Donald Trump	We say you're fired get out of here.
0597	Donald Trump	Everybody said  everybody said you couldn't get that  they've been trying to get that passed for 40 years.
0598	Donald Trump	We got great legislation.
0599	Donald Trump	You ever hear of these liars back there, where they say, but Trump hasn't gotten  I think we've gotten more in a short period of time, in this seven months,
0600	Donald Trump	I think we've gotten more than anybody, including Harry Truman, who was number one, but they will tell you we've got none.
0601	Donald Trump	So we got V.A.
0602	Donald Trump	Accountability so that you can fire people that are treating our veterans badly or aren't doing their jobs.
0603	Donald Trump	Isn't that great?
0604	Donald Trump	We've also obtained historic increase in defense spending to prevent and deter conflict.
0605	Donald Trump	We believe in peace through strength.
0606	Donald Trump	We're building up our military like never before.
0607	Donald Trump	Thousands and thousands of brave Americans have paid the ultimate price for our freedom.
0608	Donald Trump	Now it's up to us to preserve and protect their legacy.
0609	Donald Trump	Last night, as you know, I laid out my vision for I'm honorable and enduring outcome in a very tough place, a place where country has failed, Afghanistan.
0610	Donald Trump	This is the place where terrorists are trained, where you have people that are not exactly United States fans, can I say that?
0611	Donald Trump	And I will tell you then what we're going to do with our incredible military, they're going to make unbelievable sacrifices, and they've already made, in some cases, the ultimate sacrifice.
0612	Donald Trump	But we're fighting for them.
0613	Donald Trump	Our warfighters deserve the tools they need, and the trust they've earned to fight and to win.
0614	Donald Trump	Fight and to win.
0615	Donald Trump	And you see what's going on in North Korea.
0616	Donald Trump	All of a sudden, I don't know  who knows.
0617	Donald Trump	But I can tell you, what I said, that's not strong enough.
0618	Donald Trump	Some people said it's too strong, it's not strong enough.
0619	Donald Trump	But Kim Jong Un, I respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us.
0620	Donald Trump	I respect that fact very much.
0621	Donald Trump	Respect that fact.
0622	Donald Trump	And maybe  probably not  but maybe something positive can come about.
0623	Donald Trump	They won't tell you that, but maybe something positive can come about.
0624	Donald Trump	Every American deserves a government that protects them, honors them, defends them, and fights for them.
0625	Donald Trump	And by the way, speaking of that, you have three congressman in the audience and your governor who met me at the plane, and he's now inside, but he said I want to spend my time outside on security.
0626	Donald Trump	I said, I think that's a great idea, governor.
0627	Donald Trump	But not that many people showed up so I don't think it should be much of a problem.
0628	Donald Trump	But you have a hell of a governor, Governor Ducey.
0629	Donald Trump	You have a great governor.
0630	Donald Trump	And we have three congressman, a friend of mine who has been so great to me, Trent Franks.
0631	Donald Trump	Where is Congressman Franks?
0632	Donald Trump	Where is he?
0633	Donald Trump	Get over here.
0634	Donald Trump	Paul Gosar, Congressman, Congressman Andy Biggs.
0635	Donald Trump	Get up here, fellow.
0636	Donald Trump	Thank you, fellows.
0637	Donald Trump	Thank you, congressman.
0638	Donald Trump	Never let them go, folks.
0639	Donald Trump	Never let them go.
0640	Donald Trump	Don't ever lose them.
0641	Donald Trump	Thank you, fellows.
0642	Donald Trump	So, in Washington, we're taking power out of the hands of donors and special interests, and putting that power back into the hands of the people that voted for us, OK?
0643	Donald Trump	For us.
0644	Donald Trump	The same failed voices in Washington who opposed our movement are the same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs.
0645	Donald Trump	We don't need advice from the Washington, D.C. swamp.
0646	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0647	Donald Trump	We need, right now, to drain the swamp.
0648	Donald Trump	That's what's happening, too, believe me.
0649	Donald Trump	Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves.
0650	Donald Trump	But I don't come to Washington for me.
0651	Donald Trump	You know, I've had a great life.
0652	Donald Trump	I've had great success.
0653	Donald Trump	I've enjoyed my life.
0654	Donald Trump	Most people think I'm crazy to have done this.
0655	Donald Trump	And I think they're right.
0656	Donald Trump	But I enjoy it, because we've made so much  I don't believe that any president  I don't believe that any president has accomplished as much as this president in the first six or seven months.
0657	Donald Trump	I really don't believe it.
0658	Donald Trump	Including  including a great Supreme Court justice, Justice Gorsuch. Big
0659	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0660	Donald Trump	.
0661	Donald Trump	I came to Washington for you.
0662	Donald Trump	Your dreams are my dreams.
0663	Donald Trump	Your hopes are my hopes.
0664	Donald Trump	And your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day.
0665	Donald Trump	It's so important.
0666	Donald Trump	Our agenda is the proworker agenda.
0667	Donald Trump	We've accomplished historic amounts in a short period of time.
0668	Donald Trump	We've signed more than 50 pieces of legislation.
0669	Donald Trump	They said we've signed none  none.
0670	Donald Trump	We've signed 50 appointed Justice Gorsuch nominated 31 new federal judges, with many more on the way.
0671	Donald Trump	So, importantly, we have aggressively canceled jobkilling regulations, and we're unleashing jobcreating American energy like we've never unleashed before.
0672	Donald Trump	We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and it's just been announced that a second, brandnew coal mine, where they're going to take out clean coal  meaning, they're taking out coal.
0673	Donald Trump	They're going to clean it  is opening in the state of Pennsylvania, the second one.
0674	Donald Trump	And the state of West Virginia, which was way behind and lagging, was now, in terms of GDP increase, second last quarter to the state of Texas.
0675	Donald Trump	How about that?
0676	Donald Trump	West Virginia.
0677	Donald Trump	And they have a great governor in West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice, who just quit the Democrats and joined the Republican Party.
0678	Donald Trump	In the proud tradition of America's great leaders, from George Washington  please, don't take his statue down, please.
0679	Donald Trump	Please.
0680	Donald Trump	Does anybody want George Washington's statue?
0681	Donald Trump	No.
0682	Donald Trump	Is that sad?
0683	Donald Trump	Is that all sad?
0684	Donald Trump	To Lincoln, to Teddy Roosevelt, I see they want to take Teddy Roosevelt's down, too.
0685	Donald Trump	They're trying to figure out why.
0686	Donald Trump	They don't know.
0687	Donald Trump	They're trying to take away our culture.
0688	Donald Trump	They are trying to take away our history.
0689	Donald Trump	And our weak leaders, they do it overnight.
0690	Donald Trump	These things have been there for 150 years, for 100 years.
0691	Donald Trump	You go back to a university, and it's gone.
0692	Donald Trump	Weak, weak people.
0693	Donald Trump	We are going to protect American industry.
0694	Donald Trump	We are going to protect the American worker.
0695	Donald Trump	No longer will we allow other countries to close our factories, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth.
0696	Donald Trump	We are building our future with American hands, American labor, American iron, aluminum, and steel.
0697	Donald Trump	We will buy American, and we will hire American.
0698	Donald Trump	I immediately withdrew the United States from the disastrous TransPacific Partnership.
0699	Donald Trump	Would have been a disaster.
0700	Donald Trump	And you know, that one of the worst deals that anybody in history has ever entered into.
0701	Donald Trump	We have begun formal renegotiation with Mexico and Canada on NAFTA.
0702	Donald Trump	And I must be honest, and I've been talking about NAFTA for a long time, and I'm sorry it's taken six months, but we have to give notice.
0703	Donald Trump	You have to see this.
0704	Donald Trump	We have to give notice, and after the notice is given, you have to wait a long time.
0705	Donald Trump	Then you have to give another one, then you have to wait a long time.
0706	Donald Trump	Anyway, we started two days ago, Bob Lighthizer.
0707	Donald Trump	Personally, I don't think we can make a deal, because we have been so badly taken advantage of They have made such great deals, both of the countries, but in particular, Mexico, that I don't think we can make a deal.
0708	Donald Trump	So I think we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point, OK?
0709	Donald Trump	Probably.
0710	Donald Trump	But  but I told you from the first day, we will renegotiate NAFTA, or we will terminate NAFTA.
0711	Donald Trump	I personally don't think you can make a deal without a termination, but we're going to see what happens, OK?
0712	Donald Trump	You're in  you're in good hands, I can tell you.
0713	Donald Trump	We are unleashing American energy, and I withdrew the United States from the jobkilling Paris Climate Accord.
0714	Donald Trump	People have no idea how bad that was for this country.
0715	Donald Trump	Great for other countries.
0716	Donald Trump	We were like the lap dog.
0717	Donald Trump	Great for other countries.
0718	Donald Trump	Our country was so behind.
0719	Donald Trump	Since I took the oath of office, we've added far more than one million jobs in the private sector.
0720	Donald Trump	Unemployment is, right now, at almost a 17year low.
0721	Donald Trump	Wages are rising.
0722	Donald Trump	The stock market is at its alltime high in history, and economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent.
0723	Donald Trump	Remember, everybody said you won't bring it up to 1 percent.
0724	Donald Trump	You won't bring it up to 1.2 percent.
0725	Donald Trump	And we've just started.
0726	Donald Trump	Those regulations that we've gotten rid of, which  and we're going to have some regulation, but it's going to be sensible regulation.
0727	Donald Trump	Those regulations are unleashing our economy.
0728	Donald Trump	So we have a GDP, it was shocking, about two weeks ago it was announced for the quarter 2.6 percent.
0729	Donald Trump	Remember, I said we're going to try and hit 3 percent?
0730	Donald Trump	We're already at 2.6.
0731	Donald Trump	Maybe I'll have to increase my offer.
0732	Donald Trump	And so many of those people, you know, the Economic Council?
0733	Donald Trump	When it got a little heat with the lies from the media, they sort of said, Oh, we'll take a pass.
0734	Donald Trump	Not all of them, but some of them did.
0735	Donald Trump	But I remember the ones that did.
0736	Donald Trump	But they'll say, We take  oh, we'll take  but people are now calling me, people that have been, like, we'll take a pass  Don, can we get together for lunch?
0737	Donald Trump	Let's do it privately, instead of through a council.
0738	Donald Trump	These people just don't get it.
0739	Donald Trump	They are calling, and they're saying, how about getting together privately?
0740	Donald Trump	They like it better.
0741	Donald Trump	Why should they be on a council?
0742	Donald Trump	You know, that's the way it is, folks.
0743	Donald Trump	That's the way it is.
0744	Donald Trump	To bring more jobs and industry to our shores, we are committed to passing the first major tax reform in over 30 years.
0745	Donald Trump	Now, we need the help of Congress, please.
0746	Donald Trump	OK?
0747	Donald Trump	We need the help of Congress.
0748	Donald Trump	And we really could use some Democrat help.
0749	Donald Trump	We're giving you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.
0750	Donald Trump	The Democrats are going to find a way to obstruct.
0751	Donald Trump	If they do, remember, they are stopping from getting a massive tax cut.
0752	Donald Trump	Just remember that, OK?
0753	Donald Trump	America's crushing business tax is a massive, selfinflicted, economic wound.
0754	Donald Trump	We have one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, pushing jobs and wealth out of our country.
0755	Donald Trump	That is why we are going to lower the tax on American business, to bring back those companies, bring them back to America.
0756	Donald Trump	We want more products stamped with the letters, "Made in the U.S.A.".
0757	Donald Trump	We also want everyday Americans to be able to keep more of their own money.
0758	Donald Trump	So for the Democratic senators, especially the ones where I won their states by 20 and 30 points, I really hope you're going to come over to our side.
0759	Donald Trump	Because again, when you have 52 Republicans, if you lose like two, that's the end.
0760	Donald Trump	You know what, as good as something is, it's hard to get 51 out of 52.
0761	Donald Trump	So I hope some of the Democrats that are going to lose their election will come over and give everybody a big beautiful tax cut, which is going to be great for the economy.
0762	Donald Trump	It's time to pass a tax cut for the middleclass families.
0763	Donald Trump	We will make America the best place in the world to hire, grow and start a business again.
0764	Donald Trump	We want to lift our people from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.
0765	Donald Trump	We're going to do an infrastructure bill.
0766	Donald Trump	We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, waterways, all across our beautiful land.
0767	Donald Trump	Our greatest creations, our most incredible buildings, our most beautiful works of art are just waiting to be brought to life.
0768	Donald Trump	American hands will build this future.
0769	Donald Trump	American energy will power this future.
0770	Donald Trump	We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently.
0771	Donald Trump	And American workers will bring this future to life.
0772	Donald Trump	We are the nation that dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, put a man on the moon, and defeated communism.
0773	Donald Trump	We can do anything, we can build anything and we can dream anything.
0774	Donald Trump	It's time to remember what our brave soldiers never forgot.
0775	Donald Trump	Americans share one flag, one home and one glorious destiny.
0776	Donald Trump	We live according to the same law, raise our children by the same values, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.
0777	Donald Trump	As long as we remember these truths, as long as we have enough strength and courage in ourselves, then there is no challenge too great, no task too large, no dream beyond our reach.
0778	Donald Trump	We are Americans, and the future belongs to us.
0779	Donald Trump	The future belongs to all of you.
0780	Donald Trump	This is our moment.
0781	Donald Trump	This is our chance.
0782	Donald Trump	This is our opportunity to recapture our dynasty like never before, to rebuild our future, to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in America.
0783	Donald Trump	Freedom will prevail, our values will endure, our citizens will prosper, Arizona will thrive, and our beloved nation will succeed like never, ever before.
0784	Donald Trump	So to Americans young and old, near and far, in cities small and large, we say these words again tonight We will make America strong again.
0785	Donald Trump	We will make America wealthy again.
0786	Donald Trump	We will make America proud again.
0787	Donald Trump	We will make America safe again.
0788	Donald Trump	And we will make America great again.
0789	Donald Trump	Thank you Arizona.
0790	Donald Trump	God bless you.
0791	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0792	Donald Trump	Thank you.
