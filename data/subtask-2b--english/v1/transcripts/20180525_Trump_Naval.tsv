0003	Donald Trump	Hello, midshipmen, hello.
0004	Donald Trump	Let me say to the entire brigadeplease be at easeenjoy yourselves, because we are all here to celebrate the amazing class of 2018.
0005	Donald Trump	Amazing job.
0006	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0007	Donald Trump	Really something.
0008	Donald Trump	Admiral Carter, thank you for that wonderful introduction and for your leadership, an incredible job you have done at this storied academy.
0009	Donald Trump	And thank you, Captain Chadwick, for your dedication and service.
0010	Donald Trump	Thank you to Undersecretary Modly, Admiral Richardson, General Walters, for joining us today.
0011	Donald Trump	Thanks also to Senator Wicker, Congressman Wittman, Congressman Valadao.
0012	Donald Trump	I want to recognize the entire brigade for a tremendous year.
0013	Donald Trump	This has been a spectacular year for you.
0014	Donald Trump	I have heard all about your achievements.
0015	Donald Trump	And a very special recognition for the midshipmen fourth class, you are plebs no more.
0016	Donald Trump	To all of the distinguished faculty and staff, to the local sponsor families, and most importantly, to the parents and grandparents and family members who have helped our graduates reached this joyous hour, today is your incredible achievement also.
0017	Donald Trump	They would have never made it without you, know this.
0018	Donald Trump	I want to thank the midshipmen and your families, and thank you.
0019	Donald Trump	America thanks you more than anybody.
0020	Donald Trump	You have done a spectacular job.
0021	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0022	Donald Trump	Finally, to the men and women about to be commissioned as ensigns in the Navy and second lieutenants in the Marine Corps, let me say on behalf of the entire nation, we could not be more proud of the United States Naval Academy Class of 2018.
0023	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0024	Donald Trump	Great job.
0025	Donald Trump	Congratulations to you all.
0026	Donald Trump	Four years ago, each of you made the most important decision of your lives.
0027	Donald Trump	You chose the path of hard work, sweat, and sacrifice.
0028	Donald Trump	You chose the life of honor, courage, and commitment.
0029	Donald Trump	You chose to serve the nation and defend our great American flag.
0030	Donald Trump	You chose the Navy, blue and gold, from the first moments of induction day.
0031	Donald Trump	Through a grueling six weeks of pleb summer, you endured and you persevered.
0032	Donald Trump	And then the rest of the brigade returned, and the real test began.
0033	Donald Trump	You developed morally, mentally, and physically.
0034	Donald Trump	You poured yourselves into military tactics, seamanship, navigation, ethics, and engineering.
0035	Donald Trump	And when hard work was not enough, like generations before you, you gathered your pennies and sought favor from the allpowerful Tecumseh.
0036	Donald Trump	Allpowerful.
0037	Donald Trump	A little bit different.
0038	Donald Trump	Others worked hard for their demerits at McGarvey's and the Fleet Reserve Club.
0039	Donald Trump	And so today in keeping with tradition, I declare that all midshipmen on restriction for minor offenses, you are hereby absolved.
0040	Donald Trump	That sounds like a lot of people.
0041	Donald Trump	The Admiral will define exactly what that means, so Admiral, please go easy.
0042	Donald Trump	This is a great group of people here, Admiral.
0043	Donald Trump	I am told this class led Navy athletics to the highest win percentage in your 172year history.
0044	Donald Trump	Think about that.
0045	Donald Trump	That includes taking the ArmyNavy Star Series for the fourth straight year, a remarkable achievement in sport and athletics.
0046	Donald Trump	And because you care about every contest against Army, for the record, this year, Navy beat Army 19 times.
0047	Donald Trump	And I will not mention, I promised, who won the football game.
0048	Donald Trump	I will not mention it.
0049	Donald Trump	I refuse to say it.
0050	Donald Trump	But that is a great achievement.
0051	Donald Trump	And let me take a guess, you are still not tired of winning.
0052	Donald Trump	Winning is such a great feeling, isn't it?
0053	Donald Trump	Winning is such a great feeling.
0054	Donald Trump	Nothing like winning, you got to win.
0055	Donald Trump	In every endeavor, the class of 2018 has shown its metal and it's proved its might.
0056	Donald Trump	You have earned your place in the ancient league of sailors and shipmates, captains and commanders, warriors and mariners, and Marines.
0057	Donald Trump	You crave adventure.
0058	Donald Trump	Hello, folks, back there.
0059	Donald Trump	You chase discovery, and you never flinch in the eye of a raging storm.
0060	Donald Trump	America is in your heart.
0061	Donald Trump	The ocean is in your soul.
0062	Donald Trump	The saltwater runs through your veins.
0063	Donald Trump	You live your life according to the final law of the Navy.
0064	Donald Trump	The word impossible does not exist, because Navy never quits.
0065	Donald Trump	You don't give up.
0066	Donald Trump	You don't give in.
0067	Donald Trump	You don't back down.
0068	Donald Trump	And you never surrender.
0069	Donald Trump	Wherever you go, wherever you serve, wherever your mission takes you, you only have one word in mind, and that's victory.
0070	Donald Trump	That is why you are here.
0071	Donald Trump	Victory.
0072	Donald Trump	A very important word.
0073	Donald Trump	You are now leaders in the most powerful and righteous force on the face of the planet.
0074	Donald Trump	The United States military.
0075	Donald Trump	And we are respected again, I can tell you that.
0076	Donald Trump	We are respected again.
0077	Donald Trump	A lot of things have happened.
0078	Donald Trump	We are respected again.
0079	Donald Trump	For the last four years, you have walked the same paths as Navy's greatest legends, the giants of Midway and Coral Sea and Manila Bay.
0080	Donald Trump	Here in Annapolis, the glorious past is all around you, and so are the stories of your great heroes.
0081	Donald Trump	One such hero who appears in the pages of your old yearbooks is Bruce Voorhees.
0082	Donald Trump	Wellknown all over.
0083	Donald Trump	Bruce hailed from Nevada and was a member of the Naval Academy class of 1929.
0084	Donald Trump	Beneath his picture in the 1929 Lucky Bag, Bruce's classmates wrote that he spent most of his time teaching the city slickers from the east the correct pronunciation of Nevada.
0085	Donald Trump	And I had to learn that, too, to win the state.
0086	Donald Trump	Great place.
0087	Donald Trump	He saw studying as an unnecessary evil, and they remembered in three cruises and four years in blueserge brass buttons, he left a trail of broken hearts extending the full length of both coasts and radiating for miles around.
0088	Donald Trump	Crabtown.
0089	Donald Trump	In other words, he was just like you in many ways.
0090	Donald Trump	Just like you.
0091	Donald Trump	Not a lot of difference.
0092	Donald Trump	Just over a decade after his graduation, Lieutenant Commander Voorhees found himself at war.
0093	Donald Trump	Seventyfive years ago this summer, he was in the South Pacific commanding Bombing Squadron 102 during the battle of the Solomon Islands.
0094	Donald Trump	That was a rough battle.
0095	Donald Trump	His only brother had been killed and the Bataan Death March.
0096	Donald Trump	On July 6, Bruce volunteered for a mission to destroy a crucial enemy base.
0097	Donald Trump	It was a rough time.
0098	Donald Trump	It was a rough, tough situation.
0099	Donald Trump	He knew fullwell that he would likely never return.
0100	Donald Trump	He knew he was going to die.
0101	Donald Trump	But he also knew his daring action could prevent a surprise attack on largescale American forces.
0102	Donald Trump	So, his plane took off alone on a 700mile flight.
0103	Donald Trump	Bruce flew through the darkness to his target, a tiny speck on the vast open sea.
0104	Donald Trump	He braved unrelenting antiaircraft fire, like nobody had ever seen at that time, and a trail of enemy planes to singlehandedly destroy this large enemy base, including multiple fortifications, and a critical communications link.
0105	Donald Trump	And in this final act of valor, Bruce was caught in the blast of one of his own bombs and perished in a remote lagoon very far from here.
0106	Donald Trump	His life was lost, but his legacy will live forever.
0107	Donald Trump	Many of you have seen his old room at Bancroft Hall, commemorating his Congressional Medal of Honor, our highest honor.
0108	Donald Trump	Some here today will trace his path to Pensacola to earn your wings.
0109	Donald Trump	You may even make it all the way out to the legendary combattraining school known as Top Gun in bruce's beloved hometown in Nevada.
0110	Donald Trump	There, you will have the honor to take flight from the Voorhees Field, and remember a hero who fought for his country, and died for his homeland, and saved so many lives with his bravery.
0111	Donald Trump	Each of you inherits the legacy of the heroes who came before you.
0112	Donald Trump	It's a living history passed down from officer to officer and generation to generation.
0113	Donald Trump	Each of you will make your own mark on the Navy, the Marine Corps, the military, and the history of our great nation.
0114	Donald Trump	Seize today and you will shape tomorrow.
0115	Donald Trump	In a few moments, you will be commissioned into the mightiest fighting forces of the air, the land, and the sea.
0116	Donald Trump	Together, you will blast off carriers of which we are just now finishing, the largest aircraft carrier in the world, and launch off submarines of which we have many under construction, and ward off evil.
0117	Donald Trump	You will bring comfort to our friends and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies.
0118	Donald Trump	Among our graduates today will be 283 naval aviators, 134 submariners, 256 surfacewarfare officers, 70 restrictedline officers, and 15 explosiveordnancedisposal officers.
0119	Donald Trump	Twohundredandthirtysix United States Marines, and 35 very tough, very well conditioned Navy SEALs.
0120	Donald Trump	Together, you are the tip of the spear, the edge of the blade, and the front of the shield defending and protecting our great country.
0121	Donald Trump	You know, there is no mission our pilots can't handle.
0122	Donald Trump	There is no hill our Marines can't take, and there is no stronghold the SEALs can't reach.
0123	Donald Trump	There is no sea the Navy can't brave, and there is no storm the American sailor can't conquer.
0124	Donald Trump	Because you know that together, there is nothing Americans can't do.
0125	Donald Trump	Absolutely nothing.
0126	Donald Trump	In recent years and even decades, too many people have forgotten that truth.
0127	Donald Trump	They have forgotten that our ancestors trounced an empire, tamed a continent, and triumphed over the worst evils in history.
0128	Donald Trump	In every generation, there have been cynics and critics that try to tear down America.
0129	Donald Trump	But in recent years, the problem grew worse.
0130	Donald Trump	A growing number used their platforms to denigrate America's incredible heritage, challenge America's sovereignty, and weaken America's pride.
0131	Donald Trump	We know the truth, will speak the truth, and defend that truth.
0132	Donald Trump	America is the greatest fighting force for peace, justice, and freedom in the history of the world.
0133	Donald Trump	And in case you have not noticed, we have become a lot stronger lately.
0134	Donald Trump	A lot.
0135	Donald Trump	We are not going to apologize for America.
0136	Donald Trump	We are going to stand up for America.
0137	Donald Trump	No more apologies.
0138	Donald Trump	We are going to stand up for our citizens.
0139	Donald Trump	We are going to stand up for our values.
0140	Donald Trump	And we are going to stand up for our men and women in uniform.
0141	Donald Trump	Because we know that a nation must have pride in its history to have confidence in its future.
0142	Donald Trump	We are the nation that built the highways, the railroads, the Empire State Building in one year, the Golden Gate Bridge, and we are the nation that built the Panama Canal.
0143	Donald Trump	We trekked the mountains, explored the oceans, and settled the vast frontier.
0144	Donald Trump	We won two world wars, defeated communism and fascism, and put a man on the face of the moon.
0145	Donald Trump	We cured disease, pioneered science, and produced timeless works of art that inspire the human soul.
0146	Donald Trump	And on distant islands, faraway battlefields, above the skies and beneath the sea, the entire world has borne witness to the unstoppable strength, skill, and courage of the United States Navy and the American Marines.
0147	Donald Trump	Each of you enters service at a truly exciting time for our country.
0148	Donald Trump	For we are witnessing the great reawakening of the American spirit and of American might.
0149	Donald Trump	We have rediscovered our identity, regained our stride, and we are proud again.
0150	Donald Trump	Prosperity is booming at home.
0151	Donald Trump	Our economy is the strongest it has ever been.
0152	Donald Trump	And our country has regained the respect that we used to have long ago abroad.
0153	Donald Trump	Yes, they are respecting us again.
0154	Donald Trump	Yes, America is back.
0155	Donald Trump	We have begun the great rebuilding of the United States military.
0156	Donald Trump	We have ended the disastrous defense sequester.
0157	Donald Trump	No money for the military?
0158	Donald Trump	Those days are over.
0159	Donald Trump	And we have just secured, you have read all about it, a $700 billion, largestever amount of money to support our great war fighters.
0160	Donald Trump	And I might add that next yearthe $700 billion, not million.
0161	Donald Trump	They're liking the sound of million, but billion is betterthe $700 billion goes to $716 billion, and we are going to be stronger than ever before.
0162	Donald Trump	We will have the strongest military that we have ever had, and it won't even be close.
0163	Donald Trump	And when did we need it more than now?
0164	Donald Trump	That means new ships.
0165	Donald Trump	You like that.
0166	Donald Trump	We have now the lowest number of ships we have had since World War I.
0167	Donald Trump	And very soon, we are going to get to 355 beautiful ships.
0168	Donald Trump	That is almost a couple of hundred more ships.
0169	Donald Trump	So you will be around for a long time.
0170	Donald Trump	We are not running out of equipment.
0171	Donald Trump	We're not running out of ships.
0172	Donald Trump	And that has been approved.
0173	Donald Trump	And we are honored by it.
0174	Donald Trump	You are going to have new equipment, and welldeserved pay raises.
0175	Donald Trump	We just got to a big pay raise for the first time in 10 years.
0176	Donald Trump	We got to a big pay increase, first time in over 10 years.
0177	Donald Trump	I fought for you.
0178	Donald Trump	That was the hardest one to get.
0179	Donald Trump	But you never had a chance of losing.
0180	Donald Trump	I represented you well.
0181	Donald Trump	I represented you well.
0182	Donald Trump	And this week, we passed new landmark legislation to give more choice and better care to our great veterans.
0183	Donald Trump	We are going to take care of our veterans.
0184	Donald Trump	We are doing a great job with it.
0185	Donald Trump	We are taking care, finally, after decades, we are taking care of our veterans.
0186	Donald Trump	We passed VA accountability.
0187	Donald Trump	Everybody said it could not be done.
0188	Donald Trump	If you didn't do a good job, you could not get fired.
0189	Donald Trump	Now, you don't do a good job and take care of our veterans, they will look you in the eye and they say, "Jim
0190	Donald Trump	We will say, "Get him out of here
0191	Donald Trump	We are reestablishing the second fleet in the Atlantic bigger, better, stronger than it has ever been before.
0192	Donald Trump	We are rebuilding our defense industrial base to forge American iron, aluminum, and steel, which, by the way, we just put tariffs on when it comes in from other countries.
0193	Donald Trump	Okay?
0194	Donald Trump	We are taking in a lot of money now, our country.
0195	Donald Trump	They pay that big, beautiful tariff and it goes right into building new ships.
0196	Donald Trump	We have been taken advantage of by the world.
0197	Donald Trump	That is not going to be happening anymore.
0198	Donald Trump	You see what is going on.
0199	Donald Trump	So, we are building a modern fleet manned by the greatest sailors.
0200	Donald Trump	We're sharpening the fighting edge from Marines infantry squads to combat ships to deliver maximum, lethal force.
0201	Donald Trump	The enemy has to know we have that.
0202	Donald Trump	We are recommitting to this fundamental truth We are a maritime nation.
0203	Donald Trump	Being a maritime nation, we are surrounded by sea.
0204	Donald Trump	We must always dominate that sea.
0205	Donald Trump	We will always dominate the oceans.
0206	Donald Trump	We are showing what we can achieve when natural American confidence is backed by unrivaled American power and unquestioned American resolve.
0207	Donald Trump	Also, there is another word that's never used, and I will use it today.
0208	Donald Trump	It's called talent.
0209	Donald Trump	We have talent and a lot of other people don't, and a lot of other countries don't.
0210	Donald Trump	We have great talent and I have seen it.
0211	Donald Trump	In other words, we are showing what is possible when America starts acting like its sailors and Marines.
0212	Donald Trump	Our nation cannot be strong without the heroes whose hearts stir the words Don't give up the ship.
0213	Donald Trump	Famous phrase.
0214	Donald Trump	We even use it in business.
0215	Donald Trump	Things are going bad, you say, "Don't give up the ship.""
0216	Donald Trump	Keep fighting.
0217	Donald Trump	Don't give up the ship.
0218	Donald Trump	But it's reallyyou guys started it.
0219	Donald Trump	Our country cannot prevail without those who rally to the famous cry
0220	Donald Trump	You hail from every background and you come from every walk of life.
0221	Donald Trump	But each of you is formed by the same defining choice, to answer the call.
0222	Donald Trump	You all share the same heart, the same blood, and swear by the same motto Not for self but country.
0223	Donald Trump	It's a great motto.
0224	Donald Trump	With us today are living symbols of that long and unbroken chain of American patriots, members of the Naval Academy class of 1968.
0225	Donald Trump	That's great.
0226	Donald Trump	Stand up, please.
0227	Donald Trump	Exactly 50 years ago, they were in your shoes.
0228	Donald Trump	They embarked into service and they made America very proud.
0229	Donald Trump	To everyone in the class of 1968, we thank you and we salute you.
0230	Donald Trump	Like those who came before them, today's graduates will serve America through times of triumph and some hours of peril.
0231	Donald Trump	There will be hours of peril.
0232	Donald Trump	You will face new challenges, even challenges that you can't envision, but you'll find new solutions that nobody can even imagine.
0233	Donald Trump	Among your ranks is the next Chester Nimitz, the next Grace Hopper, the next John Lejeune.
0234	Donald Trump	Future generations will talk about you.
0235	Donald Trump	They will tell your stories, speak of your courage, and someone many years from now will be standing right here, in my position, paying tribute to your great service.
0236	Donald Trump	It will happen.
0237	Donald Trump	Because you already know the keys to success.
0238	Donald Trump	You know that as long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, we will not fail.
0239	Donald Trump	We will not fail.
0240	Donald Trump	We cannot fail.
0241	Donald Trump	We will always succeed, always.
0242	Donald Trump	As long as we are united with the same mission, the same purpose, the same patriotic heart, we will win, because we are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
0243	Donald Trump	Together we struggle.
0244	Donald Trump	Together we strive.
0245	Donald Trump	Together we pray.
0246	Donald Trump	And together we triumph as citizens, as patriots, as Americans.
0247	Donald Trump	We stand on the shoulders of heroes who gave their sweat, their blood, their tears, and their very lives for this great country of ours.
0248	Donald Trump	This is our heritage.
0249	Donald Trump	This is our home.
0250	Donald Trump	And this is our pledge.
0251	Donald Trump	We are all in for America, like never before.
0252	Donald Trump	We are all in for our great country.
0253	Donald Trump	So to the Naval Academy of the class of 2018, I say a number of things.
0254	Donald Trump	Number one, I say that I was given an option.
0255	Donald Trump	I could make this commencement address, which is a great honor for me, and immediately leave and wave goodbye, or I could stay and shake hands with just the top 100, or I could stay for hours and shake hands with 1,100 and something.
0256	Donald Trump	What should I do?
0257	Donald Trump	What should I do?
0258	Donald Trump	I'll stay.
0259	Donald Trump	I'll stay.
0260	Donald Trump	I will stay.
0261	Donald Trump	But to the class of 2018, I do say strive for excellence.
0262	Donald Trump	Live for adventure.
0263	Donald Trump	Think big.
0264	Donald Trump	Dream bigger.
0265	Donald Trump	Push further.
0266	Donald Trump	Sail faster.
0267	Donald Trump	Fly higher.
0268	Donald Trump	And never, ever stop reaching for greatness.
0269	Donald Trump	Never stop reaching for the stars.
0270	Donald Trump	You know you're up to the task.
0271	Donald Trump	You're among the finest people anywhere in the world, the smartest, the strongest.
0272	Donald Trump	You know you will make us proud.
0273	Donald Trump	We know that glory will be yours because you are winners.
0274	Donald Trump	You are warriors.
0275	Donald Trump	You are fighters.
0276	Donald Trump	You are champions, and you will lead us only to victory.
0277	Donald Trump	Good luck.
0278	Donald Trump	May god be with you.
0279	Donald Trump	God bless America, and anchors away.
