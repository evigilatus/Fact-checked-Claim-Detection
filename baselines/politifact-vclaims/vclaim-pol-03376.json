Spicer\u2019s correct that this is more than every president going back about 70 years.\nHowever, this isn\u2019t a perfect measure \u2014 primarily because not all bills are created equal. None of the bills Trump has signed into law are particularly significant.\nThe numbers\nTruman signed 55 bills in his first 100 days after his 1948 election. (Truman first became president in 1945, when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in office. So we\u2019re starting with the first 100 days of Truman\u2019s first full term.)\nNo president since Truman has signed as many bills in his first 100 days, according to data from GovTrack and research by political scientists John Frendreis, Raymond Tatalovich and Jon Schaff.\nThe next highest after Trump, who has signed 28 bills, was John F. Kennedy, who signed 26. The lowest was George W. Bush, who signed seven.\nNo president comes close to Roosevelt, who began the tradition of marking the first 100 days. He signed 76.\n\nNote on the chart: For presidents Jimmy Carter through Trump, we did our own count using GovTrack. For earlier presidents, we used data confirmed by Frendreis, a political science professor at Loyola University Chicago. For Lyndon Johnson and Truman, who both came into office to replace a president midterm, we used the first 100 days after their re-election. We left out Gerald Ford because he did not serve a full term.\nOf the post-Truman presidents, Trump is \"fairly typical\" in terms of the number of bills signed so far, Frendreis said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bills\nSpicer says that Trump has shepherded these bills through Congress. However,\u00a0the 28 bills aren\u2019t very significant and don\u2019t appear to have required vote whipping from the White House.\nFor example, three bills appoint individuals to the Smithsonian Institution board, two name buildings, and one designates a location for a National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial.\nThe most notable bills Trump has signed are a set of 13 that reverse Obama-era regulations on a range of issues including on internet privacy and gun control. While that was a goal for Republican lawmakers, it\u2019s important to note these bills made it to Trump\u2019s desk through a process made possible by the Congressional Review Act, which became law in 1996. The act gives Congress a narrow window to reverse regulations, so these 13 bills had to get through Congress within Trump\u2019s first 100 days.\nNotably missing from the list of 28 bills that have reached his desk: A bill repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, along with several other laws Trump said he would try to usher through Congress within his first 100 days.\nCompare this to President Barack Obama, who signed 14 laws, but those laws included the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the $800 billion stimulus package.\nOr Roosevelt, who within 100 days signed 15 major bills including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed bills that legalized the manufacture and sale of beer and wine and established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority.\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect badly on Trump. Generally speaking, it\u2019s rare for a president to sign major legislation in his first 100 days, Frendreis said. \"Outsider\" presidents like Trump, in particular, need time to learn how to navigate the lawmaking process in Washington, and major legislation doesn\u2019t move through Congress quickly.\nThe first 100 days is \"not necessarily an accurate reflection of how effective a president is going to be in leading Congress,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nSpicer said Trump has \"worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman.\"\nIn the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills. The president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28.\nNone of the bills Trump has signed so far are major pieces of legislation, so it doesn\u2019t indicate that Trump has been particularly skilled at getting his agenda through Congress so far.\nWe rate Spicer\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-04-27 16:21:12 UTC   Politifact    2 1 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  Trump has \"worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman.\"    Sean Spicer White House press secretary   daily press briefing Tuesday, April 25, 2017 2017-04-25    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03376"}
