Yet on Nov. 15, 2011, she hit the brakes: Texas would not disburse $25 million in advance of the first race, she announced.\n\nWe put her statement through PolitiFact\u2019s Flip-O-Meter. Did Combs do a high-speed turn?\n\nCombs\u2019 statement says she has supported bringing a Formula One race to Texas \"since 2008.\" And when the deal became public in May 2010, Gov. Rick Perry praised her efforts. In the 2010-11 budget, approved in 2009, lawmakers sent $25 million to Combs to be placed in the Major Events Trust Fund, whence she could distribute the money under the terms of a 2003 statute.\n\nCombs\u2019 agreement to pay in advance was spelled out in a May 10, 2010, letter:\n\n\"With the understanding that the first Formula 1 United States Grand Prix race will be held in Texas in 2012, full funding on the entire sanction for 2012 will be paid to Formula OneWorld Championship Limited (\u2018FOWC\u2019) no later than July 31st, 2011.\"\n\nThe sanction, reported by the Statesman to be $25 million under the original contract, is the first of ten $25 million annual payments Texas committed to in writing. Payment was delayed when Austin\u2019s race date was put back from June 17, 2012, to Nov. 18, 2012.\n\nBut Combs\u2019 Nov. 15 statement was the first official notice that Texas would not pay until after the race was held. It unequivocally says, \"The state of Texas will not be paying any funds in advance of the event.\"\n\nDoes her announcement constitute a flip flop?\n\nCombs says no. Specifically, Combs spokeswoman Brooke Botello told us, \"It is not a change of position; rather, it\u2019s adhering to the statute.\"\n\n\"The ability to advance funds, according to the statute, is discretionary,\" Botello emailed us Nov. 22. \"Considering the events of late, we used that discretion and decided \u2013 due to the events outlined in the attached \u2013 it would not be prudent to advance the funds.\"\n\nIn the attachment Botello mentions, which is Combs\u2019 Nov. 15 statement, the comptroller lists the recently announced Formula One race in New Jersey, set for 2013; slowed construction at the Central Texas site; and disagreements between Formula One and race promoters that \"prompted speculation about whether the Austin race will even occur.\"\n\nOur ruling: Combs may have been justified in her recent statement that no state money would go to the race in advance. Still, it\u2019s a reversal of her earlier promise. This is a Full Flop.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12031"}
