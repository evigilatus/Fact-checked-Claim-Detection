Control of Congress is in the balance. And there is a critical vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court.\nAppearing Feb. 22, 2016 on Megyn Kelly\u2019s Fox News show, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Janesville), said the problem is head-butting between the Republican-controlled Congress and Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\"We have this liberal president and conservative congress\" Ryan said, punching his fists together. \"It\u2019s not working.\"\n\"So you don\u2019t think anything can get done unless it\u2019s one party rule?\" Kelly asked.\n\"Look at the path we are on,\" Ryan replied. \"70 percent of Americans believe that we are on the wrong path.\"\nTo be sure, in a politically divided country, Republicans may think we are on the wrong path because of what Democrats are doing, and vice versa.\nBut that still seems like a high percentage of Americans thinking the country is headed in the wrong direction.\nIs Ryan right?\nDigging in\nWhen we asked for backup, Ryan\u2019s team pointed to the most recent Associated Press poll before Ryan\u2019s appearance the show, conducted between Feb. 11 and Feb. 15.\nThe AP-GfK poll is conducted online using a nationally representative sample of American adults recruited to take surveys. While the poll was conducted online, participants were found through address-based sampling to include people who do not have internet access.\nThe question about the country\u2019s direction is asked first on the AP poll. This means previous questions don\u2019t influence the response.\nOf the Americans polled in February, 68 percent said things in this country are generally heading in the wrong direction. That\u2019s just under Ryan\u2019s 70 percent figure.\nThe number was actually down from 74 percent in the previous poll, taken in December 2015.\nAnd for some time people have thought the country is headed in the wrong direction. For the last two years, 60 percent or more of those polled by AP-GfK have said the country is heading in the wrong direction. Here\u2019s a look at those numbers.\n\n\n\n\nDate of poll\n\n\nWrong direction percentage\n\n\n\n\nFeb. 11-15, 2016\n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\nDec. 3-7, 2015\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\nOct. 15-19, 2015\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\nJuly 9-13, 2015\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\nApril 23-27, 2015\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\nJan. 29 - Feb. 2, 2015\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\nDec. 4-8, 2014\n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\nJuly 24-28, 2014\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\nMay 16-19, 2014\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nInterestingly, the bleak outlook from respondents for the country doesn\u2019t seem to affect the outlook for their own families. In the same poll, 76 percent of respondents said things for their family were generally headed in the right direction.\nBut Ryan\u2019s staff cited a single poll.\nThe right direction-wrong direction is a common one in polling, so for comparison we took a look at Huffington Post Pollster. The feature compiles the reliable polls and tracks that data.\nPollster\u2019s Feb. 17, 2016 analysis found 64 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. The data shows that percentage has been hovering around 64 percent since October of 2015 and hasn\u2019t risen above 65 percent since 2012.\nBy this measure, the only time 70 percent of Americans said the country was on the wrong track was in October 2011.\n\n\nOur rating\nRyan said \"70 percent of Americans believe that we are on the wrong path.\"\nHis team backed up this statement with reliable poll results from the Associated Press. But many other polls reported a lower number, closer to 60 percent. What\u2019s more, the percent of Americans who think the country is on the wrong track has hovered above 60 percent for the last three years.\nThis statement is accurate but needs additional information or context. That\u2019s our definition of Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05230"}
