Sanders has pushed back, saying he only voted for the bill because of key safety provisions.\nThe Sanders campaign offered the defense when we asked about it in September and in a recent press release. But that doesn\u2019t add up, Meet the Press\u2019 Chuck Todd pointed out on Feb. 28.\n\"You said you supported the House version of crime bill because it had an assault weapons ban in it. But that turned out not to be the case,\" Todd said. \"So why did you put out a statement that was misleading?\"\n\"Woah, woah, woah,\" Sanders responded. \"No, that\u2019s not my understanding. My understanding is there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill.\"\n\"It was not in the House bill that you voted. It was in a Senate bill, but not the House bill,\" Todd countered.\n\"Hold it. To the best of my knowledge, there were two important provisions, and that is the Violence Against Women Act,\" Sanders said. \"And my understanding is there is a ban on assault weapons.\"\nSo who\u2019s right here?\nThe answer is complicated.\nSanders did vote in favor of a House conference report that included the aforementioned ban and protections for women. He also voted for a separate House bill specifically prohibiting assault weapons that was meant to be folded into the omnibus legislation.\nBut it\u2019s a stretch to say that Sanders supported the crime bill because of the assault weapons ban, so Todd is right that Sanders also okayed versions without the prohibitions.\nSanders and the crime bill\nThe crime bill underwent many iterations before it became law in August 1994. So it\u2019s not entirely clear if Sanders and Todd are talking about the same version.\nBut here\u2019s the bottom line. Sanders voted for at least one version\u00a0of the bill that didn\u2019t include the assault weapons ban -- undercutting his core claim.\nThe crime bill had a\u00a0circuitous path.\nIn 1991, Sanders opposed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1991 \u2014 an early version of the 1994 bill put forth by Jack Brooks, a Democrat from Texas and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\u00a0Though the bill passed in the House, it ultimately failed in the Senate.\nIn October 1993, Brooks tried again and\u00a0introduced the original Violent Crime and Control Law Enforcement Act of 1994. This version didn\u2019t include an assault weapons ban nor protections for women.\nIt passed in the House by a voice vote on Nov. 3, 1993, so it\u2019s unclear whether Sanders voted in favor. We found no evidence Sanders opposed the bill, and\u00a0in three roll call votes, Sanders, along with most Democrats, said \"aye\" to amendments that didn\u2019t include a ban.\nWhen the bill reached the Senate, it added provisions to ban assault weapons and protect women from crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence. This version passed in the Senate and returned to the House.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt that point, two things happened.\nFirst, Sanders criticized the crime bill for its lack of attention to root causes.\u00a0\"We can either educate or electrocute. We can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails. Mr. Speaker, let us create a society of hope and compassion, not one of hate and vengeance,\" he said on the House floor on April 13.\nSecond,\u00a0Brooks amended the bill again, this time stripping the legislation of\u00a0the assault weapons ban but keeping the violence against women provisions.\nSanders\u00a0voted for the bill without the gun ban.\nIn place of the ban, Brooks offered to create a commission to \"examine the extent to which assault weapons and high power firearms have contributed to violence and murder in the United States.\"\nThen the bill went back and forth between the two chambers for a few months, as a conference committee attempted to hash out the differences. Meanwhile, the assault weapons ban became a hot topic in the national debate, with three former presidents \u2014 Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan \u2014 writing a letter urging Congress to pass it.\nIn May, Sanders voted for a separate bill put forth by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer to ban 19 semi-automatic assault weapons, including AK-47s and Uzis as well as weapons with more than one assault feature. According to news reports from the time, passing this legislation paved the way for the compromise bill to encompass the ban.\nBrooks, the Texas Democrat described by the Washington Post as \"wily and contrary,\" attempted to keep the prohibitions out of the bill but to no avail. The House released its conference report in August 1994 with the ban in place. Sanders voted in agreement. \u00a0\nSanders on banning assault weapons\nOutside of the omnibus crime bill, the record shows that Sanders supported prohibiting assault weapons since his early days in office.\nIn 1990, the Miami Herald noted that Sanders had earned the backing of the gun community in his congressional bid over Republican Peter Smith, even though \"Sanders also supports federal limits on assault weapons.\"\nBut in 1994, his vote on the Schumer bill roused the ire of Vermont gun owners. Here\u2019s a passage from the Boston Globe to that point:\n\"Sanders, who always supported an assault weapons ban, joined Swett and Andrews in the 216-214 House majority to ban 19 types of semiautomatic guns \u2014 which require the trigger to be pulled each time the gun is fired but have high rates of fire and magazines that hold more than 10 cartridges.\n\u2018We're going to put our complete and entire effort to unseat him,\u2019 said Douglas Hoffman, president of a pro-gun group, the Sportsman's Alliance for Vermont's Environment, of Sanders.\"\nIn 1996, Sanders reconfirmed his support of the ban, voting to reject its appeal.\nOur ruling\nSanders says he voted for the 1994 crime bill because \"there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill.\"\nThere were many\u00a0votes surrounding the crime bill. The trouble with Sanders\u2019 claim is that his contention that he voted for the crime bill because of the assault weapons ban is at odds with votes for the bill that include no such ban.\nAs often with congressional votes, there is a lot of gray area to determining a legislator\u2019s motivations.\nWe rate Sanders\u2019 claim Half True.\n\u00a0\nShare The Facts\n\n\nBernie Sanders\nPresidential candidate\n\n\n \n\u00a0\nSays he supported the 1994 crime bill because \"there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill.\"\n\u00a0\nIn an interview on NBC's Meet the Press \u2013 Sunday, February 28, 2016\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmbed\n\n\n\nShare\nRead more", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05350"}
