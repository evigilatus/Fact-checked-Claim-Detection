Some have cheered it, while more than\u00a0half a million people\u00a0had signed a boycott petition by American Family Association, a conservative Christian activist group, as of Tuesday. The group contends the policy encourages sexual predators and puts women and young girls in danger.\nWe know the policy alone is controversial. But we wondered whether Target had taken its stance to an even more contentious level by installing urinals in a women\u2019s store restroom? That\u2019s the claim in the\u00a0popular Facebook post\u00a0by a user named Kathleen Crawford:\n\"It's true. ..I'm in the women's bathroom at a Target north of LA...they actually took out a stall for women in order to accommodate the ones who have giblets...yes, these are urinals...for men...and so the war on women progresses. \u2026\"\nThe allegation inspired outrage on some conservative\u00a0blogs, where it was taken as fact.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be.\nOur research\nThe Facebook post includes a photo of two urinals wrapped in plastic inside a restroom with a red wall. It shows no evidence of where, exactly, the photo was taken.\nWhen we contacted Target, a corporate spokeswoman called the claim on Facebook \"inaccurate.\"\n\"We have not made any changes to the restrooms,\" the spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said in an email. \"We have not added any urinals to any women's restrooms nor do we have any plans to do so.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the company never had past plans to do so.\nSo what\u2019s going on with the photo?\nIt\u2019s hard to say for certain.\nWe reached out to the person who posted it on Facebook, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe myth-busting website Snopes.com also\u00a0checked out\u00a0the Facebook post and found it False. It said the \"picture has\u00a0nothing to do with Target's restroom policy. The image was not taken in a women's restroom at a Los Angeles Target store (rather a men's room that was undergoing repair or refurbishment).\"\nSnopes.com did not say how it found out where the photo came from. Snyder, the\u00a0Target spokeswoman, said she did not know its source.\nIf Target had made this change, we\u2019d expect more than just one photo to surface.\nWe reached out to the woman on Facebook, and we'll add her response should we hear back.\nOur ruling\nA popular Facebook post alleged last week that Target installed urinals in a women\u2019s restroom in California.\nTarget representatives told us the claim is \"inaccurate,\" and that the company has no plans to change its restrooms, and never did. Best we can tell, the Facebook post is a one-off picture that hasn\u2019t surfaced in any other form (other than the thousands of people sharing it).\nSo stop that! This claim rates Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7fedb0b8-7b12-4278-affd-bd43717e7f7c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05046"}
