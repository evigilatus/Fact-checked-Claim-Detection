It turns out he\u2019s correct.\nThomas did not respond to requests for comment, but he likely got his statistics from a budget request that Lucian Niemeyer, assistant secretary of defense for energy, installations and environment, provided to the House Committee on Armed Services on April 18, 2018.\nNoting that the Department of Defense needs a steady flow of investment to keep its bases in good condition, Niemeyer requested more money for the 2019 fiscal year to compensate for low funding in past years.\n\"As a result of limited investments in previous budgets for facilities sustainment and recapitalization, 23 percent of the Department\u2019s facility inventory is in \u2018poor\u2019 condition \u2026 and another 9 percent is in \u2018failing\u2019 condition,\" Niemeyer said in prepared testimony.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
