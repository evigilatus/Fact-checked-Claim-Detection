Scott Walker, both Republicans, for their lack of truthfulness. But in the process, she distorted some facts of her own.\n\n\"Politifact listed Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin as the Governor who told the most lies,\" Weinberg wrote. \"Well not to be [outdone], our own \u2018untruthful\u2019 Governor Chris Christie made it into Politifact's top five of \u2018Lie - en Governors.\u2019 We\u2019re so proud Mr. Christie. \u00a0You should really put that accolade right under your \u2018Jersey Comeback\u2019 banner.\"\n\nThis claim surprised us: PolitiFact New Jersey never compiled such a list -- and neither did any of our fact-checking colleagues.\n\nSo what is Weinberg talking about?\n\nThe state senator\u2019s statement was based on a list posted on the liberal blog Uppity Wisconsin.\n\nThe list ranked governors fact-checked at least five times by PolitiFact by the percentage of True and Mostly True ratings they received.\n\nWalker had the lowest combined percentage of those two rulings, according to the June 1 blog post. The post concluded that \"Walker is the #1 most dishonest governor in America.\"\n\nChristie took fourth place among the \"top five most dishonest governors in America\" with 38 percent of his PolitiFact rulings earning True or Mostly True.\n\nThe blog\u2019s tally of percentages of True and Mostly True rulings for governors in its top five list was mostly accurate at the time, but there\u2019s several problems with the conclusions made from that data.\n\nPolitiFact Editor Bill Adair called suggestions that a governor is \"in the top five\" for falsehoods \"inaccurate -- and meaningless.\"\n\nOverall, PolitiFact has checked 22 sitting governors. Only 10 of those governors have faced the Truth-O-Meter at least five times.\n\nIn a pool of 10, it\u2019s not difficult to land a spot in the top five.\n\n\"It's fine if people want to use our report cards to compare the records of people we fact-check. But it's important to be accurate about what those report cards say and what they don't,\" Adair said. \"The report cards provide a tally of the claims we chose to check. But it's not accurate to say the report cards indicate who \u2018told the most lies.\u2019 We are journalists who choose our fact-checks based on what is newsworthy. We are not social scientists and are not using any kind of random sample to select statements to check.\"\n\nJason Butkowski, a spokesman for the New Jersey Senate Democrats, acknowledged Weinberg erred in citing PolitiFact as the source of the ranking, but, he said in an e-mail, \"that does not take away from the larger issue \u2013 that Governor Christie, who prides himself on his straight-talking Jersey guy demeanor, only scored truthful or mostly truthful an abysmal 38% of the time in the 37 statements analyzed by PolitiFact.\"\n\nObviously, PolitiFact doesn\u2019t track every statement, nor do they track every Governor on an even playing field, so issuing any kind of quantitative ranking of public officials based on PolitiFact\u2019s information doesn\u2019t work. \u00a0However, the people of New Jersey can, and should, expect more from Governor Christie when it comes to leveling with them on the big issues that matter most to our State.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nWeinberg claimed PolitiFact listed Walker as the governor \"who told the most lies\" and Christie made it into PolitiFact\u2019s \"top five of \u2018Lie - en Governors\u2019.\"\n\nWeinberg is wrong on both counts.\n\nPolitiFact never ranked governors by their falsehoods. Though PolitiFact breaks down ratings by percentages, those figures represent how an individual\u2019s statements have fared on the Truth-O-Meter. They do not show who \"told the most lies.\"\n\nWe rate Weinberg\u2019s claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
