In the previous afternoon, the Federal Government announced that the premiums for plans under the law would increase by an average of 22 per cent in 2017. While most planners will see an increase in their federal subsidies to mitigate higher premiums, the news has been an undesirable development for Democrats, especially in the last days of the election season. On CNN, Blitzer asked Wassman Schultz about picnics, said, \"That wasn't supposed to be, was it?\" She answered, \"Well, we're in a transitional year, and as I said, you have 91 percent of the previously uninsured Americans in Florida who are eligible for a tax discount, which reduces those costs. So these numbers are really an anomaly. It's four or five states where the number of insurance options has shrunk and the premiums have increased, but we'll be able to make sure that if we sit together and deal with the problems that have occurred with Obama. The part that has drawn our attention relates to the low number of insurance companies that provide policies under the Affordable Care Act, which is one of the factors driving the rise in premiums. Is Weserman Schultz right, \"it's four or five states where the number of insurance options has shrunk\"? In fact, it's more than that. Data published in the same report by the Ministry of Health and Human Services, which revealed an expected 22 per cent increase in premiums, showed that at least 29 states had fewer issues of plans in 2017 than in 2016 - much more than Warserman Schultz said. (The source is defined as a company offering insurance plans on the State Exchange.) Here is a list of States that are experiencing a decline in companies presenting plans under the Act between 2016 and 2017. In 2016, in 2017, the state's publications declined, 2016 to 2017, Alabama 3.2.2 Alaska 2.1.1 Arizona 8 2.4.6 Arkansas 5 4.1 California 12.11.1 Connecticut 4 2.2 Florida 10.7 Georgia 9 5.4 Illinois 9 5.4 Indiana 8.4 Kansas 4 3.1 Louisiana 5.4.1 By Madison Black: 2 February 2021 Massachusetts 11 10-1 Michigan 11 10-4 Minnesota 5 4-1 Mississippi 3-2-1 Missouri 7-4-3 Nebraska 3 2-1 Nebraska 4 2-2 New Jersey 6 3-3 Ohio 16 11-5 Oklahoma 2 1-1 Oregon 9 6-3 South Pennsylvania 13 8-5 South Carolina 4-1-3 Tennessee 4-3-1 Texas 19 10-9 Utah 4-3-1 Wisconsin 16 15-1 There has been no change in insurance companies submitting plans, there has been an increase in insurance companies, or there have been complications making comparisons difficult. Including all states for which data are available, the number of issuers decreased from 298 in 2016 to 228 in 2017, representing a decrease of approximately 23 per cent. At the national level, the number of insurance companies graduating from the State exceeded the number of insurance companies newly entering a State by a factor of more than 5 to 1. Jove Burgan, Press Secretary Loiserman Schultz, did not object that the number was higher than she said, instead arguing that \"while some states are experiencing a decline in insurance companies, nearly 80 per cent of market customers will be able to choose between competing insurers - a sharp contradiction to the time when the Affordable Care Act has already become law.\" Our reign and Asserman Schultz said, \"It's four or five states where the number of insurance options has decreased\" under the Affordable Care Act. According to official federal data, it's far away, because 29 states have seen fewer insurance options. We assess her statement wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cc846e0-1d46-443d-806c-c70ca2a785", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04050"}
