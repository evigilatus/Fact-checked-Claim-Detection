Elizabeth Warren takes it to another level.\nAn image of the Massachusetts senator recently appeared on Facebook, and attributes her to the following quote: \"If women need to be raped by Muslims to prove our tolerance, so be it. Then thank goodness for Planned Parenthood.\"\nThe words, \"this is why we cannot allow lawmakers like this to be re-elected,\" is also written across the image.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The meme appears to have been fabricated to solely spread misinformation and diminish Warren\u2019s credibility.\nOur ruling\nA\u00a0meme attempts to link Warren to an offensive quote that said \"If women need to be raped by muslims to prove our tolerance, so be it. Then thank goodness for Planned Parenthood.\"\nWarren did not say that and the quote appears to be entirely fabricated.
