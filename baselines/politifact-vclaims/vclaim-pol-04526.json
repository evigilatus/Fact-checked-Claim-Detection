I know she\u2019s given me no support, zero support, and yet I\u2019m leading her in the polls.\"\nDo the numbers bear that out? We took a closer look.\nOf course, the Republican businessman is running for president, not against Ayotte for Senate. But we interpreted his comment as saying he is having a better showing in polls in New Hampshire.\nTrump didn\u2019t name any specific polls in his interview, and his campaign did not provide source material or respond to a request for comment. So we looked at their favorability ratings among the state\u2019s voters, and also examined how tight their races are in New Hampshire.\nWe turned to RealClearPolitics.com, which tracks polling data and calculates an average of the most recent voter surveys.\nThe site\u2019s New Hampshire presidential polling average showed that on Aug. 2, when Trump made the comment, Democrat Hillary Clinton led the businessman in the state, 43.25 percent to 40.5 percent, a margin of nearly three percentage points.\nBy contrast, the RealClearPolitics.com polling average for the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race showed that Ayotte was virtually tied with Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan, 45.8 to 45.2 percent, on the same day.\nThose averages have since changed slightly. WBUR released a new poll two days after Trump\u2019s interview that showed both Democrats widening their leads in New Hampshire. Clinton led Trump by 15 percentage points, the new survey showed, while Hassan led Ayotte by 10.\nSo, not only is Trump not \"beating (Ayotte) in the polls by a lot,\" he\u2019s not beating her in the polls at all. Ayotte is doing better than Trump in New Hampshire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Kaine\n\n\nstated on January 2, 2011 in a TV interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s mid-term approval ratings are similar to other presidents who went on to re-election.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 10, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust to be extra careful, we also checked to see whether there was a period in which Trump was performing better against Clinton than Ayotte was against Hassan but couldn\u2019t find one in the RealClearPolitics.com archive.\nHow about favorability ratings, which show how warmly voters feel towards a candidate, rather than whether they would or would not vote for them in an election matchup?\nThe most recent WMUR Granite State Poll, released in late July, showed that Trump had a net favorability of negative 29 percent, while Ayotte scored a positive two percent net favorability rating. (Net favorability refers to the candidate\u2019s favorability score minus his or her unfavorability score.)\nSpecifically, the survey found 32 percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Trump, while 61 percent had an unfavorable opinion of the businessman. Six percent were neutral.\nAnd the poll showed that 42 percent of state voters had a favorable opinion of Ayotte, 40 percent had an unfavorable view, seven percent were neutral and 11 percent didn\u2019t know enough to say.\nThe WBUR poll, released on August 4 after Trump\u2019s comment, showed similar patterns. Twenty-nine percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Trump, it found, while 60 percent had an unfavorable opinion, with 10 percent are undecided.\nThe same poll showed 42 percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Ayotte, compared to 38 percent who had an unfavorable opinion. Sixteen percent were undecided and three percent hadn\u2019t heard of her or refused to answer.\nSo the two recent polls showed that Ayotte\u2019s favorability rating in the Granite State was far higher than Trump\u2019s.\nOur ruling\nTrump said he is beating Ayotte in the polls \"by a lot.\" However, Ayotte recent surveys have shown that New Hampshire voters view Ayotte more favorably than Trump. The polls also indicate that Ayotte is locked in a closer race against her Democratic challenger than Trump.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc62323e-c00c-4d16-92e8-219dc78509be", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04526"}
