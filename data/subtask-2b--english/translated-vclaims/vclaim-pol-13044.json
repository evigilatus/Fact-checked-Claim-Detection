He's running for president. Kane said it twice during his Saturday rally at the Centennial Olympic Park. And the videos on the big TV have repeated it. The celebration was all for the sake of a presidential bid. There were American flags. The red, white and blue balloons sailed in the air. A video of Cain, wearing a cowboy's hat and passing through a farm, recounting his humble upbringing. There was also a necessary reference to the words of our founding fathers: \"We do not need to rewrite the Constitution of the United States,\" Cain said. \"We need to reread the Constitution and enforce the Constitution.\" \"I know there are some people who won't do it. So, for the sake of those who won't read it because they don't want us to abide by the Constitution, there's a small section there talking about life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness. \"You know, those ideals we live in, we believe in, your parents believe in, When you get to the part about life and freedom and the pursuit of happiness, you don't stop there, and I keep reading. \"Because when he says that any form of government becomes destructive of those ideals, the people have the right to change or abolish them. We have some change and some cancellation to do.\" He has sent out how he can do your Christian word relating to Christian holy Christians. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness did not exist. We did a computer search of her text to confirm that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. :: Researcher of constitutional history and Professor Richard R. Beeman University came to help us by e-mail. This phrase is contained in the second preambular paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, which was written in 1776, 11 years before the Constitution was drafted during the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Beeman agreed with Cain that we did not need to rewrite the constitution and it was even more important for Americans to read it. \"It might be a good thing if Mr. Kane did this job,\" said Beeman. That language about abolishing the government? In paragraph 3 of the Declaration of Independence, he added that it was not in the Constitution. Excuse me. We asked Cain to respond to his campaign. One speaker said that he sometimes mentioned both the Constitution and the declaration of independence. \"All too often he refers to them together when he speaks of his appreciation for the work of our founders,\" she said. The language of the two documents can be easy for your average atmosphere to mix. However, the confusion between the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence is not a simple mistake, especially for a candidate for the post of President, and Donald E. Wilkes, Jr., a professor of law at the University of Georgia, said. The Declaration is a statement of beliefs. The Constitution is the supreme law of the country. \"There is no court making a legal decision based on the declaration of independence,\" Wilkes said. With his first speech as a well-intentioned candidate, Cain joined a long line, the two parties of presidential hope who surrendered to foot disease in the mouth. These include the enemies of Cain, President Barack Obama, who accidentally said that there were 57 states during the 2008 campaign and John McCain, who in an interview said that he was not sure how many houses he owned. Welcome to the 2012 presidential election season, guys. Kane's making a mistake. On January 22, 2021, Marco Rubio stated on Twitter that Joe Biden \"is published in such a short period of time, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone else.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13044"}
