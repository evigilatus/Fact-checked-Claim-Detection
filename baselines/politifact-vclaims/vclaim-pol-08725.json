As proof, he offered up specific claims including, \"Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months.\"\nPolitiFact wanted to know whether Obama\u2019s CEO statistic was accurate.\nThe White House pointed us to a recent Business Roundtable survey.\n\"Fifty percent of responding CEOs indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and the debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months,\" the report reads.\nOn its face, that\u2019s in line with what Obama said, but we wanted to see how Business Roundtable acquired their results. They would not disclose their exact question wording to us. Their report notes, \"Responses were received from 134 member CEOs, 63 percent of the total Business Roundtable membership.\" \nBusiness Roundtable\u2019s membership tends to be larger companies. Spokeswoman Amanda DeBard told us CEOs are invited based on revenue, industry and market capitalization, so it\u2019s safe to say the poll responses don\u2019t reflect a random sample of U.S. businesses.\nSince Obama often speaks to the Business Roundtable, we wanted to see what his relationship with the group was like. University of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis, who specializes in lobbying, said there\u2019s not much of a connection.\n\"Many of them have long-term relationships with government (simply because of their size and the government\u2019s size), but probably only a handful have any kind of even semi-close relationship with Obama,\" he said.\nWe ran the poll results by another business group, the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Senior policy analyst Holly Wade said she saw a similar sentiment among the smaller business owners that the federation represents.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Says Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In September, there were more small business owners that were feeling pessimistic about business conditions six months out,\" she said.\nThere wasn\u2019t much opinion voiced about delaying employment specifically, though. But Wade said that could be because small businesses were already hiring less during the economic recovery compared to bigger corporations.\nWhy would CEOs want to delay hiring?\nWith another possible debt ceiling default looming Feb. 7, University of Maryland finance professor David Kass said it\u2019s likely that a budget deal will lead to tighter fiscal policy, which would slow down the economy and cause CEOs to put off hiring decisions for a few months.\nAnother factor that would contribute to CEO anxiety is consumer behavior. While day-to-day spending probably won\u2019t change post-shutdown, consumers will likely postpone higher ticket purchases, like homes and cars.\n\"On the demand side, there\u2019s uncertainty on the consumers\u2019 part, which in turn will have an impact on CEOs,\" Kass said. \"They\u2019re trying to predict their future sales and what the environment will look like. It\u2019s a lose-lose situation for everyone.\"\nIn any case, Obama is trying to communicate that the shutdown had a significant financial impact on the nation, and he\u2019s not wrong there. Independent forecasts agree that the shutdown was a setback for the U.S. economy, though they differ on exact figures.\nOur ruling\nObama said 50 percent of CEOs are delaying hiring due to the shutdown, which accurately cites the results of a poll sponsored by the Business Roundtable. The survey\u2019s limited sampling, though, \u00a0means the responses aren\u2019t necessarily representative of all U.S. businesses.\nBut the idea that the shutdown affects how businesses think about hiring is more broadly applicable. Experts said it\u2019s reasonable that CEOs would be hesitant to hire, given that uncertainty about government fiscal policy can affect consumer confidence.
