Then there are links to stories with headlines like this one: \"NC Governor to stop all alcohol sales beginning Friday, April 3rd. Another one claims \"Gov.

However, Pennsylvania, where the state runs liquor stores, has closed down all of its off-premise locations indefinitely, Forbes reports. \"It remains the only part of the country where residents have such limited access to distilled spirits,\" the publication says.\nPeople in Pennsylvania can still buy alcohol, however. One distillery is selling bottles from a drive-thru and shipping to folks\u2019 front doors. Another shop is selling vodka and whiskey for curbside pickup. California, meanwhile, is among the states to loosen alcohol rules for restaurants, allowing them to sell beer, wine and cocktails to go as people are preventing from dining in due to shelter-in-place orders to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\u00a0\nWe rate these Facebook posts False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18224"}
