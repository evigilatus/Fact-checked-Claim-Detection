The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour, and the White House and some Democrats in Congress want to raise it to $10.10 per hour. As of December, the majority of Americans support an increase. On election day, voters in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota agreed to state-level increases to the minimum wage. ==History==Sen. Ben Cardin, D-MD, wants to see the minimum wage increase, and defended the idea in an interview on Fox News Sunday 2, 2014 \"Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen job growth, not job loss,\" said Cardin. The impact of the increases in the minimum wage on job growth is at the heart of this debate, so we asked whether the allegation of a cardinal is accurate. As you can see, the statements are inconclusive, and there is no consensus among experts - even among major economists. Because Cardin was talking about congressional work, we will focus on federal minimum wage increases and job growth across the country. We asked Cardin's employees and some economists, and we did some research around here, but there seems to be no published research specifically answering the question: Was there a growth in employment every year if Congress increased the minimum wage in the Federation? (There is much research that analyses individual years, states or industries.) We went to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Each year Congress has been increasing the minimum wage since 1978, considering the volume of employment that grew or contracted one year after the new wage came into effect. (The first federal minimum wage came into effect in 1938, but was not consistent among all industries until 1978. We know that this measure does not explain other economic factors or increases in the minimum wage at the State level. But we wanted to look at Cardin's claim as literally as possible before we moved on to the broader debate. The following table shows the years in which Congress raised the minimum wage, employment in the month in which the change began, employment a year later, as well as the number of months in which job growth took place. Employment - the actual date (in thousands) of employment - the following year (in thousands) months of overall job growth? On 9 January 2021 on Twitter, \"Not all women who lost jobs (in the December Business Report) were mostly black and Latin women. \u2022 15 January, 2021 4.25 108367 108 8 527 Yes 1996 4.75 12067 123 945 11 Yes 1997 5.15 123 604 126 775 Yes 2007 5.85 984 137 421 No 2008 655 137 421 617 0 No 2009 7.25 130 617 130 4 395 does not claim to be literally incorrect. Increasing the minimum wage at the federal level is not always followed by job growth at the national level, or loss. There were 12 months of strong job growth after the increase in 1978, but 12 months of job losses following the increase in 2008. These changes in the minimum wage have not occurred in a vacuum. The last three minimum wage increases (2007, 2008 and 2009) were followed by significant job losses, but all of this was taking place in the midst of the global financial crisis. Increases in the minimum wage occurred in the 1990s prior to job growth during an economic boom. So what do the experts say? The economy is divided around the impact of the minimum wage on job growth. There is some research that shows that raising the minimum wage has a negative impact on job growth, and much research that has a minimal impact. To find out how divided economists are, look at the University of Chicago survey. Researchers asked about 40 major economists if raising the federal minimum wage would make it \" markedly difficult for low-skilled workers to find a job.\" In response, 34 percent agreed to the statement, 32 percent disagreed, and 24 percent were uncertain. One of the most comprehensive reports of this debate comes from the Center for Economic and Political Research, a progressive think tank. The report concludes that \"the outcome of the best statistical evidence\" shows little impact on employment when the minimum wage rises. Those who say that raising the minimum wage leads to loss of employment generally follow the logic that when workers become more expensive, businesses will be less likely to hire them, followed by unemployment. David Newmark is an economist who has researched this issue and believes that raising the minimum wage reduces employment opportunities for low-skilled workers. However, he noted that the economy had grown in the long term, leading to job growth at all levels of wages and skills. \"The causes of growth, as well as the business cycle, the full swamp (increases to the minimum wage,\" said Newmark, Director of the Centre for Economics and Public Policy at the University of California Irvin. There are some other matters that should be kept in mind when it comes to increases in the minimum wage. First of all, it doesn't affect many. Only about 2.6% of all paid or paid workers in the United States receive a minimum wage or less than the federal minimum wage, according to the data of the Bureau of Labour Statistics 2013. In addition, the minimum wages in 23 states (and some municipalities) are higher than the minimum wage in the Federation. There is also the question of whether the minimum wage has actually increased. Yes, the price of posters is increasing, but these increases have not kept pace with inflation. The current minimum wage is a few dollars lower than in the late 1960s. This research scheme compares the minimum wage with 2013 dollars at unmodified levels. All of this means that the small minimum wage adjustments have historically had little impact on employment, as stated by David Glaicher, an economist at the University of Adlafi who carried out research in labour economics. \"Therefore there has been almost no significant increase in prices due to rising costs, or a significant increase in unemployment,\" said Glaicher. \"At the same time, there has not been so much increase in demand that there has been a significant increase in jobs.\" Our governor Cardin said, \"Every time we increase the minimum wage, we see job growth, not job loss.\" We have looked at employment data nationwide in the years following the increases in the minimum wage since 1978, and sometimes there has been growth in jobs, and sometimes there has been a loss of jobs. Recent research tends to show that raising the minimum wage does not have a significant impact - positive or negative - on employment. Cardin was withdrawn when he said that the increase in the minimum wage was always followed by job growth. We assess his claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07029"}
