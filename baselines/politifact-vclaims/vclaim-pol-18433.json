His tweet includes a video that shows two people standing at a doorway and telling a third person that he cannot go in. \"You are not letting me in?\" the man asks the couple. \"No,\" they replied.\n\"I have a city-wide watcher\u2019s certificate,\" the man starts saying.\n\"It\u2019s not for this location,\" a woman at the door tells him. The man seeking entry tells the couple that the certificate says it\u2019s \"good in every ward and division in the city.\"\nThe 33-second video, which has been viewed more than 2.3 million times, ends with the man remaining outside.\nChamberlain\u2019s tweet was retweeted by Mike Roman, director of Election Day operations for President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. \"DEMOCRAT ELECTION OFFICIALS BANNING TRUMP POLL WATCHERS IN PHILLY. This is happening all over the City. The steal is on!\" Roman tweeted.\nKevin Feeley, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia City Commissioners, which is in charge of elections in the city, told PolitiFact that what happened in the video was \"a mistake\" on behalf of the people running the polling site.\n\"It was a misunderstanding of the law,\" Feeley said. However, the man eventually went to another polling site, where staff who better understood the law let him inside, Feeley said.\nFeeley said this is what happened: the poll watcher went to a polling site in Philadelphia this morning, but the judge of election (the person who runs that particular polling place) thought that the watcher could not be let into that particular location, because a ward and division number on the watcher\u2019s certificate did not correspond with that site. That used to be an old rule \u2014 that a watcher could only be admitted to a specific ward and division.\n\"That is no longer the law,\" Feeley said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judge of election was eventually told the watcher could be admitted into that location. \"We corrected the problem with the judge of election, we addressed it,\" Feeley said.\nFeeley said that the poll watcher left the site shown in the video and went to another site, \"and the judge there correctly understood the law and (the poll watcher) was admitted into that site.\"\n\"We regret that it happened, it was an honest mistake,\" Feeley said. \"It appears to be the only mistake of its kind.\"\nChamberlain in a follow-up tweet posted a picture that he said showed the poll watcher\u2019s certificate. The picture says that the watcher\u2019s name is \"Gary Feldman,\" representing Trump.\nThe picture of the certificate does not include any other identifying information. PolitiFact was unable to reach Feldman to confirm if he was the person in the video and whether he was able to enter another site as a poll watcher.\nOur ruling\nTweets claimed that poll watchers in Philadelphia were prevented from entering polling places.\nA poll watcher was denied access to one polling site in Philadelphia because the person in charge of that particular polling place was not up to date on the law, which allows watchers to enter any site, not just the ward and division site specified on the watcher\u2019s certificate, said Feeley, a spokesperson for Philadelphia City Commissioners. The same poll watcher went to another site and was allowed to go in, according to Feeley.\nFeeley said that the judge of election who had inaccurate information was updated on the new rules, and that there is \"no evidence that it was a systemic problem.\"\nThe posts are partially accurate but leave out important details or take things out of context.
