Scott Walker promises another stop in New York University schools. And now in the last weeks of facing the re-election with the Democratic Mary Burke, the first Republican to blame her for previous school increases. \"With two sons in college, I know how hard it is to pay for school,\" says Walker in a television commercial released in October 20, 2014. \"That's why we froze education on the campus. I want to freeze it again in my next term. Support for policy opponents that have increased education by 18%.\" In the campaign, Burke said she wanted to freeze education -- but only if more aid could go to the University of Wisconsin system at the same time. She stressed greater income tax reductions for education and refinancing of student loans. But, looking back, is the Governor right about Burke's support for policies that led to an 18 per cent increase? Let's go over the books. The Declaration itself does not mention any footnote as evidence of 18 per cent and does not mention any specific policies supported by Burke, who served as head of the State Ministry of Commerce under the Government. Jim Doyle from 2005 to 2007. A news release of the Walker advertising campaign simply presents the date of US education increases approved in state budgets up to 1967 and Burke's statement to a journalist in April 2005 that it supports Doyle's positions \"fully.\" A spokesperson for the election campaign referred to Burke &apos; s general praise for two Doyle budgets while working in the state government. None of this makes any direct connection between Burke and the tuition increases. This is not surprising, since Burke &apos; s job was to grant and track government assistance to businesses, not to administer the UW system, which determines education rates in conjunction with legislators and the Governor. We've been looking into the news since then, and we haven't found statements from Burke about raising tuition fees. In 2007, she commended Doyle &apos; s investment in the budget to increase financial aid to help families better afford college costs. More broadly, Burke promoted Doyle's total budget for 2007-2009 as \"a smart and responsible budget for the business in Wisconsin,\" which is \"financially responsible, sets our priorities for success, invests in those priorities,\" while it includes \"more than a dozen separate tax cuts, and saves taxpayers and businesses from $1.7 billion in Wisconsin.\" Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, History of Education. Education rates jumped 18% in its first year, and 15% in its second year. But that was in the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 academic years - before Burke arrived. Thereafter, increases ranged from 0 per cent to 9.3 per cent, depending on the year and whether it was a four- or two-year school, UW-Midison or UW-Milwaukee. Increases have been set at approximately 5 per cent for several years. When Doyle took office, education on UW-Madison campus in the system amounted to $3,854. When he left in 2010, it was $7,933. If you look specifically at the time of Burke in the state government, the tuition fees rose by 19 per cent in those three years, with some differences for different UW universities. Under Walker &apos; s rule, tuition fees increased by 11 per cent over the first two years and were frozen in 2013-2014 and 2014-15. The difference -- and it's big -- is that Walker directly controls those changes while Burke has little or nothing to do with them. We've been here before. In March 2014, we estimated that the Republican Party in Wisconsin claimed that the Burke budget in 2007-2009 contained a series of tax increases. We concluded that responsibility for the State budget and the thousands of appropriations allocated to it lay outside the rule with the appointed Secretary of the Council of Ministers. Similarly, it would be wrong to blame a secretary for spending changes in another department. Our evaluation of Walker said, \"Competitions to support policies that have increased education by 18%.\" Burke was in the state government when it happened, but Walker didn't provide any evidence that she supported the fee increases, except that Burke commended her boss while she was going to work for Doyle. We assess his claim is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07078"}
