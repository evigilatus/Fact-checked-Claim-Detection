Trump claimed that there were \"a million\" illegal votes in the 2016 presidential election. \"Take a look at judicial oversight. Take a look at their settlement. California recognized a million votes. They admitted a million votes, \"Trump Chuck Todd, the host of the program, said in an interview broadcast on June 23, 2019. The election officials and fact-checkers have already made unfounded allegations on this subject. In November 2016, Polyte Fact National classified the pants on fire, claiming to have lost the popular vote because \"millions of people voted illegally.\" Polly Fuckett gave California the same assessment for calling it \"serious voter fraud\" in California. Hillary Clinton won the state over 4 million votes and won the national popular vote by about 2.8 million votes. Trump won the crucial outcome of the Electoral College. We wanted to know the validity of Trump's new claim. So, we examined the settlement that he said was evidence of large-scale voter fraud in California. Here's the trade between Trump and Chuck Todd: \"You didn't like the fact that you lost the popular vote. That bothered you, didn't it?\" Trump: \"Well, I think it was -- I mean, I'm gonna say something, again, controversial. There were so many voices I didn't believe. Look at California.\" Todd: \"Mr. \"The President.\" Trump: \"Excuse me.\" Todd: \"But this...\" Trump: \"Look at judicial oversight. Take a look at their settlement. California recognized a million votes. \"Acknowledge a million votes.\" Todd: \"A million votes from what?\" Trump: \"Take a look at the judge... Todd: \"What are you talking about?\" Trump: \"The Judicial Supervision Authority has made a settlement. There was... \"Todd: \"What about?\" Trump: \"There was a lot of illegal voting.\" President Trump claimed that there was evidence to support his claim repeatedly that \"serious voter fraud\" took place in California during the 2016 presidential election. On January 28, 2021 in Facebook blog, bloggers tried to \"close\" the California government's summoning campaign. \u2219 (Gavin Newsom) By Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2012, our research in Tramp cited a settlement in January that arrived in California with the conservative group Judicial Control. It requires electoral officials in the Los Angeles district to remove inactive registrations from the voters &apos; lists in order to comply with federal law. However, the 20-page settlement document indicates that all parties have agreed not to recognize responsibility or fault by the State or province. It does not refer to voter fraud or illegal voting. In a written statement, the California Foreign Minister, Alex Padilla, carried out the new Trump allegation. Padilla, a democracy, also criticized the President &apos; s past statements on voter fraud. \"Whatever it is repeated, Trump's lies about voter fraud are manifestly incorrect. Specifically, the settlement with judicial supervision, L.A. County, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs do not contain any confession or evidence of \"illegal votes.\" The President &apos; s allegations are incorrect and other distortions aimed at undermining confidence in our elections. The settlement was clear and simple, and California will continue its work to adhere to modern procedures for keeping the list under the national voter registration law. California election officials have worked and will continue to work to achieve the objectives of the national voter registration law: to maintain the accuracy of the voters &apos; lists and to increase the number of citizens eligible for registration and voting. \"The agreement is on keeping voter registration records and interpreting federal law, not on votes cast in any election.\" In a press release last week, the Judicial Monitoring Authority said that the LA district \"has sent notices to up to 1.59 million inactive voters on its voters' lists - a step towards removing the names of voters who have moved or died, or who are otherwise ineligible to vote.\" Logan, District Election Officer, confirmed that the notices had been sent. In January, Associated Press published a report on the agreement, describing it as a settlement on \"old voter registrations,\" rather than on illegal voting. In the article, Paul Mitchell of the non-partisan political research company Data Inc. described the case as trivial because it involved inactive voters \"who do not receive voting materials, they do not vote, they do not appear in constituencies.\" \"What they say is that LA County keeps a large number of inactive recordings,\" said AP. \"This whole thing does nothing to clean up the active voters file.\" Mitchell came to verify this fact, claiming Trump's claim to be \"totally inaccurate.\" The White House did not respond to a request for information in support of the President &apos; s claim. Nor did the supervisory body respond. The head of the group, Tom Feyton, on Twitter and in AP's article, described it as an attempt to \"clean up\" the state's electoral lists. Our President, Governor Trump, recently announced that California was \"accepted\" there was an \"million\" illegal vote in the 2016 presidential election, in an attempt to support his widely exposed claim about the massive fraud of voters in the state. Trump cited January reconciliations between the state and judicial control. However, this agreement makes no mention of voter fraud or illegal voting. Instead, electoral officials in the L.A. district need to begin the process of removing inactive registrations, for those who have spent years without a vote often because of their movement or death, in compliance with federal law. It states that all parties have agreed not to recognize responsibility or fault by the State or province. The state and district election officials strongly rejected the President &apos; s statement. We found Trump's new allegation of forgery to be as unfounded as his previous allegations. We evaluate it with pants on fire.
