North Carolina has participated in the programme since 1970, but it is one of 17 states that has not expanded its coverage in recent years. (Joff) Roy Cooper and others say that the expansion of Medicaid will provide coverage for hundreds of thousands of North Carolines. According to Cooper, tens of thousands of veterans. \"It's embarrassing that 30,000 veterans in North Carolina do not have health insurance and if we expand Medikid 23,000 of them will,\" said Cooper in an interview with the news and watcher posted on Twitter. Cooper is not the first democracy in North Carolina to make this allegation. In September, the State Senate candidate JD Wooten made a similar statement in a video of the election campaign. \"My competitor, Rick Gunn, preventing the expansion of Medicaid -- cost half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans,\" said Wooten in commenting with the video. In the Wooten case, did Gunn vote to ban the Medicaid expansion bill? Did that vote prevent 500,000 people from receiving health insurance? Were there 23,000 veterans among those affected? Before the valuation of the claim, it is often correct. With this in mind, let us focus on the first part of Cooper's claim. Is it true that 30,000 veterans are without health insurance? Polyte Fact was unable to find statistics for 2018, 2017 or 2016. The United States Department of Veterans' Affairs does not track the number of uninsured veterans. However, we found reliable data in 2015 and 2014. Based on these reports, Cooper's assessment seems to be in place. In its book on the studies contacted by Politi Fukte, Cooper's office cited one of the same sources mentioned in the Wooten fact-finding study: a study conducted in 2016 on the effects of the Affordable Care Act on veterans. The study was conducted by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a non-profit charity focused on health care; and the Urban Institute, a think tank that examines the effects of economic and social policies. (When the Ministry of Health and Human Services contacted Bolift Fakt, she also cited this report of the Urban Institute. According to Chris McKay, the director of communications in the department, the Ministry of Health and National Security does not track down uninsured veterans. According to the study, there were 30,000 uninsured veterans in North Carolina in 2014. It reached 43,000 in 2013. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2219 On February 1, 2012, Cooper's office cited a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading health-care research body, published in 2015. North Carolina was home to 26,680 uninsured veterans in 2015, according to a map in Kaiser &apos; s report on Medicaid &apos; s role in the coverage of veterans. According to Craig Balowski, the Director of Communications of Kaiser, the chart represents the latest estimates of Kaiser. Therefore, the number of Coopers seems reasonable. The number of uninsured veterans could have fluctuated since 2015. However, the available estimates place its claim on the money, or within 3,320 veterans. Who's not insured? Don't all veterans have insurance through the army or the army? Not necessarily. Unless the veterans have been dishonorably discharged, the VA site says that most of them are eligible for some kind of coverage. There are variables that determine the extent of veterans &apos; coverage. However, most of those who served at least 24 months continuously after recruitment in September 1980 or entry into active service in October 1981 are eligible for some type of coverage. However, there are many other considerations. In 2016, some 510,000 veterans lacked insurance, according to the United States Census Bureau. The eligibility of the health-care system for health care is based on the status of veterans, the state of disability associated with service, the level of income and other factors. Furthermore, not all qualified VA veterans are actually used in their health care, and some may not realize that they are eligible for VA health care.\" The Census Bureau wrote in a report published in 2017. The Census Bureau also found that the number of low-income veterans in the Medicaid programme increased between 2013 and 2016. \"From 2013 to 2016, the percentage of veterans of working age who have received medical assistance increased more than others who live in poverty. The number of veterans of working age with Medicaid has also increased during this period,\" according to the Office. The Veterans Act states that veterans with questions can contact the Health Benefits Help Phone from 1 to 877 222-8387, Monday to Friday between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Colling Cooper said 30,000 veterans in North Carolina don't have health insurance. Polyte Fact does not know how many veterans lack health insurance in 2019. While we hope that Cooper has used the word \"estimation\" in his statement, his claim is very close to the estimates by two well-known organizations. One group said that there were 30,000 in 2014 and the other said that there were about 26,600 in 2015. These numbers are likely to have fluctuated since then. With that in mind, we often assess this claim as true.
