But a recent blog post misrepresents his statements about recovering from the current crisis.\u00a0\nThe headline of an April 9 blog post on the website Pulpit & Pen says: \"Church services can\u2019t resume until we\u2019re all vaccinated, says Bill Gates.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe blog goes on to say that \"Gates now argues that \u2018mass gatherings\u2019 (churches) will not meet again until a vaccine is found and everyone is vaccinated.\"\u00a0\nThe post links to an April 2 story on MyNorthwest.com about an interview Gates gave to \"CBS This Morning.\" In the interview, according to CBS, Gates called for a nationwide social isolation policy to slow the pandemic\u2019s spread.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019ll help everyone get out of this more quickly and reduce the deaths and reduce the economic reduction,\" Gates said, \"if we implement these strong isolation measures on a countrywide basis.\"\nWe listened to the nearly 30-minute interview and we didn\u2019t hear Gates mention churches. Rather, he says that the government needs to prioritize testing, and talks about when a vaccine could be ready for COVID-19 and when communities could open back up. He said that he expects that by the end of April some regions will see the number of COVID-19 cases plateau and then decrease.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We understand what needs to be done here, it\u2019s going to be very painful, but taking the pain early means there\u2019s a lot less pain both medically and economically than if we dilly-dally and wait until every town has big numbers before we react,\" he said.\u00a0\nHe then speculated about what opening up would look like.\u00a0\n\"Which activities have, like schools, have such benefit and can be done in a way that the risk of transmission is very low? And which activities like mass gatherings may be, in a certain sense, more optional. And so until you\u2019re widely vaccinated, those may not come back at all,\" he said.\nWhen \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Anthony Mason asked Gates if life will ever be the same, Gates said, \"not for some time.\"\u00a0\nWhat he doesn\u2019t say? That church services can\u2019t resume until we\u2019re all vaccinated.\u00a0\nConsidering what the world will look like as regions slow the spread of the coronavirus and people start to resume their lives, Gates suggests that some mass gatherings may not come back before enough people have been vaccinated against COVID-19.\u00a0\nBut Gates doesn\u2019t specify that this means \"church\" gatherings, nor does he have any power to forbid church services \"until we\u2019re all vaccinated,\" as the post says. In the interview he mentions talking to pharmaceutical companies and federal agencies about how to collaborate on a vaccine, but he doesn\u2019t imply that he has control over what policies the government could adopt with respect to such gatherings.\nWe rate this blog headline False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16919"}
