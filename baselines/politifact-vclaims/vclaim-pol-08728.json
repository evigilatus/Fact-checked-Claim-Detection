The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in all states learn the same academic concepts. President Barack Obama's administration has used its education funding grant process, Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core.\nFlorida is one of the states that approved Common Core. Amid backlash, the state Board of Education voted on Oct. 15 not to adopt reading or writing samples associated with the new national benchmarks \u00a0-- though local school districts can still choose to do so.\nCommon Core is about standards: the knowledge and skills students are required to have in each grade, from kindergarten through high school, not the curriculum schools use to teach those standards. \u00a0\nFlorida\u2019s Next Generation Sunshine State Standards include general information about the U.S. political system. It also includes the world's major religions in the World History section.\nAll curriculum decisions are made locally by schools boards, schools and teachers, according to the state Department of Education.\nWe read nothing in the standards that suggested that any level of government was telling students what political or religious beliefs they should personally hold.\nSo what evidence do the critics have for saying the Common Core will instill political and religious beliefs?\nThe Florida Stop Common Core Coalition cited a report written by Education Liberty Watch. The co-authors were Dr. Karen Effrem, President of Education Liberty Watch in Minnesota and a co-founder of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition, and Randy Osborne, a political consultant who has worked on the campaigns of several conservative candidates and causes, including the Florida marriage amendment.\nThe report zeroes in on something called the National Education Data Model, which lists hundreds of data elements. The report linked to a screen grab it created of those data elements.\nThe list shown includes \"voting status\" and \"religious consideration\" and \"religious affiliation.\" (It also includes far more mundane elements such as a student\u2019s birthdate, address and race.) These are elements that districts could choose to collect on any individual in the district: students, parents or teachers.\nWe could not find the same list of attributes on the NEDM website, but we shared it with officials involved with NEDM and they didn\u2019t dispute it.\nBut there are some major caveats about this list of data elements. First, this is not a required list of data for all states or school districts to collect. Instead, it is a voluntary model that states can use to organize student data that they already collect, said Jack Buckley, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. That means states or districts could choose to use some of the data elements and not others, or ignore the data model entirely.\nHelping states or districts organize their data is something that the feds have done for many years, long before Common Core, he said.\nBuckley said that federal officials did not come up with these potential elements out of thin air -- they were chosen because certain school districts or states had sought that particular data element in the past.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Remember this is all voluntary,\" Buckley said. \"If your state already collects this, or has a reason why it collects it, (then we tell them) \u2018here is how we recommend you code it\u2019 so everyone doesn\u2019t invent their own code for religions.\u2019\"\nWe interviewed Alexander Jackl, chief architect Choice Solutions, Inc., an education data software company and one of the original authors of the National Education Data Model. Jackl is also a member of a working group about the newer version -- the Common Education Data Standards, or CEDS.\nThe data fields for religion in particular are useful for private, religious schools, he said.\nThose fields \"are in the NEDM conceptual model as possible attributes,\" Jackl told PolitiFact in an email. \"This makes sense as parochial schools and religious universities might make use of NEDM as well and those elements would be useful for them. It looks, though, like they were not carried forward into CEDS.\"\nWe contacted a few school districts in Florida to ask if they collect data on voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliations, or if they plan to start doing that with Common Core.\nHere\u2019s the response we received from a spokesman for Miami-Dade schools: \"No. No. No. And no.\" Broward, Hillsborough and Pasco schools also don\u2019t collect that data.\n\"I can\u2019t think of any useful or legitimate educational reason to know that information,\" said Linda Cobbe, Pasco schools spokeswoman.\nThe Florida Department of Education does not require school districts to ask about voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliation and has no plan to do so under Common Core, department spokeswoman Cheryl Etters said.\nFears have become widespread\nClaims that Common Core will lead to collecting data about students religious or political beliefs have been repeated by conservative pundits.\nIn Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal signed an executive order in May to prohibit the state from collecting certain information about students and their families, including religious and political affiliation and voting history. A similar bill was recently introduced in the Michigan house.\nIn response to questions from parents, the Arizona state superintendent of public instruction distributed a fact-sheet that states: \"Will the system track a family's political affiliations or firearms ownership? Absolutely not.\"\nAlso, there is a clear difference between a state or a school district choosing to ask students about their voting status or religious affiliation and, as the report suggests, and using Common Core as a way to \"instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs.\"\nEffrem sent us an email arguing that the Common Core standards are intended \"to teach and instill non-cognitive/psychological/socioemotional attitudes.\" She cited an example of a lesson in Utah in which \"students use their voices to advocate solutions to social problems that they care deeply about\" and a middle school in Florida that apparently took a Junior Scholastic quiz called \"what kind of party animal are you?\"\nBut nothing we saw in Effrem\u2019s email proved that as a result of Common Core the federal government is trying to instill particular religious or political beliefs in students.\nAdditionally, we found nothing in either of the data models to suggest that the federal government is telling students what political or religious beliefs they should hold. For public schools, it wouldn\u2019t be constitutional, anyway.\nOur ruling\nThe goal of Common Core \"is not simply to improve academic achievement but also to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs,\" said an anti-Common Core group.\nTheir evidence, though, is flimsy at best: A computer model that has a data field for voting status or religion, which would typically be used by a private school. We could find no public schools that kept such data, and Florida Department of Education has no plans to require that they do. That\u2019s a far cry from attempting to instill particular religious or political beliefs.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08728"}
