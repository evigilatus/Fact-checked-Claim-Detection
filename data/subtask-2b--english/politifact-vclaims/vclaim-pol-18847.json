Later that night, Trump told Fox News, \"Portland's been burning for many years, for decades it's been burning.\"\n\nLocal authorities and journalists disputed both claims.\n\"We are not on fire. We have not been on fire,\" said Lt. Rich Chatman, a spokesperson for Portland Fire & Rescue, adding that there has been \"a steady and remarkable decline in the number of fires for the last few years and certainly decades.\"\nPortland, Oregon\u2019s largest city, drew national attention when federal agents swooped in against the wishes of local leaders to protect federal property that they said was at risk because of the protests, which have occurred every night since May.\u00a0\nSome have included incidents of vandalism and violence, leading businesses near the affected areas to close or board up their windows. But the problems have been mainly confined to small parts of the city, including the area near the federal Hatfield Courthouse.\n\"There\u2019s a lot of damage around the federal courthouse,\" Chatman said. \"But the fact of the matter is this is a very small area of even downtown. We are not under siege.\"\n\"For the average resident of Portland, they probably never lay eyes on some of these fires,\" Chatman added. \"This is a very concentrated area.\"\nThe Portland Police Bureau provided PolitiFact with a map and timeline of the protests from May 29 to Aug. 31. It details where each has taken place, whether a riot was declared, whether arrests were made, and whether the protesters used projectiles, fireworks, vandalism or fires.\u00a0\nBy our count, there were 54 fires set across 95 nights of demonstrations, which have largely taken place at one of 10 discrete locations, according to the map and timeline.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security officer emerges from the Mark O.

Kate Brown, who pointed to a television news station webpage that shows live camera footage of different areas in the state, including parts of Portland.\nTrump has warned that Portland\u2019s protests are an example of the type of unrest that he claims would go unchecked under former Vice President Joe Biden, his challenger in 2020 \u2014 even as the protests continue on his watch. The city, Trump has said, is \"under siege.\"\nBut the president\u2019s description of a city gripped by violence and engulfed in flames has been challenged by journalists working in the area. In July, for example, the editorial board for the Oregonian wrote an opinion piece titled, \"Not under siege, but a city in need.\"\u00a0\n\nTwo people sit in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Ore., on Aug. 27, 2020.

Buzzfeed News and CNN have described the same discrepancy.\u00a0\nRELATED: No, these aren\u2019t photos of Portland, Ore., after the protests\nWe asked journalists from the Oregonian and other local news outlets about Trump\u2019s claim. They described an on-the-ground reality in which most protesters have been peaceful, while a subset of people have clashed with police, graffitied buildings and ignited fires. The fires that have ensued have been quickly extinguished and confined to a few small parts of the city.\n\"Portland is not ablaze, though we do love the Trail Blazers,\" said Anna Griffin, the news director at Oregon Public Broadcasting, in a reference to the city\u2019s NBA team. Street-level activism has been a feature of Portland\u2019s culture for years, Griffin said.\n\"We\u2019re a small city reckoning with centuries of racism \u2014 both within our law enforcement and laws themselves \u2014 and that reckoning isn\u2019t tidy,\" added Alex\u00a0Zielinski, the news editor at the Portland Mercury, an alternative newspaper. \"But no, we\u2019re not on fire.\"\n\u00a0Our ruling\nTrump said of Portland: \"The entire city is ablaze all the time.\"\nWhile months of protests in Portland have seen many fires set to streets, trash cans, and buildings, those incidents have been confined to a few small sections of the city and relatively easy for the city\u2019s fire department to extinguish. Most of the city has been unaffected.\nThe whole city is not in flames. We rate Trump\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18847"}
