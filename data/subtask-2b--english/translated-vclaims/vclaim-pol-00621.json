J.P. Bretzker is preparing a full court press to reform the State's income tax, and critics are also aggressive in trying to stop it. This has led to many questionable allegations from both sides of the positive financial aspect of the Pritzker plan to convert Illinois into a progressive tax from a fixed tax. Britzker recently launched another plane in a speech in front of two major commercial lobbyists opposing his plan. The case he filed for a graduation tax, which the Governor calls a \"fair tax,\" was a case we had never heard of before. \"States with fair taxes create jobs and their economies grow faster,\" said Britzker. It is not our role to study the merits of the debate on flat taxes versus graduation. However, in the past, we have verified the facts that have been confirmed by overwhelming assertions from both sides that have failed to measure at the level of closer inspection. We found that Pritzker's last claim did not stand much better. Forty-one states impose a large-scale income tax, 32 of which are under a phased modified structure. In his speech, Bretzker did not address the details, so we contacted his office for details. Jordan responded by e-mail by comparing the combined annual growth rates of employment and gross domestic product (GDP) in Illinois over a five-year period with the growth rates of five other states: California, New York, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa, all tax revenues at graduation rates. The combined annual growth rates help to measure trends over time. \"Whether I compare Illinois to the economies of the other large state or our neighbours with a fair tax, Illinois has less performance on economic growth and employment,\" Abudaya wrote in e-mail. The data you sent us came from two federal sources: the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labour Statistics. But she's not close to telling the whole story. The gross domestic product (GDP) has grown faster over the past five years in all five states mentioned by Aboday than it was in Illinois, and everyone except Iowa has overcome employment growth as well. But this is just a small sample of countries, and Bretzker has made an overwhelming assertion that cannot be sustained when analysing all 50 states. The Bretzker analysis ignores the fact that all but one of the nine fixed-tax countries in the country also achieved the best growth rate in Illinois for GDP over that five-year period. More than a dozen states with graduated tax systems have experienced anaemia rates than Illinois, and the same pattern applies to employment growth. In fact, more than half of all countries state that tax income - both at constant and graduation rates - showed more pronounced economic growth than Illinois during the period when samples were taken from Bretzker. This refers to the Illinois economy much more than to the advantages of the graduation rate structure than the demand for a large flat tax. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 On January 20, 2012, the experts with whom we spoke agreed that the Pritzker evidence was not convincing. \"You can't just pull out selected countries and say, \"Well, they grew faster, so if we change (modified structures) we grow faster,\" said Kenneth Cress, an expert in public finance at the University of Illinois-Springfield. \"There's not enough there.\" Richard Oxer, an assistant researcher with the Centre for Urban Broken Tax Policy, also said that Bretzker was oversimplifying things. The structure of graduation rates is a tool by which States can increase revenues without increasing the burden on those who earn less, as Uker said. However, there is no guarantee that this will provide a broader economic boost. \"The other side of this is the argument you should get rid of your taxes,\" he added, referring to the growth enjoyed by big states like Texas and Florida, both of which outperform Illinois's performance so far do not impose income tax at all. There is no doubt that none of this gives credibility to critics who raise taxes and predict the adverse consequences for the Illinois economy if interest rate structures also change. We have been informed by the experts we have questioned that existing research does not indicate any significant link, in one way or another, between the type of income tax employed by the State and its general economic performance. \"Even those (studies) that have any effect, they are never significant effects,\" said Therese McGuire, a professor at the Kellogg School of Administration at Northwestern University, which studies regional economic development. \"I don't think we have really strong evidence to go out and say anything strong.\" Our ruling referring to the graduating income tax, Britzker said, \"The states with a fair tax create jobs and grow their economies faster than we do.\" In support of this claim, a spokesman for Bretzker referred to us as five states - two with large populations and three States bordering Illinois - whose income tax is at progressive rates and which, according to federal data, has seen greater economic growth than that of Illinois over the past five years. However, this small sample overlooks what these data sets also show: GDP and employment have risen at rates faster than Illinois in almost every other case of uniform taxation, along with a number of states that do not tax income at all. The experts told us that progressive income tax would probably not solve every economic disease in Illinois, as Britzker suggested, and would not push workers and businesses away from sight as critics expected. We value Bretzker's claim for half the right. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context.
