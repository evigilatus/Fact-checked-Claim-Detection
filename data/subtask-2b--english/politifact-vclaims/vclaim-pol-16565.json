There are numerous examples to choose from, we'll look at two of his more plain-spoken statements here:\n\n\n\"I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country,\" Romney said in a 1994 debate with Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy. \"I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years we should sustain and support it.\"\n\n\nIn a 2002 debate, Romney said there was no difference between his views and that of his Democratic opponent, Shannon P. O'Brien. \"I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose. I will not change any provisions of Massachusetts pro-choice laws,'' he said.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Romney says his views have changed. \"And I get tired of people that are holier than thou because they've been pro-life longer than I have,\" he said at a Republican debate on Aug. 5, 2007.\n\n\n(\n\nPolitifact\n\nlooked at Romney's abortion record previously; check out that story\n\nhere\n\n.)\n\n\nThe sly TV ad from the Log Cabin Republicans merely states, \"A pro-choice record,\" leaving out a verb like \"has\" or \"had.\" The ad could do a better job at pointing out that Romney no longer stands by his pro-choice record, but it doesn't want to. The whole point is to shine a light on where Romney once stood on abortion. His record on abortion is not entirely pro-choice, given his current position opposing abortion rights.
