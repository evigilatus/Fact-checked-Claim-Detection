Here is part of what the President of the National Democratic Commission, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, said in a statement: \"In less than ten days before the early vote in Texas and Wisconsin begins, I am happy with the judicial decisions issued yesterday to repeal the heavy identification laws of these two states.\" Did the Supreme Court order the overthrow of the Wisconsin Act? The leader of the National Democratic Congress was a minority in the use of the term, and we found it in the review of media reports and the reactions of legal and political observers. But the headline of The New York Times in its novel may have had an impact on some -- and in fact, a DNC spokesman pointed out to us in providing support for the claims of Asserman Schultz. \"The laws on voter identity cards in Wisconsin and Texas\" announced the headline of the newspaper on 9 October 2014. The story under this headline, however, used the word \"destroying down\" only when referring to the Texas rule. Here's what he said about Wisconsin: \"The Supreme Court suspended on Thursday evening those in Wisconsin who were responsible for asking voters there to present a photographic identity card before they cast their votes in the next election.\" There is a significant difference between the two states &apos; judgements. In Texas, a federal district court judge - the lowest level in the federal system - found that the State &apos; s identity law was unconstitutional, stating that it deliberately discriminated against black and Spanish voters. The Wisconsin case is much further: Wasserman Schultz's reaction was from the United States Supreme Court. In April 2014, Federal Court Judge Lynn Adelman \"Breaked Down\" the Wisconsin Act, but the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal found that the sound and paved the way for use in the Nov 4, 2014 elections. Several groups then appealed to the United States Supreme Court. In her 9 October application, the Supreme Court did not address the merits of the Constitution of the Wisconsin Act or even decided whether to decide the case at all. Instead, without a comment by the majority in resolution 6.3, it temporarily impeded the implementation of the law, perhaps in response to the plaintiffs &apos; claims that it was too close to the November 2014 elections to be properly implemented. To confirm the limited and temporary nature of the judgement, two judges voted in favour of the Indiana Voter Identity Act in a 2008 ruling - Chief Justice John Roberts and Judge Anthony Kennedy - in the Wisconsin case to prevent the Act at present. Most media, legal observers and participants in the case used terms such as \"closed\" or \"resident\" to describe the influence of the Wisconsin rule. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, the DNA just told us there's a delusional difference between \"destroying down\" and \"closed.\" We heard otherwise. \"It is inaccurate to say that he was \"defeated,\" but understandably,\" given the New York Times address and other media coverage, Daniel B. Tokaji, a professor of law at Ohio State University and an expert in electoral law. In particular, non-lawyers could be forgiven for using the term. \"The Supreme Court did not \"fall down\" the voter identity law,\" the spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of Wisconsin Dana Brock told us. \"The order of the Seventh Circuit of September 12th to suspend the District Court's injunction was revoked.\" She added: \"The order of 12 September of the Seventh Circuit allowed Wisconsin to enforce the voter identity law in November. No action has been taken by the Supreme Court at all with regard to the merits of the Electoral Identity Act.\" Prosecutor Wisconsin (J.B. Van Holen) is exploring ways to restore the law before the November elections. We've asked for a lawyer for one of the groups that's asked to stay in order to overload it. Larry Dobois, Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Wisconsin, said that he would not use \"crash.\" However, he added that there was no technical legal definition of \"criticization,\" so I suppose someone could say that the law was a temporary \"destructor\" or the November election. The National Democratic Council told us that Wasserman Schultz's statement was \"compatible with the news accounts and had one purpose: to clearly inform voters that the action taken by the United States Supreme Court means that the Wisconsin Image Identity Act will not be applicable in this year's elections.\" We took up a fairly similar allegation when it was Jove. Scott Walker said that John Doe's investigation into funding his campaign was \"solved\" after two judges decided it was over. We assessed that claim as false, because it was not final, and we still have more judicial proceedings ahead of us. In fact, the Federal Court of Appeal reversed the lower court &apos; s decision and returned it to the Wisconsin court, where a pre-appeal action for its suspension is pending. Our assessment of Waserman Schultz said that the Supreme Court had repealed Wisconsin's identity election law. The Supreme Court temporarily suspended the entry into force of the Act but took no action on the validity of the Act itself. The fate of the law has not yet been determined. We assess her claim is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07150"}
