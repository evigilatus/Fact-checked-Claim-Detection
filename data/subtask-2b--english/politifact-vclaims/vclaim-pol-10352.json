Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, has made runaway government spending one of his top campaign themes.\n\nMack, who is challenging Democrat U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, recently took aim against President Barack Obama in an op-ed in The Hill.\n\n\"Under President Obama, we\u2019ve had four consecutive years of trillion dollar deficits \u2026 ,\" Mack wrote on Sept. 6, the date that Obama spoke at the Democratic National \u00a0Convention. \"President Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt. His idea of a solution is to raise taxes\u2014even though out-of-control spending that is the key driver of debt\u2014and he ironically calls this a \u2018balanced approach.\u2019\"\n\nWas Mack correct to say that \"Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt?\"\n\nObama\u2019s plan to reduce the deficit\n\nObama released his budget proposal in February 2012, which he said achieved $4 trillion deficit reduction. The plan included discretionary spending caps, reductions in the growth of defense spending and reforms to Medicare, Medicaid, and other health programs over 10 years.\n\nThe Center for Budget and Policy Priorities,a left-leaning think tank, estimated that the president\u2019s combination of spending cuts and tax increases would lower deficits by $3.8 trillion over a decade. That total included the $1 trillion in reductions that the president and Congress agreed to in 2011.\n\nAccording to the center, about 46 percent would come from higher revenues; about 54 percent of the reductions would come through spending cuts.\n\nTo raise revenues, families making over $250,000 a year would pay more, but Obama also has an extensive list of tax breaks he would eliminate. They can be arcane: For example, Obama would repeal last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories.\n\nOn the spending side, the president proposes $580 billion in cuts to a number of programs that range from agricultural subsidies to rental assistance to airport construction.\n\nThe Obama campaign claims that over 10 years, it would trim deficits by $4 trillion. Some have questioned that estimate, though, so we rated their $4-trillion claim Half True. \u00a0We noted that different think tanks and federal agencies have different methods for estimating deficit reduction and that Obama\u2019s plan counts savings that Congress agreed to last year. (Read our previous fact-check for more details on these differing methodologies.)\n\nThe bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has said that Obama\u2019s plan is a good start but too modest in its goals.\n\nObama takes the right approach with \"a gradual and thoughtful deficit reduction plan,\" the committee wrote in recent report. \"However, the proposals in the President\u2019s budget do not go far enough to put the debt on a clear downward path over the next ten years and to control the long-term debt trajectory by reining in the growth of health care and retirement costs.\"\n\nStill, while experts might differ on how much Obama\u2019s plan reduces the deficit, it is a plan. That\u2019s counter to Mack\u2019s assertion that Obama doesn\u2019t have one.\n\n What happens to debt under Obama\u2019s plan\n\nThere\u2019s a critical distinction between the deficit and the debt. The deficit is the difference each year between the money the government takes in (taxes, income and fees) and what it spends (defense, Social Security, Medicare and every other government spending program). The debt is all the money the government has borrowed. In other words, it\u2019s the accumulation of those deficits.\n\nSo while Obama reduces the deficit, because he\u2019s not eliminating it, he\u2019s not really chipping away at the overall debt.\n\nWe contacted several budget experts who work for groups across the political spectrum about Obama\u2019s plans and Mack\u2019s statement that \"President Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt.\"\n\nSome economists told us Obama can make a credible case that he\u2019s reducing debt if he\u2019s reducing its proportion to the size of the overall economy, usually measured as a ratio of debt to the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, which is a measure of the overall economy.\n\nJim Horney of the left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities used the analogy of a family: The key isn\u2019t the amount of money a family owes on their monthly mortgage, but how much that mortgage is as a proportion of a family\u2019s income. That shows whether the family can afford the monthly bill.\n\nOur fiscal challenges are so great that it\u2019s very unlikely we could balance the budget anytime soon, said Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal \u00a0Budget. \u00a0\"The best we can hope for over the next 10 to 20 years is to first stabilize debt as a share of the economy and then put it on a downward path to levels that are safer for the economy,\" he said.\n\nThe bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\u2019s analysis of Obama\u2019s plan states his budget would result in debt levels rising from 73.5 percent of GDP in 2012 up to a peak of 78.6 percent in 2014 and then gradually falling to 75.1 percent by 2022.\n\nBeyond a decade, Obama\u2019s plan would allow debt to rise as a share of the economy as Baby Boomers retire, spiking up expenditures for Social Security and Medicare and due to rising healthcare costs, Peuquet said. And that\u2019s a problem.\n\nJoshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates reducing the debt, said he would prefer a lower debt-to-GDP ratio than Obama\u2019s plan.\n\nHowever, \"it is incorrect to say that the Administration does not have a plan to reduce deficits and stabilize the debt. And stabilizing the debt is an appropriate goal for the nation -- since debt is projected to keep growing more quickly than the economy -- which would be detrimental for economic growth.\"\n\nSome of our experts were more critical of Obama\u2019s plan.\n\nJ.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation said Obama\u2019s plan was not credible. As an example, Obama\u2019s plan claims reductions associated with winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that\u2019s only a savings if we assume the original policy was to continue the wars indefinitely. \u00a0\n\n\"In no year does the government run a surplus, and the deficits are rising steadily toward the end of the 10-year horizon, so it is then axiomatic to say the president lacks a plan to reduce the debt. \u00a0Reducing the debt requires a budget surplus,\" Foster said. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nChris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute, said Obama has \"no plan\" to pay down the debt if we\u2019re referring to total accumulated debt over 10 years. And regarding the deficit, \"the main \u2018plan\u2019 that shrinks the projected deficit over the next decade is that federal revenues are expected to rise as the economy is projected to recover in coming years,\" he said.\n\n\"Both candidates need to do a much better job of providing details of proposed spending reforms and cuts so that America does not go the way of Greece.\"\n\nWe sent an email to Mack\u2019s campaign to ask if he had documentation he wanted us to review and did not get a response.\n\nOur ruling\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Weatherford\n\n\nstated on May 9, 2013 in an op-ed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Katie Sanders \u2022 May 16, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMack said that \"President Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt.\"\n\nObama has presented a plan that reduces the deficit. Analysts have debated whether it goes far enough. But it is a plan.\n\nHowever, while the plan reduces deficits, it doesn\u2019t eliminate them. And that means the sheer amount of the debt continues to grow. Obama\u2019s defenders would say that his plan stabilizes the debt and makes the debt smaller in comparison with the size of the overall economy. But this is not the same thing as reducing the debt itself. \u00a0\n\nSo Mack has a point that Obama\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t reduce the debt in dollars. He\u2019s wrong that Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10352"}
