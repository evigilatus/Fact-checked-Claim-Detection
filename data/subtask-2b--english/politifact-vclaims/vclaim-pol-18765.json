Lucy McBath cherry picks in attack on Karen Handel over CDC funding", "text": "In a new ad, Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath points a finger at her competitor, saying former GOP Rep. Karen Handel\u2019s actions in Congress hindered the nation\u2019s ability to respond to COVID-19.\u00a0\n\"Karen Handel slashed the Centers for Disease Control's ability to fight diseases, cutting millions in research funding,\" the ad\u2019s narrator says over flashing images of a tired medical worker, an empty laboratory and a patient lying in a hospital bed, her eyes closed.\nThe ad ends by stating McBath believes the CDC should be protected, \"not gutted.\"\nBut the attack misses due to cherry-picking: What McBath points to as evidence is Handel\u2019s vote for a massive spending bill to avert a government shutdown, not an up-or-down vote on money for the CDC.\nA competitive rematch\nThis is not the first time McBath and Handel are running for the same seat. Handel served in the House from June 2017 to January 2019, after winning a special election. McBath defeated Handel in Handel\u2019s bid for re-election in November 2018.\nThe McBath-Handel rematch is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. It is rated \"lean Democratic\" by the Cook Political Report, meaning it\u2019s a competitive race but that the Democrat appears to have the advantage.\nIn this campaign, we\u2019ve rated one McBath attack on Handel as Half True; a Handel claim about McBath as False; and an attack by the National Republican Congressional Campaign on McBath as False.\nMcBath\u2019s evidence\nMcBath\u2019s ad cites Handel\u2019s vote in February 2018 for a budget bill, that cleared the House on a 240-186 vote and was signed into law byinto law three days later by President Donald Trump. The measure provided continuing appropriations for numerous federal agencies into March 2018, including the agriculture, commerce, defense, energy, health and human services, interior, justice and transportation departments. The bill was a stopgap measure to avert a government shutdown and keep the government running for six weeks.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill called for a reduction of $1.35 billion over 10 years in the CDC\u2019s Prevention and Public Health Fund which, at the time, accounted for 12% of the CDC\u2019s budget.\u00a0\nAccording to the CDC, the fund must be used \"to provide for expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs to improve health and help restrain the rate of growth in private and public health care costs.\"\nBut a vote for a massive budget bill hundreds of pages long isn\u2019t proof that a representative is voting for, or against, any single provision in the bill. In other words, this was not an up-or-down vote on one portion of the CDC\u2019s budget any more than it was a vote on $14 million in hurricane assistance for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or on $1 million for the office of the inspector in the Economic Development Administration, both of which also were in the bill.\nHandel\u2019s campaign acknowledged that Handel voted for the bill that reduced the Prevention and Public Health Fund, but argued that overall, the CDC\u2019s operating plan for fiscal 2019 showed an increase in funding in most areas.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that federal support to build state and local capacity to manage a new viral crisis fell by 50% after 2003. The decline in federal aid spans three presidencies and many sessions of Congress. President\u00a0Trump sought $100 million in cuts that would have made the situation harder. But Congress ignored the president\u2019s budget plans and largely kept the flow of dollars steady, even increasing them slightly.\nOur ruling\nMcBath claimed in an ad that Handel \"slashed the Centers for Disease Control's ability to fight diseases, cutting millions in research funding.\"\nWhat Handel voted for was a big stopgap funding measure that kept numerous government agencies funded for six weeks and averted a shutdown. It was not an up-or-down vote on CDC funding, though it did include a reduction in one of the CDC\u2019s funds.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18765"}
