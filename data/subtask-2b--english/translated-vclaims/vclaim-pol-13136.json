Paulette attended the debate, and Romney didn't. The former Governor of Minnesota, Bolenti, chose instead to attack President Barack Obama's health care plan, and the new law called \"from the top to the bottom, run by the government, central, limited choice and limited choice system.\" President Obama stood in Iowa in 2008 on the night of the Iowa gatherings and promised the nation that he would reform health care. Paulette said he broke that promise. We have verified a charge that the law is \"government control\" over health care, and we mischaracterized it. (In fact, it was our 2010 lie.) The Health Care Act significantly increases the federal regulation of health insurance, but leaves private insurance and private health-care providers in place. Some said the plan was the same one that Romney supported in Massachusetts in 2002. Federal law is not an accurate version, but it's very similar. In the discussion, the moderator described the Massachusetts plan and then asked Pawlenty, \"A survey just weeks ago showed that 84 per cent of Massachusetts residents were satisfied with the plan. Why isn't that enough for you?\" Paulette didn't answer the question directly instead. She chose to attack Obama's plan. Here, we were interested in verifying Paulinte's statement about what Obama said on the night of the Iowa gatherings, that \"the nation promised that it would reform health care by focusing on cost containment, and opposed individual authorization, and he would do so with the Republicans.\" We wondered whether that was accurate or whether Paulette was putting words in Obama's mouth. We found a copy of Obama &apos; s comments and identified the brief but relevant passage. Here's what Obama said: \"I'm finally going to be president, making health care affordable and available to every American, in the same way that health care in Illinois has expanded, by bringing Democrats and Republicans together to accomplish the task.\" Let's take this piece, piece by piece: Obama, \"He'll do it with the Republicans.\" In fact, Obama said that he would bring the parties together \"to accomplish the task.\" It is also clear that it did not succeed. The final health care law was passed without a single republican vote, and even some Democrats passed to vote against the bill. (A member of the Republican House of Representatives voted for an early version of the bill, but not the final version.) Some Obama supporters argued that he tried to work with the Republicans -- the debate on the bill lasted over a year -- but it didn't work. Whatever the reasons, the bottom line is, yes, Obama said he would recruit Republicans, but no, it didn't. We're assessing this point right. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers stated in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines for security, saying to her, \"We are not working for you.\" You may not remember this, but we certainly remember it: Obama opposed people's demand for health insurance, a point that was the subject of endless debate in the 2008 democratic pre-elections. The Obama Plan did not include a mandate; the plans of candidates Hillary Clinton and John Edwards did. \"I think the problem is not that people try to avoid access to health care. The problem is they can't afford it. This is why my plan emphasizes cost reductions, \"Obama said at the time. The night of Iowa's gatherings, Obama said he wanted to make health \"available\" to all Americans. In view of all the discussions on the mandate, this appears to have been a reference to its opposition to the mandate. However, with the establishment of effective legislation in 2009, Obama changed his view on individual jurisdiction and its acceptance. We evaluated his heart change on our Flip or Meter. Obama said he was willing to accept it as long as it included an exemption from hardship. Individual jurisdiction imposes fines on persons without insurance If people cannot find affordable purchase insurance, measured as a percentage of income, In this case, Obama did not state an individual mandate on the night of the gatherings. But he seemed to hint at her, and it was widely known to be his position. However, later on, the final draft law contains a mandate. We're being evaluated for this point by Pawlanty mostly right. Obama said: \"He will reform health care by focusing on cost containment.\" On the night of Iowa's gatherings, Obama did not say that he would focus on containing costs; he would make health care \"at affordable and affordable prices.\" It's not exactly the same thing. But then we withdrew our old version of Obama &apos; s health care plan, and reminded us of its emphasis on cost containment. Paulenty says that Obama's plan does not focus on cost containment; Obama will no doubt disagree. In our analysis of the health-care plan, we have noted that it contains a variety of measures aimed at containing costs, but there is uncertainty about how these measures will work in the coming years. According to official projections from the Congressional Non-Party Budget Office, people will see different amounts of cost savings, depending on the type of insurance they have. Finally, Massachusetts officials are still working on cost containment. So this point is a little bit weirder, and we're sorting it half the truth. Paulette's claims that Obama broke his promises. It is clear that Obama did not get the votes of Republicans for health care, and he reflected himself against individual delegation. The jury is still abroad to contain the cost. However, we were following Obama's election campaign promise \"to reduce the cost of regular family health insurance premiums by up to $2,500 a year.\" We have fully evaluated this promise, because premiums are not expected to fall in the coming years. There is little uncertainty there, however, as it will be several years before the full implementation of the Health Care Act. In general, we evaluate Pawlenty's statement mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13136"}
