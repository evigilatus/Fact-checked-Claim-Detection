Kamala Harris won a breakout moment in last week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate when she attacked Joe Biden\u2019s record opposing busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s.\u00a0\nBut her critique of the former vice president also placed a spotlight on her claim that she was \"part of the second class to integrate her public schools\" through a busing program in Berkeley.\u00a0\nSome on social media have questioned her claim\u2019s accuracy.\nHarris, 54, repeated her statement twice during her exchange with Biden, right after pointing out that he opposed busing.\u00a0\n\"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\"\n\"I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley, California, public schools almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education.\"\u00a0\nHarris referred to the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.\u00a0\u00a0\nGiven the attention on this topic, we wanted to know whether Harris\u2019 \"second class to integrate\" claim was biographical fact or fiction.\u00a0\nOur research\u00a0\nTo examine Harris\u2019 statement, we spoke with officials from Berkeley Unified School District, a historian who studied the city\u2019s busing integration program, reviewed news articles and Harris\u2019 biography.\nHere\u2019s what we found:\u00a0\nHarris was born in Oakland on Oct. 20, 1964.\nShe grew up in a black middle-class neighborhood in west Berkeley.\nHarris was three years old when Berkeley Unified\u2019s school board voted in January 1968 to desegregate the district\u2019s elementary schools, starting that fall, through a unique two-way busing program.\u00a0\nChildren from the city\u2019s more diverse western neighborhoods were bused to elementary schools in Berkeley\u2019s eastern hills, a more affluent and whiter area. Meanwhile, children from the hills were bused to schools in the more diverse neighborhoods.\nKamala Harris (left) in 1970 with her sister, Maya Harris, and mother, Shyamala Gopalan.

(Courtesy of Kamala Harris)\u00a0\nNatasha Beery, director of community relations at Berkeley Unified School District, told us Harris\u2019 claim was \"absolutely\" accurate. She said Harris attended Thousand Oaks Elementary school, on the city\u2019s northeast side.\n\"She would be part of that second class that integrated our schools through our two-way busing program,\" Beery added. \"It began in 1968. And she joined a group that had started kindergarten the following year in 1969 and so her description is correct.\"\u00a0\nA spokesman for the senator\u2019s campaign told us Harris joined the second class to integrate in first grade in 1970. She had attended a private school for kindergarten the year before. Altogether, that\u2019s about 16 years after the Brown v. Board decision, which loosely fits with Harris\u2019 statement of \"almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the debate, Berkeley Unified published a statement on its website explaining the history of its\u00a0integration program and Harris\u2019 experience.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2018The two girls took the bus up the hill\u2019\nCarole Porter, a former neighbor and elementary school classmate of Harris, corroborated the senator\u2019s statement in a recent New York Times article.\u00a0\n\"The two girls took the bus up the hill from the middle-class Berkeley flats where they lived to Thousand Oaks, a school in the white, more affluent Berkeley hills,\" the article said. \"Ms. Porter recalled that the ride took about 40 minutes.

Harris's Twitter page)\nQuestions about Harris\u2019 claim surfaced, in part, after Gateway Pundit published a misleading article. The conservative website alleged the senator fabricated her story, citing Berkeley High School yearbook photos that show diverse classes before Harris was born.\u00a0\nBut school district officials, and a city historian, say that allegation ignores a key fact: \"Berkeley has only one high school, so it was always integrated or at least desegregated,\" said Charles Wollenberg, author of \"Berkeley: A City in History.\"\u00a0\nIntegration at the city\u2019s junior high schools started in 1964, Wollenberg said. It took place without busing, \"as \u2018Busing\u2019 was still an unwelcome word in Berkeley,\" at the time, according to a report the school district published last year marking the 50th anniversary of the busing system.\u00a0\n\"The bottom line,\" Wollenberg added, \"is that she was telling a simplified but basically accurate version of the truth.\"\nWe asked for Harris\u2019 position on using busing to integrate schools today. Her spokesman said: \"Senator Harris supports federal measures to increase school diversity, including resources for busing,\" such as the\u00a0Strength in Diversity Act proposed by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-CT, and Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-OH.\u00a0\nIt would authorize $120 million in grants for \"voluntary community-driven strategies to increase diversity in schools,\" including expanding busing.\u00a0\nOur rating\nSen. Kamala Harris claimed she was \"part of the second class to integrate her public schools\" and was bused to school in Berkeley, Calif.\u00a0\nWe found Harris was bused to school, and joined the second class of a pioneering elementary school integration program in Berkeley. She was a first grader when she joined in 1970.\nHer statement could have used the clarification that the city\u2019s junior high schools had already integrated several years earlier in 1964, though not through a busing program.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also noteworthy that Berkeley\u2019s high school was integrated years before Harris started school, but, again, not because of busing. Instead, the high school was racially diverse because it was the only comprehensive public high school in the city, drawing students from all backgrounds.\u00a0\nEven with these clarifications, Harris\u2019 statement is generally correct, given the context of her exchange with Biden on busing. It was supported by her school district, a city historian and recent news articles.\nWe rate her claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2019-07-03 01:03:29 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  Says \"I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley, California, public schools.\"     Kamala Harris U.S. Senator     Thursday, June 27, 2019 2019-06-27    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00466"}
