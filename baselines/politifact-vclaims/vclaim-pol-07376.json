Even worse to the Fox News gang is how much President Barack Obama\u2019s administration is leaning on Sharpton as \"a de facto contact and conduit\" on race issues, according to a Politico Magazine profile.\nAppearing on The O\u2019Reilly Factor on the same night as Brown\u2019s funeral, Kelly criticized Sharpton for getting ahead of the facts in his fiery speeches to emotional crowds. It was the same segment in which she and O\u2019Reilly debated the concept of \"white privilege,\" with Kelly presenting several economic, social and educational statistics to show how blacks are disadvantaged in this country.\n\"What they don't need in this case, or in any case, is people like Al Sharpton going in there and declaring as a matter of fact that the, that Michael Brown didn't use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer,\" Kelly said.\nO\u2019Reilly said, \"Absolutely, that just alienates everybody.\"\n\"If you have somebody come in and prejudge -- someone you trust and rely upon -- come and tell you the facts are one way, you believe him,\" Kelly said of Sharpton. \"That's why he is abusing his power.\"\nWe wanted to know if Sharpton flat-out said Brown \"didn\u2019t use any deadly force\" before he was killed.\nWhat happened\nThe official story of what happened before Brown was shot at least six times is not entirely known -- a factor driving the unrest against law enforcement. A grand jury is weighing evidence in the case and will decide whether to indict Wilson, and the St. Louis County Police Department and FBI are investigating the shooting.\nCNN and Vox have compiled guides to varying accounts from witnesses and law enforcement about what happened. Before noon, there was an alleged strong-arm robbery involving Brown and friend Dorian Johnson at a convenience store. Shortly after, Wilson stopped the men for walking in the middle of a street, without knowing they were suspects in the robbery, Ferguson\u2019s police chief has said.\nSome witnesses and Brown\u2019s advocates say Brown had been shot and was turning around to face Wilson with his hands raised when Wilson fired at him again, hitting his head. Wilson told police that Brown assaulted him, pushed him inside of his patrol car, and tried to grab his handgun, and the town\u2019s police chief said Wilson sought medical care for his swollen face after the altercation.\nWe won\u2019t go into more detail in this fact-check about the various accounts, but we thought it was important to highlight how the narratives conflict.\nWe may never know what really happened, said\u00a0David Klinger, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of Missouri-St Louis.\u00a0\n\"For anybody who hasn\u2019t seen the investigative case file to say that he categorically is confident that it was not possible that Mr. Brown posed a threat to Officer Wilson\u2019s life, he is simply wrong,\" Klinger said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Sharpton said\nAbout a week before Brown\u2019s funeral, Sharpton addressed Ferguson residents at a unity rally. Sharpton says he was invited to town by Brown\u2019s grandfather.\nSharpton decried the release of security footage from the convenience store as a post-mortem smear of Brown\u2019s character that did nothing to illuminate what happened before he died.\n\"But the issue is not whether he shoplifted. The issue is not what he did before,\" Sharpton said Aug. 17. \"The issue is how a young man with no deadly threat, no life-extenuating circumstances, was shot multiple times. That\u2019s the issue, and that\u2019s the issue America has got to deal with.\"\nKelly highlighted this part of his speech in her Aug. 19 edition of The Kelly File and alluded to it on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show Aug. 25.\nSharpton\u2019s defense: I\u2019m not \u2018Walter Cronkite\u2019\nSharpton defended himself in an interview with PunditFact. He does not deny that he said essentially what Kelly described.\nBut he said his audience knows his point of view and that he was giving his opinion that Brown posed \"no deadly threat\" because he was unarmed. No one disputes that Brown did not have a gun.\n\"People don\u2019t think that I\u2019m Walter Cronkite reporting the news,\" he said. \"That\u2019s my opinion, just like they\u2019re giving their opinion on white privilege.\"\nHe shifted his rhetoric a bit when asked about Kelly\u2019s specific qualm, saying he believes there is no \"apparent\" evidence that Brown posed a deadly threat.\nSharpton also said, if anything, O\u2019Reilly and other Fox News hosts are just as guilty of expressing their viewpoints.\n\"If (O\u2019Reilly) can write books and all of them over there can write books on their opinions, how can you tell me don\u2019t go to a rally on my opinion?\" Sharpton said. \"We\u2019re all advocates. I use my feet to advocate, they use the pen to advocate.\"\nKelly could not be reached through a Fox spokeswoman or Twitter.\nOur ruling\nIn criticizing Sharpton, Kelly said, Sharpton went to Ferguson, Mo., and is \"declaring as a matter of fact that ... Michael Brown didn't use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer.\"\nThat\u2019s not exactly what Sharpton said, but it\u2019s pretty close. The only possible caveat is Sharpton says he was speaking as a matter of opinion based on what he had so far, more than a matter of fact. That\u2019s in the eye of the beholder.\nKelly\u2019s statement is accurate. We rate it True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07376"}
