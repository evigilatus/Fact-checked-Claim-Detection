Yes and no", "text": "A pair of high court rulings set the stage for Wisconsin\u2019s April 7, 2020 pandemic election.\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down an order from Gov. Tony Evers that would have moved the election back to June, which kept in-person voting in place.\nAnd the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that all absentee ballots had to be postmarked by Election Day, reversing a federal judge\u2019s order, forcing thousands who requested but didn\u2019t receive an absentee ballot to vote in person if they wanted their vote to count.\nA viral image on Facebook claims the latter ruling had some irony to it.\n\"Conservative Supreme Court Justices vote remotely to deny Wisconsin voters their right to vote remotely,\" the April 7, 2020, post says, accompanied by pictures of the five men comprising the conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

It has postponed all oral arguments for March and April.\nIt\u2019s been a while since that happened, the court said.\n\"The Court\u2019s postponement of argument sessions in light of public health concerns is not unprecedented,\" a March 16, 2020, release said. \"The Court postponed scheduled arguments for October 1918 in response to the Spanish flu epidemic. The Court also shortened its argument calendars in August 1793 and August 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"right\" to vote remotely\nThe second part of this claim isn\u2019t so simple, asserting there is a right to vote remotely that was stripped away.\nWe\u2019ll start by backing up a step.\nThe issue before the U.S. Supreme Court was whether to allow ballots postmarked after Election Day to be counted as long as they arrived by April 13.\nA prior federal court ruling had extended the deadline by which clerks had to receive absentee ballots from April 7 \u2014 Election Day \u2014 to April 13. Republicans argued those ballots still had to be postmarked by Election Day in order to count, while Democrats argued anything that arrived by April 13 should be allowed \u2014 effectively extending the election by six days.\nBy a 5-4 vote, with all conservative justices in favor, the Supreme Court ruled ballots had to be postmarked by Election Day.\n\"Extending the date by which ballots may be cast by voters \u2014 not just received by the municipal clerks but cast by voters \u2014 for an additional six days after the scheduled election day fundamentally alters the nature of the election,\" the majority opinion says.\nSo did that amount to denying voters their rights to vote remotely?\nThe longstanding remote voting availability in Wisconsin has been that voters are permitted to submit absentee ballots up to Election Day. That was not changed. The high court simply denied a request to extend beyond Election Day the period in which votes could be turned in.\nThe nuance here is that thousands of Wisconsinites never received the absentee ballots they requested \u2014 in some cases well before the election. So those voters were denied the ability to vote remotely, but that was due to systematic errors in ballot distribution, not directly via Supreme Court action.\nLiberals argued accommodations should have been made for those people who did not receive ballots they requested in the required timeframe (up to the Friday before the election).\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says conservative Supreme Court justices voted remotely \"to deny Wisconsin voters their right to vote remotely.\"\nThe court vote involved did take place remotely.\nBut the latter half of this claim overreaches. The traditional \"right\" to vote remotely involves submitting an absentee ballot by Election Day. That right was not taken away. The high court simply did not extend that right to days past the election as Democrats requested.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16903"}
