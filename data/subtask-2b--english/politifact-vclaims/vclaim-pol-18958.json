One of them revived an attack shared on social media earlier in the summer.\nBiden referenced Trump\u2019s walk from the White House to the historic St. John\u2019s Church on Lafayette Square. It came on June 1, when downtown Washington, D.C., was full of protesters following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police days earlier.\u00a0\nCritics mostly blasted Trump for using tear gas to clear nonviolent protesters just before his walk to the church for a photo-op. But some on social media took aim at how Trump held the Bible.\nFor instance, novelist Stephen King tweeted, \"Dear fundamentalist Christian Trump supporters: If Obama had held the Bible backwards and upside down, you would immediately have called him the Antichrist.\" The tweet attracted more than 164,000 likes.\nDear fundamentalist Christian Trump supporters: If Obama had held the Bible backwards and upside down, you would immediately have called him the Antichrist.\u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 2, 2020 \n\u00a0\nAt the CNN town hall, Biden said that forces physically moved people out of Trump\u2019s way \"so he can walk across to a Protestant church and hold a Bible upside down.\"\nBiden has made the claim about the upside-down Bible before, even though fact-checkers had debunked it. The claim has also appeared in various news accounts about the church photo-op and social media posts.\nTrump himself has previously denied that he held the Bible upside down.\u00a0\nA @FoxNews commentator just ripped me with lies, with nobody defending. They talked about the \u201cfriendly\u201d protesters (they set the Church on fire the day before. They were anything but friendly), and how I stood and held the Bible upside down - it wasn\u2019t upside down. @edhenry\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2020 \n\u00a0\nWhat does the evidence show?\nWe scrutinized a series of images from the Associated Press as well as raw video from NBC News, and the truth is clear: Trump held the Bible right-side up.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bible he held up had no writing on the front cover, so to viewers who couldn\u2019t see the spine, it may have looked like he was holding it upside down and backwards. But here are several AP images that clearly show the spine right-side up.\n\n\n\n\nIn the following images, perhaps the most iconic ones taken of the event, it is a little harder to read the spine, but the free end of the ribbon bookmark clearly dangles below the Bible, which is how it was when the Bible was oriented correctly in the other images.\n\n\nWe also reviewed the video of the event and confirmed that Trump consistently held the Bible right-side up. In fact, at several points he appears to look down on it to make sure that he\u2019s holding it correctly.\nThe Biden campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nOur ruling\nBiden said that after Trump walked across Lafayette Square to a church, he held a Bible upside down.\nThis false claim spread on social media earlier this summer, without evidence, and made it into several news reports and opinion pieces.\u00a0 But fact-checkers debunked it as early as June, and a review of still images and video from that day show clearly that it is inaccurate. Trump held the Bible right-side up throughout the event.\u00a0\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire!\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18958"}
