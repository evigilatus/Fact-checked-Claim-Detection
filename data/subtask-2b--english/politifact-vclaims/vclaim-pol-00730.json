At some places on this earth, women\u2019s rights are limited to getting a spoonful of water before stoning.

It is completely unrelated to Iran, Islam or stoning.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA reverse-image search of the photograph reveals it started to appear in the meme in 2018. The search also shows that \u00a0it was not captured in Iran but in Cali, Colombia, in July 2003.\nThe photo is part of a series taken by various news agencies, like Reuters, and depicts Maria Gabriela Ruiz, a 66-year-old Colombian woman who was one of three people protesting the Colombian government\u2019s failure to relocate 150 displaced people to a safer sector of the city of Cali, according to one caption. Ruiz and others protested by voluntarily burying themselves up to their necks in July 2003, as was documented by photographs of the protests, which are available on Getty Images and Adobe\u2019s stock images.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Iran hasn\u2019t been criticized for its forms of punishment, which still include stoning as a legal method.\nThe photograph is real but has nothing to do with Islam, Sharia law or stoning, as social media\u2019s false caption suggests.
