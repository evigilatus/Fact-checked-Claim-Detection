Kaptur voted yes; Kucinich voted no.\n\nThe 19 projects are all directed spending, or earmarks, for Ohio. We confirmed them on the LegiStorm database using information from the group Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\nThey were sponsored by Kaptur alone or with other members of the Ohio delegation, including Republicans and Democrats. Kucinich co-sponsored one of the appropriations, $2 million for research on renewable hydrocarbon fuels for military applications, at the Edison Materials Technology Center in Toledo.\n\nThe earmarks totaled more than $59 million in our count.\n\n\"We used a conservative estimate,\" Kaptur spokesman Steve Fought said.\n\nIn response, Kucinich campaign spokesman Andy Juniewicz noted something else about the military spending act.\n\n\"The principal provisions of that bill included $127.3 billion in additional defense spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\nThough the measure also included \"a host of other, non-defense-related expenditures,\" he said, Kucinich voted against it as a long-time opponent of the wars.\n\n\"He has urged for years that those wars be ended and the troops brought home, and that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent there be re-directed to support crucial domestic needs, including re-building the nation's infrastructure, improving education, and meeting the health care needs of the uninsured and under-insured,\" Juniewicz said. \"For Kaptur to misrepresent his anti-war vote as a vote against new manufacturing jobs in Northern Ohio is, plainly and deliberately, dishonest.\"\n\nKaptur's campaign called it \"a matter of how you characterize the votes.\"\n\n\"Those projects were in that bill, and Kucinich voted against them, including one of the projects he had sponsored,\" Fought said. \"He wants to characterize it as an anti-war vote and not an anti-jobs vote.\n\n\"In Congress you don't get to cherry pick on legislation. He wants to have it both ways. It's a matter of whether you take responsibility for your final vote or not.\"\n\nWe think characterization is an issue on both sides.\n\nKaptur\u2019s statement is partially accurate. Kucinich did vote against the legislation containing the earmarks. But there are important details missing from the claim.\n\nWhile the measures sponsored by Kaptur were, in fact, appropriations for work to be done on projects in Ohio, her campaign omits important information by characterizing earmarks in the defense budget simply as money \"for new manufacturing jobs.\"\n\nAlso, legislators frequently face the dilemma of having to vote against programs they would normally support because they are so opposed to other provisions in the same piece of legislation.\n\nKaptur and Kucinich are longtime colleagues in the House. As such, Kaptur certainly is well aware of Kucinich\u2019s steadfast opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His vote in this case is consistent with that position.\n\nCharacterizing his vote as opposition to spending on programs that could create jobs is simply misleading.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Kaptur\u2019s claim rates Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11557"}
