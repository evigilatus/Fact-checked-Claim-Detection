In a problematic way, Cruz said that President Barack Obama's administration does not recognize the religious intolerance of Iran's leaders. Cruise, speaking to Governor Hugh Hewitt's commentator, said that enthusiasm had been incorporated into the country's calendar. In fact, Cruz said, \"Every day, or every year, instead, Iran celebrates as a holiday what they call death until American Day. This is a real holiday in Iran. Here, we have Thanksgiving, we have Christmas, we have Fourth of July. Every year in Iran, they celebrate death until American Day, the anniversary of Iran in the 1970s of which Americans were taken hostage. We were wondering if there was such a holiday. In support of Cruz's interrogation, Cruz Phil Novak's spokesman e-mailed that Iranians were celebrating every November the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in 1979. He referred to an Associated Press news story in November 1987, according to which Iran's leaders had just announced a national holiday on the occasion of the seizure of the United States Embassy in Tehran in 1979 \"and asked their people to go to the streets to make \"America trembling.\" Tehran's radio had called private history, Nov 4, 1987, \"Death to American Day,\" as the story had mentioned. That date was eight years ago today, when students seized the Embassy and detained 52 hostages who remained captive until the end of Jimmy Carter &apos; s presidency in early 1981. As AP's story said, history marks the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad, founder of Islam, and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the expulsion of Ayatollah Rouhullah Khomeini from Iran to Turkey by Shah Iran, who fled in January 1979; weeks later, Khomeini returned with victory. More recently, according to the New York Times story of October 2013, to which Novak also referred, Iran's \"hardcore navies\" planned to commemorate Nov 4, 2013, as \"a great day of death in America.\" Yet, the same story said that the cheers \"death in America\" were falling from routine use; Hassan Rouhani, Iran's newly elected president, was saying that the country no longer needed slogans. Further news stories have been found in the Nexus database, which resulted in November 2014, a British Broadcasting Corporation news report quoting the site of Iran's conservative and privately owned news agency Farris, which says: \"Since the 1979 takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran, Iranians have celebrated this event every year to hold an anniversary event and celebrate it as a national day against \"World Scout.\" On 5 November 2014, the Herald printed a photo of this description: \"The thousands of Iranians attended a major anti-United States gathering on the anniversary of the seizure of the United States Embassy in Tehran in 1979. The gathering came outside the former Embassy compound a few days before a major meeting was held between senior diplomats in the two countries on the Iranian nuclear programme. The newspaper said that crowds cheer \"down with America \" and \"death to Britain. \" So it seems that at least in Tehran, it's called Nov 4 every year. After that, our search for confirmation of the history of the anniversary is a national holiday near Christmas or the 4th of July called, as the Senator said, the Day of Death of America. The list of Iranian holidays published by the Iranian office in Washington, D.C., on the Internet does not show a special name for 4 November. However, this list may only cover the days when Iran &apos; s United States office is closed. Separately, we have monitored a list of official holidays in Iran published by Columbus Travel Media, a company that describes itself as \"dedicating itself to providing objective, accurate, informative and reliable travel content.\" His list shows no November holiday in Iran. Joe Biden says: \"More than anyone in such a short period of time, Obama, more than Trump, has issued more than anyone.\" Gary Seck, a scientist at the Middle East Institute of Columbia University, says by e-mail, \"Death to America\" is an Iranian revolutionary slogan that screamed or chanted \"in most of the revolution-related events. I am sure he will hear in the November demonstrations, but I am not aware that it is the official name of the day or event. This slogan screams every Friday at weekly prayers throughout Iran.\" Similarly, Alex Fatanka, Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C., said that the annual events in Nov 4 were \"an anti-American organized show,\" not a national holiday. \"What he said, the history of the system of throwing off rich anti-Americanism,\" Fattanca e-mailed. Mirzad Progerdi, a politician at Syracuse University, described the claim as incorrect, and said by e-mail: \"There are celebrations in Nov 4, which is the anniversary of the seizure of the American Embassy,\" but \"nothing like death for America's national holiday.\" John Lembert, Professor in the United States. The former Iranian Navy Academy and hostage, by e-mail, said that Nov 4 \"is distinguished by demonstrations and speeches, although former President Mohamed \"Khatami\" (1997-2005) limited those events while in office. I've never heard it refer to the Day of Death for America. I also know that he does not have the status of \"national holiday\" during which offices and schools are supposed to be closed.\" Shahin Gerami, a specialist in Persian studies at the San Jos\u00e9 State University, telephoned us, and the annual demonstrations were \"highly coordinated\" by the Iranian Government, as suggested by some celebrations in Russia. She said that shops, offices and banks did not close because they were not vacations. She had never heard anyone refer to November 4 as dying for American Day. The Cruz office has alerted us to much of what we have heard. The spokesperson for Cruz (Amanda Carpenter) responded by e-mail that the annual mark of Nov4 \"is consistent with the working definition of the holiday. St. Patrick's Day is an upcoming event that most Americans recognize as a holiday, although it is not considered a federal holiday. Just because Iran didn't call Death Day for America as an official holiday doesn't mean that Sun's description was wrong or that these routine celebrations were less disturbing. Our judgment, Cruz, said that every year, Iran has a holiday like Thanksgiving, Christmas and the 4th of July called Death Day for America. Each year, demonstrations in Tehran commemorate the fourth anniversary of the seizure of the American Embassy by students in 1979 and the taking of hostages. However, this date does not seem to resemble the special American days that Cruz has cut short. In fact, it's not a calendar holiday at all, nor is it officially designated as the Day of Death for America.
