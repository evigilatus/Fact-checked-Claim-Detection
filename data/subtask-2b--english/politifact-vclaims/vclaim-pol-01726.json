(It\u2019s at about 2:58 in this video.)\nIs that correct? We found that this is more of a fuzzy issue than a precise one, but the evidence suggests that it was not unreasonable for O\u2019Rourke to make this declaration.\n\"By most objective statistical or mathematical measures, Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the U.S.,\" said Daniel McGlone, a senior analyst with Azavea, a Philadelphia-based firm that has studied congressional district line-drawing.\nMichael Li, senior counsel with the Democracy Program at New York University Law School\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, agreed.\n\"At the congressional level, it\u2019s fair to say Texas is one of the most skewed\" based on partisan bias, Li said.\nThe hardest part of analyzing O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement is sorting through countless measurements that can be used, experts said.\n\"Does he mean gerrymandered by party? By race? Does he mean that the districts don't conform to traditional geographic criteria? You have to define what is meant by \u2018gerrymandered\u2019 before you can rank every state on a single scale,\" said Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. (O\u2019Rourke\u2019s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\nInto the void have rushed \"legal experts, mathematicians, data scientists and other experts suggesting various metrics or combinations of metrics to score and judge whether a district or plan is gerrymandered,\" McGlone said.\nA 2017 analysis by Azavea used a method called the \"efficiency gap,\" a statistic developed by McGhee and Nicholas Stephanopoulos of the University of Chicago Law School in 2014. It measures how many votes a party \"wastes\" in a small number of districts. If the district lines had been drawn more efficiently -- essentially, more equitably -- these \"wasted\" votes could have been used to make other districts more competitive.\nUsing this method, Azavea ranked Texas as the fifth-most gerrymandered state, behind North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York.\nAnother 2017 analysis, by the liberal Brennan Center, found that the three states with the strongest partisan bias in their district lines were Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, followed by a second tier that included Florida, Ohio, Virginia -- and Texas, placing O\u2019Rourke\u2019s state in the top seven in this analysis.\nA third analysis, from December 2015, was undertaken by Christopher Ingraham, a data specialist previously with the Brookings Institution and the Pew Research Center and now with the Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog section. Ingraham\u2019s calculation placed Texas seventh, behind California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, North Carolina and Virginia. (All three of these studies looked at Pennsylvania's district lines before they were overturned and redrawn in 2018)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRanking\n\n\nAzavea\n\n\nBrennan Center\n\n\nIngraham\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nOhio\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\nNew York\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida *\n\n\nNew York\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nOhio *\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\n\n21-state tie\n\n\nTexas *\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\n\n--\n\n\nVirginia *\n\n\nTexas\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\n\n--\n\n\nNot specified\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\n\n--\n\n\n--\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\n\n--\n\n\n--\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n* Study did not distinguish ranking spots among these states\nSo in these studies, Texas consistently places somewhere between the fifth and seventh most gerrymandered states.\nEach of these three analyses were derived from both geographical and political factors, taking into account both linear geometry and voting patterns. That makes these studies the most useful ones for analyzing O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment, since he used the term \"gerrymandering,\" placing the remark in a political context.\nA few other studies have taken a more limited look, focusing only on how complicated the district lines are, typically using the yardstick of \"compactness.\" A perfect square or circle is compact; an octopus-shaped district is the opposite. A more complicated district border may be a sign that the line-drawers in the state legislature drew the map with partisan factors in mind.\nIn compactness-only analysis, the congressional lines in Texas also rank as pretty non-compact, but not as high on the list of states as in the studies that take into account partisan voting history as well.\nOne Azavea study used four different mathematical methods to calculate a district\u2019s compactness. Texas ranked between 11th and 15th least compact in these four measurements.\nAnd Brian Kurilla, a North Carolina-based cognitive psychologist who writes the Geek Psychologist blog, found that Texas ranked 12th lowest in compactness.\nThese studies are less helpful in analyzing O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remark, since there may -- or may not -- be a connection between byzantine district borders and partisan biases. \"There are many reasons why a district might be non-compact, only one of which is partisan intent,\" said William T. Adler, a computational research specialist at the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. Others could be patterns of population settlement or natural geographical features, for instance.\nA third way to look at the question involves racial disparities enforced through congressional line-drawing. This is a harder-to-quantify factor, but Texas has been enmeshed in race-based redistricting lawsuits for years, suggesting that it would rank high if this metric were used instead.\n\"Texas is a persistent offender\" on race-based redistricting, said Sam Wang, a neuroscience professor who heads the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. \"Texas'\u00a0redistricting shenanigans are never-ending.\"\nOur ruling\nO\u2019Rourke said, \"Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the union.\"\nThere are many ways to analyze this question, and depending on the method, the rankings vary a bit. But studies that look at the intersection of geographical compactness and partisan voting history consistently place Texas between fifth and seventh on the list of most gerrymandered states in the nation. Since O\u2019Rourke called Texas \"one of the most\" gerrymandered states, such studies support his point.\nWe rate his statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-16 19:21:01 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the union.\"    Beto O'Rourke U.S. Senate candidate, D-Texas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFn04RRqazc   remarks on HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" Friday, March 16, 2018 2018-03-16    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01726"}
