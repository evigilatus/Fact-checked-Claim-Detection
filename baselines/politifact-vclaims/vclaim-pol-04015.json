The time frame he\u2019s using is indistinct, but \"a single year\" probably relates to the annual change in GDP.\nLooking at the economic statistics under those guidelines, Trump would be correct.\u00a0But the comparison he's making about Obama provides a narrow view of the economy.\n\"I suppose he\u2019s using year-over-year data, with which the claim is true but misleading,\" Princeton economist Alan Blinder told PolitiFact Florida. Blinder and another Princeton economics professor, David Watson, examined GDP growth during presidential administrations in a July 2014 study.\nThere are any number of historical vagaries that color what affects GDP during any administration, Obama included. Obama has overseen the country climbing out of a historical recession that left the housing market depressed, wages low, and businesses wary of investing. He\u2019s also had a Congress that has largely pushed an austerity agenda against his wishes. And global crises like instability in the Middle East and slowed growth in China and Europe have lowered demand for U.S. products and pushed the dollar higher.\n\"The fact that the economy has steadily improved is actually fairly remarkable, considering what else has been happening,\" said Christian Weller, a University of Massachusetts Boston public policy professor and a fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.\nAnnual figures on GDP growth goes back to 1929, and often is used to back up the same talking point on conservative media outlets that Obama has not had a full calendar year of aggregate GDP growth of at least 3 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows Herbert Hoover, who was inaugurated in March 1929 and left office in March 1933, was the last president to have this distinction. Hoover presided over an economy mired in the Great Depression that shrank during his term.\nEvery president since then has seen at least one calendar year with annual GDP growth of at least 3 percent or higher. The best average growth in a single calendar year under Obama is 2.6 percent in 2015, and never 3 percent or more. No president has experienced that since Hoover.\nBut experts said Trump\u2019s use of \"modern history\" is vague, and using the annual change in GDP is perhaps not the best measure. The best data goes back to 1947, when the federal government started tracking GDP by quarter.\nThat would give a more nuanced picture of the data \u2014 the economy in the first quarter of a presidency is often attributed to the preceding administration, for example. It also would coincide with the historical boom in the nation\u2019s economy after World War II.\nGoing by quarters, growth within a year was higher than 3 percent during two periods during Obama\u2019s presidency, Blinder said. Between the third quarters of 2009 and 2010, GDP growth was 3.4 percent. From the first quarters of 2014 and of 2015, it was 3.3 percent.\nOverall growth rates for several administrations have exceeded 3 percent, but Weller\u00a0said context is important.\nWithout complete data for 2016, the average growth rate during Obama\u2019s two terms was 2 percent, Weller said. That was on par with George H.W. Bush\u2019s term and faster than George W. Bush\u2019s average.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth.\"\nAlthough Trump\u2019s light on specifics, that\u2019s accurate if he is looking solely at year-over-year figures for GDP growth going back to the Hoover administration. Experts told us that presenting the stats the way Trump did doesn't tell the whole story. And if we examine the data annually by quarters, Obama has presided over periods of growth topping 3 percent.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c46d6ec9-ea86-45ce-8245-091394df52e0", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04015"}
