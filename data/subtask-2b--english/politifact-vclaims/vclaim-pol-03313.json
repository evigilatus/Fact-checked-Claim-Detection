Some of the other containers, the post claimed, carried other contraband, like illegal fruit and several kinds of drugs.\nThe article was flagged by Facebook users, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to cut down on fake posts being shared in news feeds. It has appeared on other sites, as well.\nThe Clinton Foundation was recently the subject of fake news posts that falsely said Chelsea Clinton had been charged with fraud for essentially stealing from the nonprofit, which was shut down.\nThis particular fake story, like so many others, originated at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we\u2019ve previously checked. This story originally appeared on May 11.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site\u2019s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately worked to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don\u2019t rely on facts.\nThe articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.\nOne way to tell if the story is made up, beyond its absurdity, is a link allegedly to a CNN story that is actually to a Forrest Gump meme that reads, \"Are you stupid or something?\"\nJust to be sure, we contacted the Clinton Foundation, which said no, they didn\u2019t own or operate any cargo ships.\nThe picture included with the original fake story is a crude Photoshopped image that really is a press photo of the Port of Baltimore. But the port also picked up on this fake story the same day it appeared, tweeting out:\nA story was published on websites mentioning the Port of Baltimore & a cargo ship raid. It is false. None of the events it cites took place.\u2014 Port of Baltimore (@portofbalt) May 11, 2017\n\nWe checked the cargo manifest on this fake news and found the claim didn\u2019t hold water.\nWe rate it\u00a0Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-05-12 21:33:31 UTC   Politifact    6 1 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Clinton Foundation cargo ship raided at Port of Baltimore\" caught smuggling 460 undocumented immigrants.
