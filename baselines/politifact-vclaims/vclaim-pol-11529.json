He took a swing at the media. He tackled the economy, which some see as the president\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel in this year\u2019s election.\n\nGingrich said the media won\u2019t report news that dents Obama\u2019s reputation. He gave the nation\u2019s improving unemployment rate as an example. \u00a0\n\n\"That\u2019s why on Friday when the unemployment numbers came out you didn\u2019t get anybody in the news media pointing out that the biggest contribution to the unemployment number was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce,\" Gingrich said.\n\nWe at PolitiFact Georgia felt obliged to address the media\u2019s alleged lack of due diligence by deploying our Truth-O-Meter.\n\nWe contacted the Gingrich campaign, but it did not respond. We took a closer look at the data ourselves.\n\nLately, it\u2019s popular among Republicans to question whether the economy is truly recovering. We often hear claims that the improving unemployment rate doesn\u2019t tell the whole story or somehow underplays the nation\u2019s economic troubles.\n\nWe turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government\u2019s official keeper of employment data. The numbers it issued Feb. 3, the day Gingrich mentioned on the Boortz show, said that the unemployment rate dropped to 8.3 percent in January.\n\nWe talked to four labor economists about this data. They agreed that Gingrich is using it wrong.\n\nIn fact, those who performed a close analysis of the numbers agreed the data suggest the opposite.\n\nThe BLS surveys a sample of the U.S. population to determine which respondents are working; which ones are not but are looking for a job; and which ones don\u2019t have a job, are able to work, but are not looking for work.\n\nIt calculates the unemployment rate by taking the number of people who are unemployed but are looking for work and dividing it by the sum of two categories -- those who are employed, plus those who are not but looking for work.\n\nThis means the unemployment rate does not account for an important category of people -- those who don\u2019t have a job and are able to work, but who are not actively searching for employment. This \"not in the labor force\" category may include people who stopped looking for work because they\u2019re going to school, taking care of children, have retired, gave up looking or any number of other reasons.\n\nThis also means that two factors could push the unemployment rate lower: More people could be getting jobs, or more could have dropped out of the labor force.\n\nWe looked at the BLS data for those \"not in the labor force\" and found that between December and January, their ranks appeared to swell by some 1.2 million.\n\nThis seems to support Gingrich\u2019s statement, but labor economists say otherwise.\n\nThis is why: The BLS bases its unemployment rate on a survey that samples only a portion of the U.S. population. Sometimes, this can cause problems. For instance, the sample might be made up of only 40 percent of women, when they actually make up half the population. Or the sample may contain too great a proportion of Montanans and not enough Floridians. \u00a0\n\nBLS economists address this problem by running this data through a series of \"weights.\" These are mathematical equations that smooth out quirks in the sample. The weights are based on the makeup of the U.S. population.\n\nThe U.S. population changes constantly, so the BLS updates these weights every January.\n\nAs a consequence, comparing data between December and January can lead to bad conclusions. Changes are not clear-cut signs of changes in economic conditions. They\u2019re distorted by changes in the weights. \u00a0\n\nThis is no secret. It\u2019s on the BLS news release. It\u2019s been standard practice for years.\n\nTo help policymakers get a handle on what\u2019s actually going on, the BLS issues alternative data that show what the numbers would be if the same population controls stayed the same.\n\nBy this measure, the number of people \"not in the workforce\" actually shrank by 75,000, said Barry Hirsch, a professor at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University.\n\n\"The [number of people] not in the labor force definitely went down, not up,\"\u00a0 Hirsch said.\n\nThere are other signs that the workforce is expanding. Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the Brookings Institution think tank, considered data for adults between 25 and 54. January\u2019s data indicated population control changes did not have as dramatic an effect on this group.\n\nIn this category, the number of employed rose 0.3 percentage points in January, reaching a level last seen in the summer of 2009. He believes other groups experienced similar improvements. \u00a0\n\n\"The favorable unemployment rate change reflected in the 2012 jobs report was mainly the result of increased employment, contrary to Speaker Gingrich\u2019s claim,\" Burtless said in an email.\n\nGingrich\u2019s claim that \"the biggest contribution\" behind easing unemployment \"was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce\" is based on a bad interpretation of the data that is easy to avoid.\n\nBLS numbers suggest the number of those not in the workforce is actually shrinking. Other measures support this conclusion.\n\nHow can the \"biggest contribution\" to a decline in unemployment be a shrinking workforce when the numbers suggest the opposite is taking place?\n\nGingrich earns a False.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11529"}
