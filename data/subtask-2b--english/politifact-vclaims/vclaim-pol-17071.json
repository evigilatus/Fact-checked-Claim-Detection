She DEMANDS MAIL IN VOTING or NO 2nd STIMULUS for you and your family.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis claim is inaccurate for a lot of reasons, but first some background.\nUnder a stimulus package signed into law in March, millions of out-of-work Americans were receiving an additional $600 per week to help them better manage the financial blow dealt by the coronavirus pandemic. Those checks expired at the end of July, and Washington lawmakers are embroiled in negotiations over what should be included in a new stimulus package.\nThe Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, also known as the HEROES Act, passed the Democrat-led House of Representatives more than two months ago. The Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection, and Schools Act, also called the HEALS Act, was introduced by Senate Republicans at the end of July but hasn\u2019t passed the Senate yet.\u00a0\nThere is a $2 trillion price difference between the two bills, but both offer the extension of stimulus checks from the CARES Act, with the HEROES Act upping the payment amount for dependents and extending the checks to immigrants with taxpayer identification numbers.\nNow, back to the claim that Pelosi\u00a0 \"demands\" mail-in voting and is \"blackmailing\" Congress.\u00a0\nPelosi said in April that the House\u2019s second stimulus package would \"be supporting vote by mail in a very important way.\" The stimulus proposal passed by the House doesn\u2019t include any legislation specific to mail-in voting, but it does fund elections generally. The bill includes up to $3.6 billion in funding for the \"planning, preparation, and resilience of elections,\" that would be distributed to states.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, state governors are the ones deciding how to conduct voting and if they will only have mail-in voting in November.\nCongress already allocated $400 million in election funding for states in the CARES Act, and there is bipartisan support for more funding for states considering mail-in or early voting. The Republican-backed Senate bill does not include any extra funding for election safety during COVID-19.\nFederal law describes blackmail as a criminal offense punishable by fine, up to a year in prison or both. It amounts to someone demanding money or something of value from another \"under threat of informing or consideration for not informing against a violation of any law of the United States.\"\nPelosi has shown support for mail-in voting. But there is no evidence or credible suggestion she has blackmailed anyone.\nFrances Hill, law professor at the University of Miami, describes Pelosi\u2019s negotiations with Republicans as \"playing hardball,\" which is \"routinely played by House Speakers\" and not considered \"blackmail.\"\n\"Voting is the foundation of our democracy and Congress has a duty to ensure that appropriate funding is available,\" she said.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claimed that Pelosi is \"blackmailing\" Congress by not allowing a second stimulus bill to pass unless everyone votes by mail.\nNot only are state governors the only ones deciding how each state will vote, but the HEROES Act Pelosi is negotiating includes state funding for safe voting without any reference to mail-in voting.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17071"}
