Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain in the third and final debate on Oct. 15, 2008,\u00a0was over the topic of negative ads.\n\n\nHere\u2019s how one exchange went:\n\n\nObama: \"And 100 percent, John, of your ads\u00a0\u2014 100 percent of them have been negative.\"\n\n\nMcCain: \"It\u2019s not true.\"\n\n\nObama: \"It absolutely is true.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can find the exchange on the YouTube version about 26:30 into the debate.)\n\n\nObama appears to be cherry-picking the ads run during a single week\u00a0\u2014 from Sept. 28 to Oct. 4\u00a0\u2014 during which the Wisconsin Advertising Project found \"nearly all\" of McCain\u2019s ads were negative. That week, they found that 34 percent of Obama\u2019s ads were negative.\n\n\nBut McCain has aired many, many ads that were not negative. If you look at a report from the same organization on Sept. 17, they found that in the week after the conventions, for example, Obama aired a higher percentage of negative ads than did McCain (76 percent to 56 percent).\u00a0\n\n\nIn all, the Wisconsin Advertising Project has found that\u00a073 percent of McCain\u2019s ads have been negative, to date. That's far short of 100 percent. (It also found 61 percent of Obama\u2019s ads have been negative.)\n\n\nThat\u2019s up for both parties from the 2004 election, when 64 percent of George Bush\u2019s ads were negative, compared to 34 percent of John Kerry\u2019s.\n\n\nSo Obama might be right for one week, but he is way off for the overall campaign, when McCain's negative ads accounted for 73 percent. That's so far off that we find it Pants on Fire wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15865"}
