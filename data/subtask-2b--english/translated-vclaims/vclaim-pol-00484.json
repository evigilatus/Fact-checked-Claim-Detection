This is the essence of a claim made by State Sin John Erbenbach, from the Western Region, during the debate on the State budget. He referred to the increase in the gas tax proposed by the Government. Tony Evers - and then rejected by Republican legislators - will bring extra money. \"If the drivers pay outside the state (gas tax), they will contribute $73 million to repair our roads,\" Irbenbach tweeted on June 6, 2019. Irbinbach &apos; s tweet was motivated by the actions of the Joint Finance Committee, which is under the control of the General Democratic Party, and whose road financing plan was budgeted instead of increasing the gas tax by 8 cents per gallon proposed by Evers. The budget that Gob is now over is in front of Evers. So let us pause for a moment and look at this aspect of the discussion. Are we really short of $73 million worth of revenue from out-of-state drivers because Evers' plan hasn't been adopted? The gas tax in Wisconsin is currently 32.9 cents per gallon. The 8 per cent increase for gallons was part of a larger proposal by Evers to link the tax to the consumer price index starting in spring 2020. The Governor also sought to raise registration fees for heavy trucks and transportation fees or to obtain original title to vehicles. Instead, the Republicans voted to increase title and registration fees. Under the Global Programme of Action plan, the ownership fee, which is paid when cars are purchased and sold, will increase by $95 from $69.50 to $164.50. Annual registration fees will increase by $10, from $75 to $85. Finally, light truck charges will be set at $100, with an increase of $25 for 4,500 pounds and a reduction of $55 for 10,000 pounds. When we arrived at Erbenbach's office, his assistant, Hannah Akbek, said his comment of $73 million came from a conversation with the Legislative Tax Office. On June 6, 2019, Akbek said, \"Tell the Democratic Legislative Tax Office that drivers outside the state pay between 10 and 15% of the vehicle fuel tax revenue. The tweet was based on the information provided.\" Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021 The Office considered the gold standard in State financial matters and confirmed that it had briefed Irbinbach and other Democrats on estimates of revenues derived from the percentage of extra-state drivers paying gas tax. We told the finance office that the figures they used for revenue estimates came from the Department of Transport and based on 2014 data. The Bureau used between 10% and 15% of gas tax revenues from drivers other than Wisconsin, but emphasized an average of 12%. In a separate document, the Department of Transport indicated that its figures were based on estimates. \"The Administration does not have direct data that can be used to determine the amount of fuel consumption of engines outside the state,\" read the document. \"But, based on a series of high-level assumptions about (vehicle miles), fuel procurement behaviour and the amount of taxed car fuel gallons consumed in Wisconsin in fiscal year 14, the Administration estimates that out-of-state vehicles accounted for about 12% of the vehicle fuel tax revenue.\" The math test for $73 million was used by Irbinbach at a level of 15%. That math makes sure. If the Evers plan is in place, the government gas tax increase will raise some $485 million for transport projects, according to the Wisconsin District Association. But remember: 15% is the upper end of the range. Both the Ministry of Labour and the Financial Office recommended that 12% be used for a more realistic projection. At this level, the increase that drivers will pay outside the state falls to about $58 million. The Governor, Erbenbach, claimed that if the increase in the gas tax existed, drivers outside the state would contribute $73 million to help repair Wisconsin roads. This is based on the high rate of 10% to 15% used by the Ministry of Transport. However, the Ministry of Labour and Economic Development and the Financial Office recommend that 12% be used as a more reasonable figure. This makes the calculation much lower. Our definition is often correct: \"The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\" That fits me right here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00484"}
