Zero. Zero in the last six months. So it makes it very clear where his priorities are.\"\n\nThe following day, the RNC released a graphic that provided some additional specifics. Over the last six months, the graphic said, Obama has golfed 10 times and held 106 fundraisers, but his jobs council has never met. The RNC supplemented this with a video that added a goofy soundtrack as well as audio and video of an exchange on this topic between reporters and White House press secretary Jay Carney.\n\nSeveral readers asked us to check this statistic. We won\u2019t pass judgment on how Obama should spend his time, but we will check the accuracy of the numbers.\n\nThe jobs council\n\nLet\u2019s start by explaining what the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness actually is. Its website explains that the panel was established \"to provide nonpartisan advice to the President\" on strengthening the economy and creating jobs.\n\nThe council is chaired by the chairman and CEO of General Electric, Jeffrey Immelt, and is populated by a variety of other business figures, such as former AOL chairman Steve Case, venture capitalist John Doerr, former Citigroup and Time Warner chairman Richard D. Parsons, as well as economist Laura D\u2019Andrea Tyson and AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.\n\nChecking the lack of recent meetings was straightforward. The council\u2019s own web page cites four meetings of the council so far -- Feb. 24, 2011, at the White House, June 13, 2011, in Durham, N.C., October 11, 2011, in Pittsburgh, and Jan. 17, 2012, at the White House.\n\nThe Web page does add that the council has also conducted \"18 listening and action sessions in communities around the country with businesses and local leaders\" and that it plans to hold more in the coming months. However, the Web page doesn\u2019t appear to consider these to be \"meetings,\" and since the most recent was just slightly over six months ago, the RNC\u2019s claim is correct.\n\nAsked about the lack of meetings in a July 18, 2012, press briefing, Carney said \"the president solicits and receives input and advice from members of his jobs council and others about economic initiatives all the time. \u2026 There\u2019s no specific reason (why they haven\u2019t met) except the president has obviously got a lot on his plate.\"\n\nGolf and fundraising\n\nFor statistics on Obama\u2019s golf and fundraising activities, we turned to the RNC, which provided us with an Excel spreadsheet they had compiled internally. We then double-checked the RNC\u2019s work.\n\nThere is no official tally of the president\u2019s daily activities. There is one tally that\u2019s unofficial but widely respected -- one compiled by longtime CBS News correspondent Mark Knoller.\n\nKnoller tweeted on June 12, 2012, that \"today's six events will bring to 160 the number of fundraisers Pres Obama has done since filing for re-election with the FEC last year.\" He also wrote in a story on June 17, 2012, that Obama had just played his 100th round of golf since taking office.\n\nHowever, because Knoller did not return an inquiry for this story, we could not match these numbers to the RNC\u2019s claim.\n\nThe RNC offered links to news accounts to back up Obama\u2019s 10 golf outings in the past six months, and they confirmed golf outings on the dates cited by the RNC count.\n\nAs for fundraising events, the RNC only provided dates and locations. However, we were able to check this list using two sources.\n\nThe White House\u2019s archive of presidential speeches and remarks offers chronological links to transcripts of the president\u2019s comments at every public appearance he makes. Many, though not all, fundraising events are included in this archive.\n\nMeanwhile, to track events that were closed to the press -- and thus wouldn\u2019t be included in the archive of speeches and remarks -- we relied on our personal archive of White House pool reports, which are the dispatches written by journalists covering the White House several times a day and distributed to all members of the White House press corps. These pool reports will typically mention that the president is attending a fundraiser even if the event is closed to the press.\n\nUsing these two sources, we were able to confirm virtually all of the fundraisers cited by the RNC. In only three cases were we unable to verify fundraisers cited by the RNC using these sources. This doesn\u2019t mean that these three events didn\u2019t happen; we just couldn\u2019t find pool reports that specifically backed them up. However, even if the actual number of fundraisers in the last six months turned out to be 103 rather than 106, we won\u2019t quibble -- the number would be close enough for us to consider it accurate.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe RNC said that over the last six months, Obama has golfed 10 times and held 106 fundraisers even as his jobs council didn\u2019t meet once. The RNC\u2019s tally is on target. We rate the statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
