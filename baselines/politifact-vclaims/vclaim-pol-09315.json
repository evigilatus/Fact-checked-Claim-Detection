First, it faced widespread criticism over revelations that officials gave extra scrutiny to tea party and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Now, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is charging that the IRS may be able to deny Americans the right to health care.\n\nDuring a May 15, 2013, interview on Fox News\u2019 On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, Bachmann linked the IRS to a longtime target of hers, President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nReferring to an inspector general\u2019s report on the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups, Bachmann said, \"So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll be looking at a few claims from this exchange. In this item, we\u2019ll focus on whether it\u2019s accurate to say that \"the IRS will have the ability potentially\" to deny or delay health care.\n\nIn an interview with PolitiFact after Bachmann\u2019s appearance on Van Susteren\u2019s show, Dan Kotman, a spokesman for Bachmann, said she stood by the concerns she expressed.\n\n\"Now that we know the IRS has abused its power for political purposes, it is reasonable to ask what other steps would they take to punish their political opponents,\" Kotman said. This is an especially big concern, Kotman said, in the wake of revelations that Sarah Hall Ingram -- the former commissioner of the IRS' tax-exempt and government-entities division -- is now in charge of an IRS office that oversees tax-related issues relating to the health care law.\n\nKotman argued that it would be possible for the IRS to use the information it collects on taxpayers and their health coverage for political purposes. \"Based on that information, one possible outcome is that they can levy punitive taxes that could force employers to drop coverage,\" Kotman said.\n\nThe IRS has a number of roles in implementing the health care law -- the agency has posted a list that includes everything from levying additional payroll taxes on certain high-income Americans to taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs. Its best known role, beginning in 2014, is to confirm that a taxpayer has health insurance and to assess a financial penalty if they do not. (The penalties start at $95 per adult in 2013 and rise to $695 per adult in 2016.)\n\nNone of the above, however, supports the idea that the IRS can \"deny\" or \"delay\" health care for an individual or a family.\n\nBut there is one area in which IRS actions could delay Americans from getting health care. It stems from the agency\u2019s role in approving federal subsidies for purchasing health insurance on the newly created insurance exchanges.\n\nLet\u2019s recap how this part of the law works. The law establishes \"exchanges\" that are intended to be operational by 2014. Using these exchanges, people who need insurance will be able to comparison-shop for plans that suit their needs. While some people will pay all of the resulting premiums, many will qualify for subsidies.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe subsidies operate on a sliding scale, and are available to those who earn between 133 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. An estimated 28.6 million Americans might be eligible for the subsidies in 2014, though the Congressional Budget Office has suggested that many fewer Americans will actually sign up, at least at first -- 6 million in 2014 and 22 million in 2017.\n\nEven if the lower estimates of signup rates are true, that will mean that millions of Americans will need to secure approval from the IRS to obtain subsidies. This process is supposed to start this fall, to enable applicants to purchase coverage in time for calendar year 2014.\n\nSo will the IRS be ready? An IRS spokeswoman said the agency \"is on track with implementing its role in the Affordable Care Act,\" but otherwise directed inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, HHS said applicants for financial assistance will be part of the exchange process and that verification \"will take place in near-real time\" with several federal databases, including an IRS database.\n\nExperts we contacted for this story said that Bachmann\u2019s scenario -- that the IRS picks and chooses who gets a subsidy based on an applicant\u2019s political beliefs -- is almost impossible to imagine, even after the recent revelations.\n\nBut they said it was more plausible that mundane logistical challenges could delay individuals\u2019 efforts to secure subsidies. At a bureaucracy as large as the IRS, and with laws as complicated as this one, it\u2019s possible that individuals could -- indirectly and inadvertently -- find themselves delayed or denied in getting health coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine glitches cropping up and delaying someone from getting approval to purchase insurance on the exchange. It could be especially tricky for Americans who don\u2019t file returns because they don\u2019t owe taxes beyond what\u2019s taken from their paycheck. We \"don\u2019t know what will happen if the IRS is unable to make these determinations in a \u2018timely' way,\" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and who is now a health policy consultant.\n\nAnd even in the best of situations, computer systems aren\u2019t perfect. \"One big concern about whether the exchanges will work is whether computers from different government agencies can talk to each other,\" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. Brookings Institution senior fellow Elaine Kamarck recently suggested a possible scenario in which the federal online system for exchanges \"may not be able to interface with statewide data and eligibility could become a lengthy bureaucratic process.\"\n\nWe should emphasize that if these delays do come to pass, it won\u2019t be about \"political beliefs,\" as Bachmann put it, and it won\u2019t be something IRS intended to happen. It would be about something much more mundane -- bureaucratic snags.\n\n\"She is trying to make the IRS sound like it has a malevolent power to limit medical care that it does not have,\" said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBachmann said \"the IRS will have the ability potentially\" to deny or delay health care. She makes it sound like the IRS would purposefully deny or delay people from getting health coverage, perhaps based on an applicant\u2019s political beliefs. Experts told us that was extremely far-fetched. But if complicated logistical challenges are not met, there is a chance that IRS could inadvertently end up delaying some of the millions of uninsured Americans seeking subsidies from purchasing insurance on the exchanges.
