Paul Ryan, R-Wis., recently took to Medium to set the stage for a forum in Columbia, S.C., on Republican efforts to fight poverty. The forum, hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation, drew six 2016 Republican presidential candidates \u2013\u00a0former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, retired physician Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\nIn his Medium column, Ryan wrote that a new direction was needed on government anti-poverty efforts.\n\"We\u2019ve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now,\" he wrote. \"And I don\u2019t think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, you\u2019re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago. I\u2019m not saying we haven\u2019t made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty\u200a\u2013\u00a0that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves.\"\nHere, we\u2019ll check Ryan\u2019s statement that \"today, if you were raised poor, you\u2019re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.\"\nWhen we asked Ryan\u2019s staff for their evidence, they pointed us to an academic paper by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, Emmanuel Saez\u00a0and Nicholas Turner, \"Is the United States Still a Land of Opportunity? Recent Trends in Intergenerational Mobility\" from January 2014. Chetty and Hendren are at Harvard, Kline and Saez are at the University of California-Berkeley, and Turner was with the U.S. Treasury Department.\nThe paper, based on extensive analysis of income and educational-attainment data, found that \"intergenerational mobility\" has \"remained extremely stable\" since the generation of Americans born in 1971.\n\"We find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s,\" the authors wrote.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we asked one of the co-authors, Saez, whether Ryan\u2019s summary left out anything important, he said no.\n\"Yes, this is broadly correct,\" Saez told PolitiFact. Saez said the paper shows the odds of staying in the bottom one-fifth of the income distribution when your parents were in the bottom one-fifth have stayed stable for the past four to five decades.\nThe paper and Saez in the interview both noted one caveat \u2013 that the consequences of the pattern Ryan is citing have worse effects today because inequality has grown over the same period.\n\"Because inequality has risen,\" the paper notes, \"the consequences of the \u2018birth lottery\u2019 \u2013 the parents to whom a child is born \u2013 are larger today than in the past.\"\nHowever, this caveat doesn\u2019t undermine Ryan\u2019s point. If anything, it accentuates it. (We're also not penalizing Ryan for rounding up the study's length to 50 years.)\nTara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed, said the paper Ryan chose is a credible one within the profession. \"These are the authors I would turn to\" when looking at intergenerational mobility.\nOur ruling\nRyan wrote that \"today, if you were raised poor, you\u2019re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.\" His support for this claim\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a respected academic paper published in 2014 \u2013\u00a0found exactly what Ryan described.
