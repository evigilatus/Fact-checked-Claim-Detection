Bruce Rauner took office in January 2015.\nMendoza\u2019s office issued a statement, stating \"Every state vehicle is paid for with taxpayer funds, including the bigger fleet in which the Governor\u2019s security detail drives him \u2013 and all the state agencies controlled by the Governor. The various offices of state government have purchased more than $11 million in vehicles, not counting leases, for use from the Governor on down during the last two years.\"\nGiven that Illinois remains embroiled in an unprecedented budget impasse that has caused the unpaid bill backlog to swell to nearly\u00a0$12 billion, we checked into Mendoza\u2019s claim to verify the $11 million figure.\nThe comptroller\u2019s statement also comes with a not-so-subtle implication that the governor himself authorized the $11 million in vehicle purchases, which we looked into as well.\nChecking the comptroller\u2019s checkbook \nThe Chicago-Sun Times first reported Mendoza\u2019s office purchased a used 2016 Ford Explorer with about 16,500 miles from a central Illinois dealership to replace an old vehicle that was \"in need of many expensive repairs before it would be safe to drive,\" according to spokesman Abdon Pallasch.\u00a0\nOne of the more notable parts from the comptroller's response was the amount of money state agencies have spent on vehicles during most of the budget stalemate.\nJamey Dunn, deputy director of communications for the comptroller\u2019s office, clarified that the last two years referred to in the press release are from January 2015 \u2014 when Rauner took office \u2014 to February 2017.\nMendoza\u2019s statement also notes all state vehicles are paid for with taxpayer dollars, including those purchased by \"all the state agencies controlled by the Governor,\" which suggests the Rauner administration is responsible for all the vehicle spending by the various departments.\nIn response to the comptroller\u2019s statement, Rauner\u2019s director of communications, Brad Hahn, said comparing the comptroller\u2019s small fleet of vehicles to other larger, state agencies is \"completely different.\"\nMendoza is the keeper of the state\u2019s checkbook and records of expenditures are readily available on the comptroller\u2019s website.\nWe used the comptroller\u2019s Ledger database to search for expenditures on the official category of \"passenger automobiles\" by state agency as well as by month.\nIn fiscal year 2015, state government spent $10.23 million on vehicles, with the Illinois State Police accounting for $6.1 million, or about 60 percent of the total.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Rauner\n\n\nstated on June 1, 2016 in a press conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago in Illinois ...\u00a0because of the control of (House) Speaker (Michael) Madigan and his Democrats.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Matt Dietrich \u2022 July 13, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the time Rauner was in office that fiscal year \u2014 between January and June 2015 \u2014 state spending on vehicles was $7.09 million. That includes lapse period spending, which allows state agencies to use the previous year\u2019s spending authority to pay for that year\u2019s bills during the first two months of the current fiscal year.\nAccording to the Department of Central Management Services, ISP purchased more than 100 vehicles in FY2015 as part of critical update to its fleet. About half of the total amount spent \u2014 $3.05 million \u2014 occurred under Rauner.\nHowever, Hahn said the governor doesn\u2019t sign off on new cars bought by ISP or other state agencies. \u00a0\nAfter Rauner took office in the second half of FY 2015, CMS spent more than $2.9 million, which was used to purchase vehicles for the departments of juvenile justice, corrections, human services and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.\nExpenditures decreased significantly during fiscal year 2016 to $3.19 million. Eighty-six percent of that spending came from the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, which purchased more than $2.3 million in vehicles in February 2016, the same month state procurement records show the agency awarded a contract for 63 light-duty trucks that were to be \"outfitted with a wide array of emergency lighting, radios, arrow and/or message sign boards, lift gates, and other enhancements to meet the Tollway\u2019s requirements.\"\nSpending in the current fiscal year totaled $1.8 million as of March, with the Illinois Department of Transportation purchasing more than $874,000 in vehicles and nearly $528,000 by the Secretary of State\u2019s office.\nKelsea Gurski, bureau chief of communication services for IDOT, said the department purchased 56 light-fleet vehicles such as sedans and minivans to update its existing, \"depleted\" fleet, but that the purchases did not increase the size of the fleet. \u00a0\n\"These purchases were part of a much-needed update to our agency\u2019s depleted fleet; many of our older vehicles required repairs that exceeded their value or had rust-related damage that made them unsafe to drive,\" Gurski said. \"IDOT\u2019s light-fleet vehicles are used for transportation for technical staff to worksites, meetings, seminars and training.\"\nAdded together, the total amount state government has spent on vehicles since Rauner has been in office and at the time of the comptroller\u2019s statement is $11.91 million. \u00a0\u00a0\nOur rating \nAfter being criticized by the Illinois GOP for purchasing a $32,000 used SUV, Comptroller Susana Mendoza issued a statement noting the various offices of state government have purchased more than $11 million in vehicles since Rauner became governor in January 2015.\nA search of expenditures through the comptroller\u2019s Ledger database shows state agencies have spent more than $11 million on cars during Rauner\u2019s time in office and throughout much of the budget impasse.\nBut after being attacked herself by the Illinois Republican Party, Mendoza incorrectly implies that Rauner had a direct role in the more than $11 million in vehicle purchases by the state government since he took office.\nWe rate Mendoza\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    1 6  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  \"The various offices of state government have purchased more than $11 million in vehicles, not counting leases, for use from the Governor on down during the last two years.\"    Susana Mendoza Illinois Comptroller   in a press release Sunday, February 19, 2017 02/19/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03606"}
