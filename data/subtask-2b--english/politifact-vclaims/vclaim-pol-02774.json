Robert E. Lee from a public park in Charlottesville, Va. The white nationalists were met by a crowd of about 1,000 counter-protesters. After the rally dispersed, a car plowed into a group near the city\u2019s downtown mall, killing a 32-year-old woman.\nTwo weeks later, on Aug. 26, 2017, a Baltimore man identified as a Klan imperial wizard was arrested and charged with firing a gun during the rally.\nIt was in this atmosphere that Madison Mayor Paul Soglin announced the removal of two Confederate memorials from the city\u2019s Forest Hill Cemetery. A total of 140 Confederate soldiers -- prisoners of war who died at Camp Randall -- are buried in the cemetery.\nAfter the announcement, a ground-level \"Confederate Rest\" plaque installed in 1981 was removed. The fate of a larger, 4-foot tall monument installed in 1931 has been referred to the Common Council, while the debate over what to do with it continues.\nSoglin\u2019s initial order prompted a news release from the Republican Party of Dane County, in which Chairman Scott Grabins scolded Soglin for an \"antiseptic wipe to the memory of American voters.\" \u00a0\nThe Aug. 25, 2017 \u00a0release went on to cite various historical instances where Democrats opposed civil rights initiatives, ending the list with this assertion: \"The KKK was founded as the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"\nWhen asked to back up the party\u2019s claim, Grabins said the history of the Klan is well-known and cited the History.com website\u2019s entry on the KKK.\nLet\u2019s go to the history books.\nKlan history\nAccording to a History.com entry on the Klan:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounded in 1866, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) extended into almost every southern state by 1870 and became a vehicle for white southern resistance to the Republican Party\u2019s Reconstruction-era policies aimed at establishing political and economic equality for blacks. Its members waged an underground campaign of intimidation and violence directed at white and black Republican leaders.\nThough Congress passed legislation designed to curb Klan terrorism, the organization saw its primary goal \u2013 the reestablishment of white supremacy \u2013 fulfilled through Democratic victories in state legislatures across the South in the 1870s. \nHistorians weigh in\nJames Marten, an author and chairman of the history department at Marquette University, disputed the Dane County GOP claim the Klan was \"founded\" as the military arm of the Democratic party.\n\"It was at its simplest a secret fraternal organization, but it very quickly became an organization dedicated to preserving white supremacy and intimidating African Americans,\" he said. \"They and other groups like them broke up schools, torched houses, and interfered with black social and church gatherings. \u00a0\n\"And, along with those other groups as well as individuals and gangs, committed thousands of acts of terror, violence, and murder throughout the South. However, the early Klan \u2014 the founding generation of the Klan \u2014 really only lasted into the 1870s before it was driven underground, and it was not an overtly political organization.\"\nEric Foner, a Columbia University history professor, noted the Klan was a \"military force.\"\n\"In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic party, the planter class, and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy,\" he said. \"Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society.\"\nBut serving the interests of the party is not the same as being part of the party. Consider the political landscape today, where super PACs and other entities work outside the formal party structure.\nIn a June 10, 2013, PolitiFact Virginia article, Carole Emberton, associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo, noted that the \"party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today.\"\n\"Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white \u2018Dixiecrats\u2019 flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\" she said. \"By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of \u2018reform,\u2019 supporting a variety of \u2018liberal\u2019 causes, including civil rights, women\u2019s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century.\"\nOur rating\nThe Republican Party of Dane County claimed \"the KKK was founded as the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"\nThere is little doubt that the political interests of the Klan and the Democratic Party, at least in the early years, intersected. But there is no evidence that it was founded as part of the Democratic Party, or that the party ever even had an official \"military arm.\"\nIf a Democrat today claimed the KKK is the military arm of the Republican Party, we\u2019d have a similar point of view.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02774"}
