Only one person died on that day. You know who it was? The unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt. Unarmed woman shot and killed by Capitol Police.\"\n\nKelly was wrong about the Capitol siege\u2019s human toll. A spokesperson for Newsmax declined to comment.\nIn addition to Babbitt, three others died Jan. 6 from medical emergencies suffered during the riot, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed. A fifth person, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, died the next day after responding to the riot.\nTwo other officers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 \u2014 D.C. police officer Jeffery Smith and Capitol Police officer Howard Liebengood \u2014 died by suicide in the weeks that followed, acting Metropolitan Police Chief Robert J. Contee III said Jan. 26 in testimony before Congress.\nThe head of the Capitol Police officers\u2019 union said about 140 officers were injured.\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran and supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she climbed through a smashed door leading to the hallway outside the House chambers. Her death was captured on video.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the New York Times and other news outlets, the three other Trump supporters who died during the events included 55-year-old Kevin Greeson of Alabama, who suffered a heart attack; 50-year-old Benjamin Philips of Pennsylvania, who suffered a stroke; and 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland of Georgia, who died as fellow rioters fought through a police line.\u00a0\nA friend who was with Boyland told WGCL-TV she was pinned to the ground and trampled by fellow rioters, which lines up with the New York Times\u2019 reporting based on videos from the event that she \"died after losing consciousness in the crush of a pro-Trump mob.\" An incident report published by Snopes said officers dispatched to the Capitol found her collapsed and receiving CPR.\nContee reported all four deaths in a press conference Jan. 6. News reports from the day, including a fact-check from PolitiFact, also said four people had died in the violence.\nCapitol Police announced Sicknick\u2019s death in a press release Jan. 7, writing that the officer died at roughly 9:30 p.m. that day \"due to injuries sustained while on-duty.\" Sicknick was injured while \"physically engaging with protesters\" on Jan. 6, and he collapsed after he returned to his division office, the press release said.\nInvestigations into Sicknick\u2019s death are ongoing.\nOur ruling\nKelly said, \"It's not true (that five people died on Jan. 6). Only one person died on that day. You know who it was? The unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt.\"\nThat\u2019s inaccurate. Four people died at the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer, died the following day after he was injured in the violence.\nWe rate Kelly\u2019s statement False.\nIf you or people you know are thinking about suicide, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text the Crisis Text Line at 741-741.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19101"}
