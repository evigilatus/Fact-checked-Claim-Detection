In addition to being diagnosed with quadriplegia, he also suffered trauma in his neck, causing irreversible damage to his larynx, leaving both vocal cords paralyzed.\"\nIt then credits the statement found in the Facebook post to an unnamed Hart representative.\nThe website attempts to make it look like it posts legitimate entertainment news, but buried at the very bottom of the page in tiny, barely legible writing (3.5 font size to be exact) is a disclaimer that everything on the site is satire:\u00a0\n\"THE STORIES POSTED ON LFRSOLUTIONS.COM ARE FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY.
