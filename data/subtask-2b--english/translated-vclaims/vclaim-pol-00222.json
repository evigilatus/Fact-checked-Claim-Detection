Other members of the G-7 gave the idea a great reception. During a question-and-answer session with journalists in the aftermath of the Summit, Trump was asked to do so. \"Why do you think it's appropriate to invite Russia to the G-7, since they intervened in the 2016 election? Are you concerned that if Russia comes to the G-7, it could hurt you politically, because it will only be a few months before the 2020 elections? Trump said it would be better for Russia to be inside the room outside, but then he shifted his focus to his predecessor, President Barack Obama. Trump said, \"Many bad things have happened with President Putin and President Obama.\" The Crimean Trump male, a peninsula located in the Black Sea. Following the overthrow of Ukraine &apos; s pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces invaded Crimea in 2014 and officially absorbed it in Russia. (Until 1954, Crimea was formerly part of Russia). Trump said, \"She's been taken from President Obama.\" It wasn't from President Trump. It was from President Obama. President Obama was not happy that this happened because he was embarrassed for him. Yeah? It was so embarrassing for him. He wanted Russia to get out of what was called the Group of Eight. That was his design. He was smarter than Putin. He was so smart. President Putin outstripped President Obama. The experts contacted by Polyte Fact said that Trump &apos; s statement was full of misleading allegations. To begin with, it invaded Russia and eventually included Crimea during Obama &apos; s presidency - in February and March 2014. But Russia did not take Crimea away from Obama or the United States - it took the region away from Ukraine, of which it was an internationally recognized part. The Trump statement was \"a very strange way of thinking about Crimea and the role of the United States in Ukraine,\" as Susan Wingle said, a politician at Notre Dame University. \"It is very misleading and factually incorrect. The United States has exercised certain influence between certain Kiev and Ukrainian politicians - to what extent and by whom - but the United States has never \"owned\" Crimea. Moreover, the wording of Tramp - \"something taken away\" - alleviates Russia's coercive measures in seizing Crimea, as stated by Anders Aslund, a senior colleague of the Atlantic Council. \"That's not what you call military occupation,\" said Asland. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2021, it should also be noted that despite Trump's focus on his predecessor, Obama was not alone in opposing the annexation of Russia. The entire world community almost refuses to recognize this annexation, which has been the first such takeover in Europe since the end of the cold war. \"Europe, the United Nations and other United States allies opposed invasion and annexation,\" said Yoshiko Herrera, a political scientist from the University of Wisconsin. \"It wasn't just Obama who opposed it.\" What Trump said raised problems for other reasons. While the Obama administration supported the expulsion of Russia from the G-8 because of the annexation of Crimea, it did not do so unilaterally, and in fact could not act unilaterally. \"The Group of Seven was united by the decision to expel Russia from the Group of Eight, so it was a joint decision by consensus,\" said Aslund. In a statement dated 24 March 2014, the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Council of Europe and the European Commission jointly wrote that they \"strongly condemn\" Russia's actions in Crimea. The signatories agreed that they would not participate in the G-8 meeting to be held in Sochi, Russia, and that they would \"stop our participation in the G-8 until Russia changes course and the environment returns to where the G-8 can have a meaningful discussion.\" To date, the G-8 has not invited Russia to return to its hangar. In general, \"Trump seems to have difficulty believing that there is any other reason than to be embarrassed to oppose the aggression and territorial fragmentation of a major European State,\" said Steve Sistanovich, a senior colleague in Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council of Foreign Relations. Our verdict, Trump, said Crime was taken from President Obama. He wanted Russia out of what was called the G8. This was his design.\" Obama opposed the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia and retracted its expulsion from the G-8, but Tramp's point of view ignores much of the story. The Tramp observation ignores both the widespread opposition to Russian action within Europe and among United States allies, as well as the strongly drafted decision by the other G-7 States to expel Russia from the group. It also ignores the fact that Crimea was \"taken away\" from Ukraine, not Obama. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00222"}
