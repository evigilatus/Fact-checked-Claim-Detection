The posts share the following words:\n\"There will be a twin year (2020) from which will arise a queen (corona) who will come from the east (China) and who will spread a plague (virus) in the darkness of night, on a country with 7 hills (Italy) and will transform the twilight of men into dust (death), to destroy and ruin the world. It will be the end of the world economy as you know it.\n\nWe could find no passages in Nostradamus\u2019 collective works that resemble these words.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
