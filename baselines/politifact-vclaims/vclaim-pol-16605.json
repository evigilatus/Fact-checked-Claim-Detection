Mike Gravel attacked the Iraq war during a recent debate by highlighting the increasing costs.\n\n\"Stop and think,\" he said at Howard University on June 28, 2007. \"When he's talking about the money we're squandering, 21-million Americans could have a four-year college scholarship for the money we've squandered in Iraq. 7.6-million teachers could have been hired last year if we weren't squandering this money.\"\n\n\nGravel's campaign staff didn't respond to numerous requests for documentation supporting those numbers. They couldn't even say how much they think the Iraq war costs.\n\n\nBut we researched the numbers anyway and found that in making his comparison he goes too high on one and too low on the other. Ruling? Half true.\n\n\nWe interpreted his assertion to mean that the Iraq war budget would pay for the scholarships or the teachers' salaries, rather than both.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Do the math: the sum exceeds $490.2-billion, much higher than even the highest estimate.\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education reports the average teacher salary was $47,750 in 2005, the most recent year available. That produces a total of $363-billion, well below the lowest estimate.\n\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office conservatively estimates the entire bill for the Iraq war since 2001 is $413-billion. The Congressional research did its own calculation to show that the price tag to date is $450.4-billion.\n\n\nSo Gravel's comparisons are at once exaggerated and underestimated, but they are within the same range of the projected costs.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16605"}
