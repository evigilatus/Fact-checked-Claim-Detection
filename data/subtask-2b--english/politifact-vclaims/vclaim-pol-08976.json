Scott Walker\u2019s campaign talked up his record on budgets, taxes and jobs.\n\"Gov. Walker has balanced a $3.6 billion deficit, cut income taxes and Wisconsin has seen its best two-year job growth in a decade,\" Walker\u2019s campaign told reporters on July 29, 2013. \"We\u2019re confident that all voters want to continue moving forward and have no desire to return to the failed policies of the past.\"\nWe heard the same claim by Walker\u2019s campaign in early August.\nWe\u2019ve previously tested Walker\u2019s deficit and income-tax claims -- the governor accurately claims credit on both -- and many of the Republican governor\u2019s jobs claims while tracking his promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs by January 2015.\nBut the \"best two-year job growth in a decade\" is a new one, and one voters are likely to hear repeatedly as the election nears.\nSo let\u2019s test it.\nWalker is referring to 2011 and 2012, his first two years in office.\nTo examine the decade, we\u2019ll use the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, a thorough jobs count that economists, state and federal jobs officials and the Walker administration agree is the most accurate source. The figures, based on reports from more than 90% of public and private employers, are gathered by the state, then adjusted and published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe latest state-by-state figures through 2012 came out in mid-2013, prompting Walker to highlight the state\u2019s improvement from 44th in job-creation to 33rd among the states.\nWalker\u2019s new campaign claim isn\u2019t specific to private-sector jobs or all jobs, so we\u2019ll examine both the private world and the broader employment picture, including government jobs, though we note that Walker\u2019s 250,000 promise was for the private side only.\nWe went back to 2002 to get enough data to measure the changes in the last decade, so the baseline was the final year of Republican Gov. Scott McCallum\u2019s brief tenure. The 2003-2010 figures belong to the era of Walker\u2019s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle.\nThe most important number is 62,082 -- that\u2019s how many more private-sector jobs existed at the end of December 2012 compared to the end of December 2010 -- the first two years of the Walker era. Walker was sworn in Jan. 3, 2011.\nIs it the best two-year period in the last decade?\nWisconsin actually lost ground at times in the decade, most notably in 2008 and 2009 amid the worst effects of the prolonged national downturn dubbed the Great Recession. From the end of 2007 to the end of 2009, the private job tally in Wisconsin fell by a whopping 175,000 -- a drop of 7 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoyle, we found, can\u2019t claim a better two-year period than Walker\u2019s 62,082 gain in private-sector jobs.\nBut there is a two-year period that tops that -- December 2009 to December 2011, when the private jobs count jumped by 63,458.\nThat period encompasses Doyle\u2019s final year in office and Walker\u2019s first, both of which came after the official end of the recession in mid-2009.\nThe state\u2019s employment turnaround began in 2010, Doyle\u2019s final year, when the count jumped by more than 33,600, mirroring national gains. It has continued under Walker, though at a slightly slower pace in raw numbers. By comparison, the gains in Walker\u2019s first two years were 29,800 and 32,282, respectively.\nWhat about the broader job count, including both the private and public sectors?\nWe found two earlier periods that top Walker\u2019s two-year mark on the combined total of private and public-sector jobs. The Walker-era total was 53,564. Before the recession, from the end of 2003 to the end of 2005 -- in Doyle\u2019s era -- the job count grew by 58,062. The other total that topped 2011-12 was post-recession, in the Doyle-Walker period of 2010 and 2011.\nThe bottom line here: Walker\u2019s campaign claim falls short.\nIn researching this item, we found earlier instances in which Walker made a similar claim, but in more precise and political terms. Example: In May 2013, the spokesman for Walker\u2019s office told the Journal Sentinel: \"Today, Wisconsin's private-sector job growth is the best two-year gain under any governor in over a decade.\"\nFor this fact check, the Walker campaign pointed us to that same statement, made by the state\u2019s workforce development agency.\nBut that qualifier -- \"any governor\" -- makes a difference in the accuracy of the claim. As we\u2019ve said, viewed that way, and looking at private-sector jobs only, Walker\u2019s two years run ahead of any similar period under Doyle. A Journal Sentinel story in May also reached that conclusion.\nVoters are likely to hear that more precise claim as well in this election season.\nSo consider that a bonus fact check.\nOur rating\n\"Wisconsin has seen its best two-year job growth in a decade,\" the Walker campaign told reporters in late July and early August.\nNot true, we found: Private job growth was higher in 2010-11, in the final year of Doyle and the first year under Walker. And total employment including government jobs rose faster from 2003-05 and 2010-11 than in the two-year Walker period.\nWe rate his claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08976"}
