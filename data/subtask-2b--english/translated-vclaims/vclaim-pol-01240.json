On its website, the Group notes that the two dominant State energy companies, Dominicon Energy and Apalashian Energy, which together provide 82 per cent of Virginia's power and have contributed $12 million to state candidates since 1996, have played a key role in the drafting of laws governing them. As a result, \"Virginians paid the 11 highest energy bills in the nation,\" says Clean Virginia. We asked whether this arrangement is correct. We were curious about the November 16th column of Roanoke by Mr. John Watkins, R. Chesterfield. He said the numbers were misleading and accused clean Virginia of trying to show dominance. Brennen Gilmore, Executive Director of the Group, referred us to data on the use of residential energy collected by the United States Energy Information Department. It shows that the population of the Virgin Islands received an average housing electricity bill of $124.54 per month in 2017. This was, in fact, the highest number 11 between all the states and the province of Colombia. But there's a warning that Virginia's clean site is being deleted. Energy bills are generally calculated by multiplying two figures: the cost rate of 1 kilowatt of energy per hour multiplied by the number of kilowatt hours used. The average residence rate in Virginia is 11.55 per kilowatt hour, the lowest 17 per cent in the country. On the contrary, the average household use of 1,078 kWh per month is the eighth highest. In other words, the driving force behind the rise in Virginia housing bills is not the rate; it is the intensive use of electricity. Environmental impact assessment schemes show a similar pattern throughout the country. In states where energy is relatively inexpensive, households typically consume more electricity than in expensive states. For example, Virginians use more than twice the power consumed by families in Vermont and Hawaii, which pay some of the highest rates in the country. When the environmental impact assessment is divided into 10 national regions, the ranking of areas by housing rates is the opposite of their exact order of use. In general, the highest rates are found in the coldest regions. The highest consumption is in the mid-Atlantic and southern regions from Delaware to Texas. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2020, we asked David Jonas, the Clean Virginia Policy Manager, if he agreed that Virginia's high electricity bills were driven by high consumption. \"Sure, you're right to point that out,\" he said. Jonas added that Dominic could reduce his housing rates by promoting greater energy efficiency. He referred to a study carried out by the American Council for Energy Efficiency in 2017, a Washington research group. Dominic ranked efficiency policies in the 50th largest 51 energy companies in the country. \"Virginians pay the highest 11 power bills in the country.\" Virginia has the highest housing capacity in the country, according to federal government statistics 2017. But there's a lot in this arrangement that clean Virginia ignores an attempt to bill as proof that Virginia's regulation of energy companies is \"fixed\" against consumers and \"bad.\" The rise in electricity prices is not due to the rise in electricity prices, which is determined in negotiations between energy companies, regulators, state politicians and other parties. On the contrary, Virginia has 17 lowest housing rates. What pays the large bills is the high consumption of electricity by Virginia's families, which, on average, use the eighth power in the country. This follows a pattern throughout the United States; states with low housing rates use much electricity and vice versa. Clean Virginia tells half the story, and we appreciate her half-right statement. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6dbfe3d9-5f9-42ea-a24-ff00d3ac0d84", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01240"}
