On the Donald Trump side, the article highlights his partial quote from a press conference that there were \"good people on both sides\" after a white extremist rally in Charlottesville, Fa. Under a picture of Fred Trump, the text states that \"he was arrested for participating in a KKK riot\" in 1927. The article contains some elements of truth about Fred Trump: he was arrested that year because of a clash between the Kurdistan Party and the police in the middle of a procession in Queens. But the article goes beyond what's known about his actions to say he was a participant. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The White House spokesman didn't comment on the story. The story of Fred Trump's arrest at the KKK rally challenged journalists even before his son entered the presidential race in 2016. The KKK riot broke out on May 30, 1927, the Memorial Day parade in Jamaica, Queens, N.Y., according to archives from Brooklyn Daily Eagle. A week ago, Police Commissioner Joseph Warren was warned that Klan intended to parade in the hoods and the dresses. Warren said that they had not been granted a procession permit, but a subsequent report that the Kurdistan Party had obtained permission from the large army of the Republic, an organization of veterans responsible for the review arrangements. However, on the day of the presentation, the police were unable to prevent at least 1,000 Klsmen from participating. The New York Times reported that \"1,000 Klinsman and 100 cops organized a free fight for all in Jamaica.\" Fred Trump, then 21, was arrested in a parade along with six others, according to The New York Times. (His address was 175-25 Devonshire Road, Jamaica, which corresponds to the 1930 census. However, unlike the other men who were arrested who faced various charges of assault and disorderly behaviour, the Times reported that Trump was \"discharged.\" We examined other reports of the riot to find more information - and we found some inconsistencies. On May 31, 1927, an article in Brooklyn Daily Eagle named six prisoners, all except for one, the passerby Ralph Lucy, However, this article did not mention the name Trump. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, according to Daily Star, Trump was \"dismissed for refusing to separate from a parade when ordered to do so.\" On June 2, 1927, the Long Island Dailys article says, \"Seven oppressed marchers\" were arrested. So Fred Trump might have been wearing a Klansman dress. Alberto Mart\u00ednez, Professor of History at the University of Texas, Austin, wrote his in-depth report on the arrest of Fred. \"Even if Fred Trump was involved in the riots, it does not necessarily mean that he was a member of the PKK or a marcher, because news reports and court records specify that local viewers (men and women) were involved in disrupting the parade,\" Martinez wrote in an e-mail. In addition, he said that only Fred Trump had been arrested and released immediately without charge. Martinez said that the conduct of the police officers made him question whether Fred Trump was involved. Martinez wrote: \"The Grand Jury of Queens accused the police of shameful assault not only on the marchers but also on innocent civilians along the march line\" in the parade. A police car, an innocent passerby arrested, and several minors were injured by the police. The president of the Queens' Grand Jury Association said: \"The police have committed unjustifiable atrocities and should be condemned.\" \"These points show that the police clashed not only with KKK, but also with innocent bystanders, which once again calls into question whether Fred Trump necessarily walked KKK or a local bystander,\" was written by Martinez. Our verdict in a Facebook photo called Fred Trump was arrested for \"sharing\" in a KKK riot. Yeah, Trump's dad was arrested for showing up at the memorial parade. The group &apos; s march led to a violent confrontation with the police. However, there is insufficient documentation indicating Trump &apos; s involvement. Unlike the other men who were arrested that day, his charge was dropped quickly. This article extends to what is known about the events of that day to make a misleading impression. We're assessing this mostly wrong. Sharing the facts 2019-03-28 18:01 UTC PoliticsFact 3 1 7 PoliticsFact Dating: A liar often says Fred Trump was arrested for \"participation in KKK riots\" in 1927.
