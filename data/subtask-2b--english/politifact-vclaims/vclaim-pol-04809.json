Trump faces a pending lawsuit against his eponymous Trump University.\nAs a \"recovering lawyer,\" Chabot wrote, \"settle the damn case, and apologize to the judge.\"\nEarlier this month, Trump caused the GOP heartburn when he accused the federal judge over the case of being unfair because of his Mexican heritage. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, is a first-generation U.S. citizen, born in Indiana to Mexican parents.\nChabot advised Trump to throw a blanket over his sticky legal situation ASAP, because, \"when it comes to ripping off the public, you\u2019re a piker compared to Hillary and Bill Clinton.\"\n(Definition of piker: a small-time gambler.)\nChabot continued:\nEven the Obama Administration recognized the inherent conflict of interest issues with respect to the Clinton Foundation, and therefore recommended a ban on all contributions to the Foundation from foreign nations. The Clintons violated that ban time and time again, and accepted millions and millions of dollars from governments like Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and United Arab Emirates.\nWe\u2019re going to unpack that statement to see if the Clinton Foundation did violate a ban and accept millions.\n\u2018Ban\u2019 on foreign donations\nWhen the Obamas were prepping for their move into the White House in 2008, and Hillary Clinton was awaiting confirmation to the cabinet as secretary of state, Barack Obama\u2019s Presidential Transitions Team and the CEO of the Clinton Foundation drew up a Memorandum of Understanding, with provisions to deal with conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts.\nIn the memorandum, the foundation pledged to publish its contributions from 2008, ahead of Hillary Clinton\u2019s confirmation as secretary of state. For the duration of Hillary Clinton\u2019s service at the State Department, the memorandum said, the foundation would seek approval from the State Department\u2019s ethics office before accepting donations from new foreign interests that hadn\u2019t given in the past, or from past donors who upped their contributions from previous levels.\nNowhere in the memorandum does the word \"ban\" appear. Memorandums of understanding are generally not legally binding.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Millions and millions?\u2019 \u2018Again and again?\u2019\nThe Clinton Foundation accepted millions of dollars from Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Qatar and Oman, which was allowed under the terms of the memorandum because they were previous donors.\nOman is the only country included in Chabot\u2019s blogged complaint. According to the foundation\u2019s website, the Sultanate of Oman donated between $1 million and $5 million while Clinton was at the State Department (the foundation discloses its funding in ranges). This donation was not prohibited by the memorandum.\nThe Washington Post\u00a0reported that the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia did not donate to the\u00a0Clinton Foundation until after Clinton left the secretary of state\u2019s post, in 2013. Our own reporting found the same thing.\u00a0\nThat leaves Algeria.\nAlgeria!\nOn Jan.\u00a012, 2010, the day after a massive earthquake struck Haiti,\u00a0Clinton Foundation officials admitted\u00a0that they failed to seek State Department approval before accepting an unsolicited donation from the Embassy of Algeria of $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund.\nThe foundation staff told us the foundation did not seek pre-approval in part because it did not have prior knowledge of Algeria\u2019s intended contribution and in part because of the urgency of Haiti\u2019s needs. The donation was disclosed on the foundation\u2019s website.\nOur ruling\nChabot wrote, \"The Clintons violated that ban time and time again, and accepted millions and millions of dollars from governments like Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Oman and United Arab Emirates.\"\nThe agreement, a memorandum of understanding, was not a ban. At the very least, the Clinton Foundation accepted $1.5 million from Algeria and Oman, and at most, $5.5 million. Oman\u2019s donation was allowed under the memo\u2019s terms, but Algeria\u2019s was not. Is the amount likely \"millions and millions?\" Probably.\nThe Clinton Foundation has accepted funds from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, too, but not while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.\nWe rate his statement Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c643bdb6-f953-4775-afb7-95d0cfdb2227", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04809"}
