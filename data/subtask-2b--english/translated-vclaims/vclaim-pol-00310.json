Guliani Girl,\" a follow-up to their successful video \"I got a crush on Obama,\" Amber Le Ettinger offered to write lips about the Democratic presidential candidate. In the discussion video, another dancer was introduced and the two argue about the merits of their candidates.

The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, Giuliani married his second cousin, Regina Beroogie, who was the daughter of his father's first cousin. \u2219 (Think of your son/daughter marrying your cousin/daughter.) Juliani at various points described the family connection as \"second cousins once\" and \"third cousins,\" before correcting it, according to the news reports.
