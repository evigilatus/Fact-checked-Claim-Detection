You Americans are so gullible. No, you won't accept communism outright; but, we will keep feeding you small doses of socialism until you will finally wake up and find you already have Communism.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThere is no evidence Khrushchev, who led the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, ever said this about Americans, though this quote and similar ones have been attributed to Khrushchev by people including President Ronald Reagan and staunch anti-communist Ezra Taft Benson, former secretary of agriculture.\nPolitiFact attempted to reach out to Haley on social media and through the organization she founded, Stand For America, to see if she had evidence to back up her claim. She did not respond to our request for comment.\nIn the Nikita Khrushchev section of a book titled \"They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions,\" a version of this quote is listed:\n\n\n\"You Americans are so gullible. No, you won\u2019t accept Communism outright, but we\u2019ll keep feeding you small doses of Socialism until you\u2019ll finally wake up and find you already have Communism. We won\u2019t have to fight you. We\u2019ll so weaken your economy until you\u2019ll fall like an overripe fruit into our hands.\"\n\n\nAccording to the book, the quote emerged and began circulating in the 1960s.\u00a0\nIn 1961, Reagan \u2014 who was an actor and TV host at the time \u2014 attributed a version of the quote to Khrushchev in a speech, without providing evidence of its origin:\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Three months before his last visit to this country, Nikita Khrushchev said, \u2018We can't expect the American people to jump from capitalism to communism, but we can assist their elected leaders in giving them small doses of socialism, until they awaken one day to find they have communism.\u2019\"\nIn the late 1960s, anti-communist Ezra Taft Benson claimed Khrushchev said these things during his 1959 visit to the United States. Benson recounted his exchange with Khrushchev in a speech he delivered in 1966:\u00a0\n\"I have talked face-to-face with the godless Communist leaders. It may surprise you to learn that I was host to Mr. Khrushchev for a half day, when he visited the United States. ...\n\"As we talked face-to-face, he indicated that my grandchildren would live under Communism. After assuring him that I expected to do all in my power to assure that his, and all other grandchildren, would live under freedom, he arrogantly declared, in substance:\n\"\u2018You Americans are so gullible. No you won\u2019t accept communism outright, but we\u2019ll keep feeding you small doses of socialism until you\u2019ll finally wake up and you find you already have communism. We won\u2019t have to fight you. We\u2019ll so weaken your economy until you fall like over-ripe fruit into our hands.\u2019\"\nBut Benson\u2019s account has been questioned because he also attributed those words to Khrushchev in a book he wrote in 1962. In that instance, Benson wrote that the Soviet leader made the statement months before his trip to the U.S., and Benson did not claim Khrushchev said them to him one-on-one.\u00a0\nIn terms of what Khrushchev said publicly, the Soviet leader\u2019s 1959 speeches in the U.S. were documented by news outlets and others. The book \"Khrushchev in America\" compiled Khrushchev\u2019s speeches during the 1959 trip, and the full text is searchable online.\nBut when PolitiFact reviewed the speeches and searched for key phrases \u2014 including \"doses of socialism\" and \"Americans are so gullible\" \u2014 we did not find any indication that Khrushchev said the things attributed to him in the Facebook post.\nOur ruling\nOn Facebook, Haley quoted Khrushchev as saying, \"Your children's children will live under communism. You Americans are so gullible. No, you won't accept communism outright; but, we will keep feeding you small doses of socialism until you will finally wake up and find you already have Communism.\"\nApart from one anecdotal claim from an individual whose story was inconsistent, there is no evidence Khrushchev said any variation of this quote.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18655"}
