While the headline is wrong, it is based on an actual ruling by a judge. We sent a message to the website but did not get a reply.\nThe article linked to a Nov. 29 article in the Washington Post about a federal judge\u2019s ruling in a lawsuit brought by two Democratic attorneys general against Trump. The lawsuit alleges that Trump violated anti-corruption clauses in the Constitution because he benefits financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties.\nThe emoluments clause of the Constitution says that no officer of the United States can accept gifts, titles or emoluments (salary) from a foreign government, without permission from Congress.\nOn Nov. 28, U.S. District Court Judge Peter J. Messitte ruled that that D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can serve subpoenas requiring Trump-owned companies to preserve documents.\nThe Post described the decision as \"a small advancement\" in the case.\nWe read Messitte\u2019s two-paragraph decision and saw nothing that addressed Trump himself being subpoenaed. Here is the main part:\n\"It is hereby ordered that the parties shall be permitted to serve subpoenas on third-parties for the sole purpose of preservation of documents,\" the judge wrote.\nWe asked a spokeswoman for the Maryland attorney general if the ruling stated that the plaintiffs could subpoena Trump.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No, it only relates to preservation of documents,\" Raquel Coombs said.\nRobert Marus, a spokesman for the D.C. Attorney General, told PolitiFact that the ruling allows the plaintiffs to serve document preservation subpoenas on the Trump-owned companies in preparation for moving to the discovery phase of the lawsuit against President Trump.\n\"Those entities are not parties to this litigation, which means they would not normally be required to preserve documents. However, their records may be relevant to the case, which is why we asked the court for special permission to subpoena them to preserve these documents,\" Marus wrote.\nParties to litigation -- in this case Trump in his official capacity -- do not have to be subpoenaed to preserve documents, Marus said.\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department pointed to a court document filed on behalf of Trump in which the defendant argued that while a motion to dismiss is pending there shouldn\u2019t be any discovery.\nFor the record, a sitting president can be subpoenaed, said Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky.\n\"Richard Nixon had documents subpoenaed, and the Supreme Court upheld this,\" he told PolitiFact.\nA headline stated that a \"federal judge grants permission to subpoena Trump.\" A federal judge made a ruling about the preservation of documents in a case, but the subpoenas pertain to third-parties, not Trump individually.\nWe rate this headline False.\n Share the Facts 2017-12-05 17:07:59 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Breaking: federal judge grants permission to subpoena Trump.\"    news.groopspeak.com Bloggers https://news.groopspeak.com/breaking-federal-judge-grants-permission-to-subpoena-trump/   in a headline Wednesday, November 29, 2017 2017-11-29    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02630"}
