Steve Bullock, a Democratic candidate for the Senate, \"failed to act\" after one of his aides was fired for sexual harassment.\u00a0\n\"We know Steve Bullock used his position to help his friends and family make money. But there\u2019s a darker side,\" a narrator says. \"Bullock\u2019s most senior political aide was caught sexually harassing women. Bullock knew about the harassment but said nothing, remaining silent when the aide took another job where he harassed women again. Steve Bullock covered for his friend at the expense of these women. Think about that.\"\u00a0\nAs the narrator speaks, the words \"failed to act\" flash on the screen.\nBullock is running against first-term incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines in a toss-up race viewed as critical to determining whether Democrats or Republicans control the Senate. The Montana Senate race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.\u00a0\nThe first claim of the ad, that Steve Bullock used his position to help his friends and family make money, was featured more prominently in another NRSC ad. Other fact-checking organizations have looked closely at the nepotism allegations against Bullock and found them false and baseless.\u00a0\nHowever, the majority of the ad is devoted to a claim that the NRSC hasn\u2019t made before: that Bullock said nothing after his most senior political aide was caught sexually harassing women.\u00a0\nThe NRSC\u2019s claims revolve around Kevin O\u2019Brien, a former aide to Bullock and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. O\u2019Brien was fired from two organizations for sexual harassment: the Democratic Governors Association, which Bullock chaired, and the New York City mayor\u2019s office.\u00a0\nHowever, the 30-second NRSC ad leaves out some important context. Here, we\u2019ll break down the controversy over Bullock\u2019s handling of Kevin O\u2019Brien in detail and determine whether the claims in the NRSC\u2019s attack ad are accurate.\u00a0\nThe controversy over Kevin O\u2019Brien\u00a0\nO\u2019Brien first went to work for Bullock, then Montana attorney general, in 2009. O\u2019Brien served as campaign manager for Bullock\u2019s gubernatorial campaign in 2012 and became deputy chief of staff to the governor in 2013.\u00a0\nIn 2015, Bullock served a one-year term as chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, a political group that supports Democratic governors and candidates in their election campaigns. That year, O\u2019Brien left the employ of the governor\u2019s office and started work as a senior adviser for the Democratic Governors Association, serving as Bullock\u2019s representative.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen months into his new job, O\u2019Brien was accused of sexually harassing another employee at an after-work event. An internal investigation substantiated the employee\u2019s allegations, and O\u2019Brien was fired with Bullock\u2019s approval. Bullock told the Billings Gazette that he made the decision to terminate O\u2019Brien the moment he became aware of the allegations. In a statement to the New York Times, Bullock said that he \"fully agreed with the decision\" to fire O\u2019Brien.\nA month after his termination, O\u2019Brien secured a job as chief of staff in the New York City mayor\u2019s office. A press secretary for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told the New York Times that the city\u2019s Department of Investigation at the time conducted a background check on O\u2019Brien that included contacting both the Democratic Governors Association and the Montana Department of Administration, which handles personnel matters for the state. According to the press secretary, neither the governors association nor the state of Montana offered any \"adverse information\" about O\u2019Brien\u2019s employment history.\u00a0\nAmber Conger, director of communications for the Montana Department of Administration, told PolitiFact that the human resources division subjected O\u2019Brien to an \"employment verification check\" when New York\u2019s Department of Investigation called, providing basic information about his tenure at the Governor\u2019s office, like the dates he was employed and his title.\u00a0\n\"No staff at (the Department of Administration) HR division had any knowledge of harassment issues involving Kevin O\u2019Brien while he was employed by the state, or by any other employer,\" she wrote in an email.\u00a0\nBullock has claimed that he didn\u2019t know that O\u2019Brien had applied for a job at the mayor\u2019s office until after he was hired. In October 2017, almost two years after O\u2019Brien was hired in de Blasio\u2019s office, Bullock met with both de Blasio and O\u2019Brien at Gracie Mansion, according to the New York Times\u2019 review of de Blasio\u2019s schedule. But Bullock said later he didn\u2019t tell the mayor why O\u2019Brien had been terminated.\u00a0\nO\u2019Brien was forced to resign from his position at the mayor\u2019s office less than six months later when an internal investigation found that he had sexually harassed two city employees. A year later, the New York Times published several stories on his ouster after it obtained documents of the investigation.\u00a0\nDe Blasio criticized Bullock and the Democratic Governors Association, saying that he found it \"personally frustrating\" that neither had told his office about the previous harassment allegations.\u00a0\nIn Feb. 2019 after the New York Times broke the story about O\u2019Brien\u2019s firing from the mayor\u2019s office, Bullock apologized to Montanans in a Medium post. \"Should I have called Mayor de Blasio? Should I have let more people know? Was I na\u00efve to think this wouldn\u2019t happen again? The answer is yes,\" he wrote. \"I was wrong and naive to think I did enough. I should have done more to ensure future employers would learn of his behavior.\"\nOur ruling\nA campaign ad says Bullock \"failed to act\" when his \"most senior political aide was caught sexually harassing women. Bullock knew about the harassment but said nothing, remaining silent when the aide took another job where he harassed women again.\"\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not accurate that Bullock didn\u2019t act. O\u2019Brien was working for the Democratic Governor\u2019s Association when allegations of sexual harassment surfaced, ultimately leading to O\u2019Brien\u2019s termination. Bullock, who was chair of the association at the time, says that when he became aware of the allegations, he decided it was appropriate to terminate O\u2019Brien.\nHowever, Bullock has conceded that he didn\u2019t tell Bill de Blasio about the reasons for O\u2019Brien\u2019s termination when he became aware that the NYC mayor\u2019s office had hired him. O\u2019Brien was subsequently fired again for harassing two additional women.\u00a0\nThe claim is partially accurate but leaves out some important details.
