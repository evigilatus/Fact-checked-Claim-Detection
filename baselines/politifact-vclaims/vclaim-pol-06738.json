Jeb Bush\u2019s talking points as he explores a presidential bid is to call for giving every child access to a great public education, regardless of where they live. Bush has talked for years about the gains of minority students in Florida.\n\"Florida\u2019s Hispanic kids are the best of any Hispanic group of Hispanic students in the United States -- in fact, two grade levels ahead of the average in the United States,\" Bush said during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club on Feb. 4\nWe decided to fact-check if Hispanic students in Florida perform \"the best\" of any Hispanic population in the United States. Let\u2019s hit the books.\nFlorida\u2019s Hispanic students\nA spokeswoman for Bush told PolitiFact that Bush was referring to fourth grade reading scores from The National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP.\nMany educational experts consider the annual NAEP, dubbed \"the nation\u2019s report card,\" to be the best state-by-state measure of education systems. Sponsored by the U.S. Education Department, the exam is given to a sample of fourth, eighth and 12th grade students every two years in reading and math.\nFor 2013, the NAEP showed that Florida\u2019s Hispanic fourth-graders ranked the first state in the nation for highest average reading score. (The Education Department considers Florida\u2019s score statistically tied with a handful of other states.) So Bush chose a statistic that puts Florida\u2019s Hispanic students in the most favorable light.\nWhile Bush can point to the NAEP reading results for fourth graders and argue Florida\u2019s students are \"the best,\" that title doesn\u2019t hold up on all NAEP measurements. For example, Florida\u2019s Hispanic fourth graders were fourth among states for math, and eighth graders ranked lower in both reading and math.\nIs there a valid reason for Bush to zero in on fourth-grade reading?\n\"Reading scores in fourth grade are widely considered to be an important metric because early literacy has been linked to subsequent educational outcomes,\" said Sterling C. Lloyd, senior research associate at Education Week Research Center. \"For instance, according to research studies, students who are struggling to read in third grade are at greater risk of dropping out of high school. It\u2019s thought of as an early warning sign predicting risk of dropping out.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s helpful to consider NAEP scores in other grades and subjects, as well as high school graduation rates, to \"provide a more comprehensive view of educational results than a single metric,\" Lloyd said.\nFor example, with respect to eighth grade NAEP reading, Florida\u2019s scores for Hispanic students were 12th nationally (out of 46 states and D.C.). For eighth grade math, Florida ranked 20th.\nAnother expert took issue with the definition of \"Hispanic.\" Richard Rothstein, an education research associate at the Economic Policy Institute, previously told us that it\u2019s a meaningless category for educational purposes.\n\"Florida\u2019s \u2018Hispanics\u2019 are not comparable to \u2018Hispanics\u2019 in other states because Florida\u2019s include a larger proportion of middle-class Cubans, and a smaller proportion of lower-class Mexicans. Without knowing anything else, you would expect middle-class Cubans to perform at a higher level than lower-class Mexicans, because of the literacy levels at home, if for no other reason.\"\nUniversity of Iowa Professor David Bills said we would need to know more about the family background of Hispanics in different states to reach any conclusions about why Florida outperforms other states.\n\"If there is anything we know for certain about test scores, it\u2019s that the effects of families trump the effects of schools,\" he said. \u00a0\"My guess is that they\u2019re more likely to have well-educated parents than are Hispanic kids from California or Wisconsin, which score much lower. I think in a properly conducted study, we would learn that Florida\u2019s fourth grade Hispanics do pretty well more because they come from social backgrounds that facilitate their doing well, and less because of things happening inside schools.\"\nOur ruling\nBush said, \"Florida\u2019s Hispanic kids are the best of any Hispanic group of Hispanics students in the United States.\"\nBush\u2019s statement was too broad and he didn\u2019t explain what measurement he used to reach that conclusion -- which was fourth grade reading scores. On NAEP, a respected source of testing data, Florida\u2019s Hispanic fourth graders ranked statistically tied for first among states in 2013.\nBut that's not the case for fourth grade math. Nor does the trend continue when looking at eighth grade test scores.\u00a0\nBush's claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06738"}
