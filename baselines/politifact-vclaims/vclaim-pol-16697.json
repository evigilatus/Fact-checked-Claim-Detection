In June 2019, Facebook revoked an Adams\u2019 page promoting alternative medicine for violating spam rules. The page, called NaturalNews, reportedly had 2.9 million Facebook likes.\nAdam\u2019s recent post on Virginia centers on a bill recently introduced by state Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, that would add restrictions to Virginia\u2019s paramilitary activities laws. Passed in 1987, the laws make it a felony to assemble - or teach how to assemble - guns, explosives or incendiary devices with the intention of abetting civil disorder. Violators face a maximum 10 years in prison and $2,500 fine.\nLucas\u2019 bill would also make it a felony for people to gather \"with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons by drilling, parading, or marching with any firearm, any explosive or incendiary device, or any components or combination thereof.\" It comes after the August 2017 white supremicist rally in Charlottesville\u00a0that left one counterprotestor dead and others injured.\u00a0\nAdams wrote that the bill, in addition to banning a father from teaching his son how to hunt with a rifle, \"would also criminalize all firearms training classes, including concealed carry classes.\"\nHe added, \"The law would instantly transform all martial arts instructors into criminal felons.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nIn fact, the legislation would do none of these things.\nLucas\u2019 bill, as we noted, adds to the list of illegal acts and Virginia\u2019s paramilitary laws. But it leaves intact the next section of the code, which\u00a0which exempts from paramilitary laws:\n\n\n*\"Any activity, undertaken without knowledge of or intent to cause or further a civil disorder, which is intended to teach or practice self defense or self-defense techniques such as karate clubs...\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\"Lawful activities related to firearms instruction or\u00a0training intended to teach the safe handling and use of firearms.\"\u00a0\n\n\n*\"Lawful sports or activities related to the individual recreational use or possession of firearms.\"\n\n\nWe tried to contact Adams, but received no reply to three emails sent to an address on one of his websites for media inquiries. A person answereing the phone in Adams' media relations office, who didn\u2019t give her name, told us \"there probably won\u2019t be a response.\"\nIt should be noted that Lucas introduced identical bills in each of the last two years that were killed in Republican-controlled Senate committees. GOP senators voiced concern that the bill would be hard to enforce and might violate citizens\u2019 constitutional right to assemble. Videos of the hearings show no one raising concerns that the bill would affect firearms training or self-defense instruction.\nThe bill may face better prospects this year, with Democrats controlling both chambers of the General Assembly for the first time this century. Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, has endorsed the legislation.\nOur ruling\nAdams wrote that a bill in the General Assembly \"would criminalize a father teaching his own son how to use a hunting rifle.\"\nThat\u2019s flat out wrong. The bill would add a clause to the state\u2019s paramilitary laws making it a felony for groups to train or march with weapons with \"the intent of intimidating others.\" The bill, however, does not change a code section that exempts from the paramilitary act \"lawful activities related to firearms instruction.\"\nAnother ridiculous Adams\u2019 claim: The bill \"would instantly transform all martial arts instructors into criminal felons.\" State paramilitary laws specifically exempt common efforts to\u00a0 \"teach or practice self defense or self-defense techniques such as karate clubs.\"\nAdam\u2019s claims are devoid of truth and inflammatory. We rate them \"Pants on Fire.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16697"}
