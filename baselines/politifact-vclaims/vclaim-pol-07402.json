Who\u2019s committing the murder? Not police. Other black men.\"\nLast year, PolitiFact found that 93 percent of murder victims were killed by someone who shares their race. This time, we want to check out Williams\u2019 claim that homicide is the No. 1 cause of death for black men 15-34 years old.\nUnnatural causes \nWe looked at numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which lists the leading causes of death across all demographics.\nExperts said that CDC data, compiled from coroner reports, are in line with FBI numbers, sourced from police reports. The CDC does not distinguish between the types of homicide (criminal, justified, etc.) or the types of accidents (auto accidents, falls, firearm discharge, etc.). The numbers for 2011, the most recent CDC findings, are consistent with data from previous years.\nAccording to the CDC, homicide was indeed the No. 1 killer of black men between the ages of 15 and 34 in 2011. Accidents ranked second in causes of death, and suicide claimed the third amount of black male lives between 15 and 24 years old, while heart disease ranked third for men 24-34.\nLeading causes of death among black males\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n1st\n\n\n2nd\n\n\n3rd\n\n\n\n\nAll ages\n\n\nDiseases of the heart\n\n\nMalignant neoplasms\n\n\nAccidents\n\n\n\n\n1-4\n\n\nAccidents\n\n\nHomicide\n\n\nCongenital malformations\n\n\n\n\n5-14\n\n\nAccidents\n\n\nMalignant neoplasms\n\n\nHomicide\n\n\n\n\n15-24\n\n\nHomicide\n\n\nAccidents\n\n\nSuicide\n\n\n\n\n25-34\n\n\nHomicide\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidents\n\n\nDiseases of the heart\n\n\n\n\n35-44\n\n\nDiseases of the heart\n\n\nAccidents\n\n\nHomicide\n\n\n\n\n45-54\n\n\nDiseases of the heart\n\n\nMalignant neoplasms\n\n\nAccidents\n\n\n\n\n55-84\n\n\nMalignant neoplasms\n\n\nDiseases of the heart\n\n\nCerebrovascular diseases\n\n\n\n\n84-older\n\n\nDiseases of the heart\n\n\nMalignant neoplasms\n\n\nCerebrovascular diseases\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: CDC\nCompared\u00a0to other ethnicities, the numbers really stand out. Forty percent of African-American males\u00a015-34 who died were murdered, according to the CDC, compared to just 3.8 percent of white males\u00a0who died. Overall, 14 percent of all men 15-34 who died in 2011 were murdered.\nIn 2011, black males 15-34 were 10 times more likely to die of murder than whites of the same age group.\n\nSources: CDC, PunditFact calculations\nFor men of all ages, homicide was ranked fifth in leading causes of deaths for blacks (4.6 percent), seventh for Hispanics (2.8 percent), and ninth for American Indians (2.3 percent). Homicide was not one of the top 15 causes of death for whites 15-34.\nColor lines \nWhy are so many young black males dying from homicide?\nAs the laws of aging go, younger men are less prone to fall victim to natural causes of death, so they are more likely to die of unnatural causes. And the racial disparity between those causes has partially to do with the likelihood of getting into car-related accidents, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University.\n\"Suburban whites drive more than urban blacks, and putting in more miles on highways \u2014 \u00a0that\u2019s important because not a lot of people are going to get killed in fender benders in neighborhood streets,\" Fox said. \"There are relatively few auto-accidents in black urban areas.\"\nBeyond driving habits, the criminal homicide rate among young black males is significantly higher than other groups. This, experts agreed, has to do with poverty and geography.\nThe difference in social structures, access to jobs, educational opportunities, and many other factors between impoverished black neighborhoods and others is often a matter of life and death, according to Eli Silverman, professor emeritus at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \u00a0\n\"The (homicide) numbers highlight the condition in minority areas, where a lot of violence occurs and the whole way of life is further intensified because police surveillance is always trying to track down people,\" he said. \"People have heightened survival instincts, will do anything to survive, and they\u2019ll seek retribution for anything...because they don\u2019t trust law enforcement.\"\nThough it is tempting to pinpoint one cause as more impactful than others, Silverman cautions against singling out poverty or drugs or any other factor as the cause, because all of them intermix and interact.\nOur ruling\nWilliams said that the No. 1 cause of death for black men 15-34 years old is murder.\nCDC data supports the claim. Out of all causes of death, homicide claimed about 40 percent of black lives between 15 and 34 years. This was significantly higher than the national average for males of that age group, and all other racial groups.\nWe rate Williams' claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07402"}
