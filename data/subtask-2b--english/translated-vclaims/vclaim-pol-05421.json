He called him disappointed.", "truth_label": "half-true", "date": "stated on February 11, 2016 in comments during the PBS Democratic debate:", "title": "Did Bernie Sanders call President Barack Obama weak and disappointed?", "text": "In one of the hottest exchanges in the democratic presidential debate in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton accused Bernie Sanders of showing little loyalty to President Barack Obama. Clinton said, \"In the past, Saunders called Obama weak. \"He called him disappointed.\" To confirm, I later reiterated the charge that Sanders had used the word \"vulnerable\" and \"disappointment.\" But did he? We found many examples of Saunders urging Obama to take a more rigorous approach to sentencing, and we have previously found some truth in the charge that Saunders tried to find someone to challenge Obama in the first instance when he was running for a second term in 2012. But the specific charge that Clinton made -- which Sanders used for the words \"weak\" and \"disappointment\" -- was at best exaggerated. We found two examples when Sanders used one or both words, both more terrifying than Clinton would allow. The first was an interview by Saunders with Tom Hartman on July 22, 2011. Sanders regretted that Obama, in his view, had come a long way to the political right. But while Sanders used the words that Clinton cited, he didn't say he himself felt that way. Specifically, Sanders said, \"I believe that there are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the President, who believe that with regard to social security and a number of other issues, he has said one thing as a candidate, and he is doing something very else as a president, who cannot believe how weak he is - for whatever reason - in negotiating with the Republicans. There is deep disappointment.\" Note Sanders: He says \"millions of Americans\" feel that way, not that he did it himself. It's a small difference, but we think it's an important difference given the strength of Clinton's line of attack. Another example we found was November 13, 2011, when Pol\u00edtico stated that Sanders would not say whether he would support Obama's re-election (although he eventually did). The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, the Pol\u00edtico article from Sanders quoted that Obama should \"stop reaching negotiated agreements with the Republicans that are too weak and unfavourable to ordinary people. .................................................................................... I certainly hope and expect to support the President, but it's a little early in this process.\" Here, Sanders said that Obama reached weak agreements with his political opponents, not that Obama himself was personally weak. Again, this is more accurate than Clinton's assertion that it will be. We should note that Sanders used other words to move away from Obama's policies and approaches to governance. For example, in July 2015, Sanders told Jim Tankersley, a writer for the Washington Post, \"In many ways, the President was not strong enough in many cases. For example, he's wrong in the trade case, totally wrong. Also, the President made a mistake, because after his brilliant campaign in 2008, he basically said to his most enthusiastic supporters, thank you very much for electing me, but I'm going out here alone. I'm gonna sit down and negotiate with Bohner and Mitch McConnell, and I really don't need you anymore. Terrible mistake. Because the only way forward, to put forward a progressive agenda, is to mobilize the American people.\" This is certainly a critical assessment of the state of Obama, but it does not include the word \"vulnerable\" or the word \"disappointment.\" Our referee, Clinton, said Saunders called Obama weak. He called him disappointed. Saunders Obama has criticized and used these words to describe the feelings of Americans, or to describe Obama's policies. But Saunders didn't specifically call Obama \"weak\" and \"disappointment.\" We value the claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05421"}
