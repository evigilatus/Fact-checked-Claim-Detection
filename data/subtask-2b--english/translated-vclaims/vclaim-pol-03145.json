Since the risks of watching television seem high in the mind of the president, we decided to look more closely at CNN's direction. The result: Trump is quite wrong with Tramp's claim that CNN's low estimates raise the question: compared to what? Because his tweet did not mention any other cable news networks, we assume that Trump compares the current CNN classifications with previous ones. The television experts with whom we talked about how to measure the CNN track suggested that we compare CNN figures from year to year, based on data from the second quarter (in 2017, the estimates for the second quarter of March 27 to June 25). To get a comprehensive view, we were told to consider classifications through several benchmarks, broken down by demographic characteristics of the public and observed times. In summary: CNN is five years in each of the categories we have considered, according to data provided by Nielsen. CNN Ratings Primetime, Caltal Vieners Primetime, 25-54 Talmal Day, Talume, 25-54 Q2 1,055, 371,000 788,000 263, 2016Q2 Q2 Q2 Brugers on 13 January 2021 in a story that says General David H. Berger, Commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Pelosi's request for the use of Marines to launch security, and said, \"We are not working for you.\" On 17 January 2021, 929, 312, 627,000, 188,000, 2015 Q2 560, 190, 430,000, 13000 2014 Q2 459, 15000, 341,000, 105, 2013 Q2 666000 228,475,000 161,000, so when it comes to comparing current CNN classifications to past estimates, the verdict is clear: they have moved to many major categories compared to recent years. For its part, CNN launched the second quarter numbers \"a milestone,\" with the cable news network recording a record number of total viewers, and the second quarter best since 2003 in terms of total day viewers between the ages of 25 and 54. \"CNN just published the second-most sighted quarter of history,\" from the CNN Public Relations account on Twitter in response to Trump. \"These are the facts.\" The CNN has just published that the second quarter of history is the most visible. These are the facts.--CIF Communications (@CNNPR) 27 June 2017 ruled Trump said CNN classifications are \"low.\" In fact, CNN is five years of rise in many major categories, according to data provided by Nelson. We appreciate Trump's statement of fire pants.
