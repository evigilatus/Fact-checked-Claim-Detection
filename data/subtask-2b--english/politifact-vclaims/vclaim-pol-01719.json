Baldwin's statement on Trump stance on transgender people in the military", "text": "Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay person to the serve in the Senate, has been a champion of LGBTQ rights. \u00a0\u00a0\nAt a June 2018 Human Rights Campaign event, Baldwin gave a speech in which she praised volunteers on the front lines of the \"fight for equality\" and also aimed a couple barbs at the Donald Trump administration.\nOn August 17, 2018, PolitiFact Wisconsin did a fact check on the first barb:\nThe Trump administration \"has banned the CDC even using the word \u2018transgender,\u2019\" Baldwin told the crowd, which booed in response.\nThe statement was based on a Washington Post report. But that story was later countered by several other published reports that indicated the words were not banned. Rather, it was suggested that other words be used in some cases \u2014 in part to temper controversy during the budget process.\nWe rated the claim False. See that claim here.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, PolitiFact Wisconsin turns its attention to the second part of Baldwin\u2019s claim:\n\"President Trump continues to disrespect patriotic transgender Americans who want to serve their country.\"\nEvidence\nWhen asked to back up Baldwin\u2019s claim, campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to news reports of nationwide demonstrations that erupted following the proposed transgender ban.\n\u00a0\nBackground\nTrump, citing concern over military focus and medical costs, announced on Twitter in June 2017 that he would ban transgender individuals from serving \"in any capacity\" in the U.S. military.\nThe president tweeted the following:\nAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.

Lambda Legal is a nonprofit legal organization:\n\"Lambda Legal is the oldest and largest national legal organization whose mission is to achieve full recognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and everyone living with HIV through impact litigation, education and public policy work,\" according to its mission statement.\n\u00a0\nOur rating\nTammy Baldwin told a Human Rights group that \"President Trump continues to disrespect patriotic transgender Americans who want to serve their country.\"\nThere are ample reports that the administration is continuing its attempts to bar transgender individuals from the military, including updating and adjusting its policy as court rulings roll in. Having said that, it\u2019s important to note that the issue is still winding its way through the courts, so a ban is not in place at this time.
