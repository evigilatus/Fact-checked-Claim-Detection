Were Christine Ford\u2019s unbelievable accusations rooted in her incessant need for attention all along?\" said the Virginia Press story.\nThe story accurately quotes Russell Ford\u2019s comments to the Washington Post about his wife not getting the attention or respect she felt she deserved.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Virginia Press site misrepresents what he said to paint it in a negative light. Russell Ford did not make those comments in efforts to expose a \"sick issue.\" That\u2019s a conclusion the website makes. Russell Ford\u2019s comments in the Washington Post story are in the context of how they met and built a relationship. Christine Blasey Ford grew up on the east coast and now lives in California, where she is a professor.\n\"She didn\u2019t always get along with her parents because of differing political views,\" Russell Ford told the Washington Post. \"It was a very male-dominated environment. Everyone was interested in what\u2019s going on with the men, and the women are sidelined, and she didn\u2019t get the attention or respect she felt she deserved. That\u2019s why she was in California, to get away from the D.C. scene.\"\nThe post also claims that Christine Blasey Ford has been berated by online student reviews. Bloggers made those claims based on reviews for another professor.\nThe Virginia Press website features several elements associated with websites promoting false information.
