This article, published in September 8, presents three images of sharks and fish showing tumours or skin injuries. Massive cancer tumors were found on their bodies. The salmon arrested off the coast of Alaska is full of cancer, \"Reads the article. Fukushima has been radioactively leaking into our oceans every day since 2011, and the oceans are very sick because of this. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We've shared it about 2,000 times, so we wanted to check it out. The Fukushima nuclear disaster following the tsunami struck the eastern coast of Japan in 2011, killing more than 18,000 people. The accident occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant between Tokyo and Sendai and resulted in the collapse of three reactors. It was the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. While sharks and fish are able to get cancer tumors, the images in the mail are misleading. Neither of them was directly related to Fukushima, and there was little evidence to suggest that the fish from Japan had been affected by the disaster. The images don't prove the nuclear connection. We did reverse the search for the images for each of the photos listed in Facebook. The first picture, which shows sharks with what appears to be tumors around their mouth, dates back at least to 2013. At that time, a website called Live Science was published as part of a story about the cause of cancer among sharks. \"It is unknown what caused the tumors in the great white or bronze shark,\" wrote Live Science from the picture. However, reports of cancer tumours in marine animals, especially mammals, have increased steadily over the past 20 years, raising concerns that industrial pollutants or human activities may cause cancer. The story - based on a 2013 study - does not refer specifically to Fukushima or to wider nuclear disasters as having an impact. The second picture, showing a fish with skin damage, is at least seven years old. We found it in a story published by ZME Science in November 2012, which covered how Canadian researchers found pollutants near oil sand operations. The third picture in Facebook is slightly more vague. The island &apos; s 2012 story about the 2010 blood pressure oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has emerged. She stated that the picture showed shrimp with mutations as a result of the spill. None of the stories mention that nuclear radiation activity has contributed to these pests. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he adhere to the proven book of democratic play.\" By Sira O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021, there was little risk of contaminated fish outside Japan. But does it have a bigger point about Fukushima's influence on fish? In general, no, but the answer is a little more complicated. The article specifically mentions salmon off the coast of Alaska as \"filled with cancer.\" However, a public statement by the State Department of Conservation of the Environment refutes the argument that the results of the tests did not indicate measurable levels of radionuclides related to Fukushima - radioactive atoms - in Alaska's seafood. \" (Food and Drug Administration) has found no evidence that the radionuclides of health importance from the disaster at the Japanese nuclear power plant are present in the United States food supply,\" states the statement. Some scientists have found salmon in small quantities of cesium 134, a radioactive element specifically associated with the Fukushima disaster in Canadian waters. However, the levels were 10,000 times lower than the health safety guidelines. With regard to the Great Barrier Reef, another area specifically mentioned in the article, the link between Fukushima and fish is equally weak. In a public statement published by the Australian Agency for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety, officials said that they had not detected any significant radioactivity off the coast. \"There are ongoing monitoring programmes that continue to monitor the Fukushima signature, but it is expected that the radioactive material has been reduced to low levels that cannot be detected.\" In this picture, on August 26, 2013, the Fumio Suzuki hunter was caught in the waters off Iwaki, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) south of the Fukushima Dai-chi nuclear power plant, Japan. Japan is a different story. A 2012 study found high cesium levels in fish directly off the coast of Fukushima, and the Government banned the sale of certain species of marine life exceeding 100 pg/kg. These bans stopped slowly until February of this year, when officials observed a rise in contaminated cesium off the coast of Fukushima. However, since the disaster, the Government has made considerable efforts to decontaminate, maintaining the safety of most fish and agriculture in the country. None of this means that radioactive contamination of marine life outside Japan is impossible. Scientists and correspondents studying the long-term effects of Fukushima warn that radiation will continue to leak to the Pacific for years to come. But so far, these effects are often measurable in the waters near the coast of the disaster site and even there, most fish are safe to eat. Our Facebook article claimed that many species of marine life near Alaska, Canada and Australia were found with cancer, mutations and radiation as a result of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. None of the images in the article were linked to the radiation caused by the disaster, or even to Japan in general. Studies show that sharks and other marine life are able to obtain tumours and cancer pests, albeit not exclusively due to radiation. Although scientists have found high levels of radioactive elements in fish off the coast of Fukushima, most marine life is safe for consumption and officials in the United States and Australia have not found similar radiation. The Facebook article contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00169"}
