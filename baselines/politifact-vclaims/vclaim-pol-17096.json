Kamala Harris is the first Asian American and the first Black woman to be on a major-party ticket. But misinformation questioning the ancestry of the Democratic vice presidential pick has already begun to spread on Facebook.\u00a0\nOne photo we saw on Facebook shows Harris posing with two people at a gala \u2014 a woman in a sari and a man in a suit. A caption above the photo reads: \"These are Kamala Harris\u2019s parents. Her dad is Jamaican. Her mom is Indian. So why does she refer to herself as an \u2018African American?\u2019\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis photo does not show Harris with her parents. The people in the picture are California residents Suneil and Rohini Parulekar, who are unrelated to Harris.\u00a0\nThe Parulekars confirmed that they were the couple in the photograph in an interview with PolitiFact. Suneil Parulekar laughed when presented with the image.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are not Kamala Harris\u2019s parents,\" he said. \"But unfortunately we live in an era of misinformation.\"\nParulekar said that the photo was taken four years ago when Harris was California attorney general. She was a guest of honor at a gala held by the nonprofit organization Pratham, of which the Parulekars are board members.\u00a0\nThe text is correct in stating that Harris\u2019s father is Jamaican and her mother is Indian. However, it also wrongly implies that Harris cannot have African ancestry because \"her dad is Jamaican.\" According to a 2011 census, 92.1 percent of Jamaicans are Black, with genetic studies showing that the vast majority hail from sub-Saharan Africa.\u00a0\nHarris\u2019s father Donald J. Harris is a former Stanford economics professor. Her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, died of cancer in 2009, seven years before the picture at the gala was taken.\u00a0\nThis post does not show Harris\u2019s parents.
