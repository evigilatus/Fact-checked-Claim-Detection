Clanton \"Keep 20% of the U.S. supply of uranium to Russia-- to Russia,\" said Trump September 28, 2016, two days after their first discussion. \"You know what people do with uranium, don't you? It's called nuclear. Twenty percent. They wouldn't have done it without her. This is a tighter version and less incited than a previous Trump attack. But he still has problems. The Uranium deal before we go too far on ourselves -- the U.S. gave its five uranium to Russia? What? Uranium is used to operate commercial nuclear reactors that produce electricity and isotopes used for medical, industrial and defence purposes worldwide. With regard to the deal referred to by Tramp, it included the Russian Nuclear Agency and uranium 1, a company based in Toronto. As reported by the National Polite Fact, the Russian Nuclear Energy Agency, which also builds nuclear weapons, purchased a control stake in U1. The company has mines, mills and land areas in Wyoming, Utah and the other United States equivalent to about 20 per cent of the United States uranium production capacity. So, to be clear, 20% is the power, not the uranium that was produced. Since Russia does not have licences to export uranium outside the United States, it is likely to be more interested in the assets of the first uranium in Kazakhstan, the world &apos; s largest uranium producer, as our colleagues have said. As reported by The New York Times, the transaction took place in separate transactions from 2009 to 2013. The Russian Atomic Energy Agency has made it one of the largest producers of uranium in the world, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has made \"near to his goal of controlling a large part of the global uranium supply chain.\" So, what was Clinton's role? Since uranium is a strategic asset with implications for national security, the agreement had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives of a number of United States government agencies. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 at the time, the United States was seeking to \"restore\" relations with Russia and try to get the Kremlin on board Iran's nuclear deal. The issue of national security raised in the U1 deal was not primarily related to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, as reported by The Times, because for years the United States and Russia have cooperated on that front, with Russia sending enriched warheads withdrawn from service for use in United States nuclear power plants in exchange for uranium. Instead, it is about American dependence on foreign uranium sources. While the United States receives one fifth of its electric power from nuclear plants, it produces only about 20 per cent of the uranium it needs. The Tramp claims now, we go back to what Trump said. The previous Trump claim on this subject, made in June 2016, was that the Clinton State Department \"approved the transfer of 20% of United States holdings of uranium to Russia, while nine investors in the deal transferred $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.\" ===PolicFact===PolicFact National probably misgraded -- basically because there's no evidence of a quid pro quo. In respect of the present Trump claim, it is overstated. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs approved the single uranium deal, but did not act unilaterally. It was one of nine government agencies in the United States, as well as independent state and federal nuclear regulators, which had to sign the deal. As Factcheck.org noted in verifying the relevant facts, while any of the nine agencies could have objected to the transaction, only President Barack Obama had the power to object. Even then, the president can ban such transactions only with \"credible evidence\" that \"a foreign interest exercising control may take action that threatens to undermine national security.\" Our assessment of Trump says that Clinton \"save 20% of the U.S. supply of uranium to Russia.\" The signal here is that the Russian Nuclear Energy Agency buys a controlling stake in a Toronto-based company. This company has mines, mills and land areas in Wyoming, Utah and the other United States equivalent to about 20 per cent of the U.S. uranium production capacity (non-Uranium production). Clinton was then Secretary of State, but she did not have the authority to approve or reject the transaction. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was only one of the nine federal agencies that signed the deal, and Obama only had the authority to reverse it. For a statement that contains only the element of truth, our assessment is often wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cbdc6c17-60c1-4ca0-b4e9-84c4095d12", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04231"}
