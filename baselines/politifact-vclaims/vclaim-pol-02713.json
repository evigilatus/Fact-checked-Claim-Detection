That\u2019s true.\nBut it\u2019s fake news that the Gators said they don\u2019t want to play their traditional post-Thanksgiving rivalry game with Florida State University.\n\"UF requests to cancel rivalry game against FSU,\" read the headline on a post we first saw Nov. 7, 2017, on React365.com. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to curb fake news.\nThe brief article, attributed to \"Patrick Jones - Sports Writer,\" said that the Gators are looking for a little mercy from the Seminoles after a terrible season.\nAs of this writing, the Gators had a 3-5 record. Florida head coach Jim McElwain was fired Oct. 29 after a season fraught with controversy and disappointment. Florida State also had a 3-5 record at the time of the article.\nThe fake story said: \"When asked why they were considering canceling the game, a spokesman for the UF Athletic Department stated, \u2018Though both programs are struggling this year, dealing with injuries and academic disciplinary action, there is no need in embarrassing the UF Athletic program further by subjecting our already mediocre team to a game that would further humiliate the morale and enthusiasm of our student body.\u2019 \"\nThe University of Florida Athletic Association didn\u2019t make any such statement, and the Gators aren\u2019t giving up on their Nov. 25 game at the Swamp. The story is completely made up.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReact365.com is a website that allows people to create \"prank\" stories, in which users write a few sentences and post a photo to trick people.\nThe stories have the same effect as any fake news article \u2014 they trick readers into thinking they are real. Out of context, anyone can be fooled, even with the minimal warning posted at the bottom of the page that reads, \"This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users. These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information.\"\nReact365.com is one of a number of URLs owned by a man named Nicolas Gouriou, who runs a company in Binic, France, called Mediavibes.\nWhen we tried to contact Mediavibes via email, they only replied that they do not comment to the press.\nReaders should be wary of any story from React365.com or similar sites. The posts appear to always carry the current date, and feature a share counter that reflects the current date. When we saw this story, the counter said the story was from Nov. 7 and had been shared more than 94,000 times, but there\u2019s no way to tell if that\u2019s accurate.\nWe contacted UF ourselves, just to make sure this Thanksgiving weekend tradition really was slated to continue as scheduled. \"This is not true,\" athletic association spokesman Will Pantages confirmed.\nFeel free to plan your turkey day recovery around the UF-FSU rivalry game, because this is another fumble from a fake news generator.
