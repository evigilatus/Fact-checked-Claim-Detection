0001	COOPER	And welcome back.
0002	COOPER	Were coming to you tonight from the Riverside Theater in downtown Milwaukee with the 360 townhall.
0003	COOPER	The three remaining Republican candidates campaigning hard with the primary here just a week away.
0004	COOPER	We heard so far from Senator Ted Cruz.
0005	COOPER	Right now the GOP frontrunner, New York businessman Donald Trump.
0006	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0007	TRUMP	Thank you.
0008	COOPER	Hey, how are you doing?
0009	COOPER	Nice to see you.
0010	TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0011	COOPER	Have a seat.
0012	TRUMP	Thank you.
0013	COOPER	So we got a lot of questions from the audience for you on a lot of policy issues.
0014	COOPER	I got to start off with some news of the day topics.
0015	COOPER	Your campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski charged with simple battery for grabbing a reporter by the arm.
0016	COOPER	Will he continue as your campaign manager?
0017	TRUMP	Yes, he will.
0018	TRUMP	I looked at the tape.
0019	TRUMP	I looked  it was my tape.
0020	TRUMP	It was at one of my places.
0021	TRUMP	I have great security and great security cameras.
0022	TRUMP	I gave the tape, and frankly, if you look at that, people have looked at it  in fact, I just left another area of Wisconsin, we had a whole big meeting with a whole group of people, big audience, tremendous audience, and theyre all shaking their heads, give me a break, give me a break.
0023	COOPER	Let me ask you, though
0024	TRUMP	The answer is yes.
0025	TRUMP	And by the way, speaking of something else, I watched Ted Cruz.
0026	TRUMP	His home state is not Florida.
0027	TRUMP	His home state is Texas.
0028	TRUMP	It may be Canada.
0029	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0030	TRUMP	But to the best of my knowledge, its Texas.
0031	TRUMP	So he made that  I was surprised you didnt correct him actually.
0032	COOPER	Let me ask you about Lewandowski.
0033	COOPER	Initially your campaign said this never happened, there was no video of it.
0034	COOPER	You came out and said you thought this person was, perhaps, making it up, this reporter.
0035	COOPER	Lewandowski, himself, tweeted saying, I never met this reporter, I never touched this person now the videotape shows he clearly did touch this person.
0036	COOPER	Whether or not you think it was battery or not
0037	TRUMP	Touch  I dont know what touch means.
0038	TRUMP	I looked
0039	COOPER	Well, he says I never touched this person.
0040	TRUMP	And then she says, oh, look, at my arm.
0041	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0042	COOPER	Did he mislead you at all?
0043	TRUMP	Not at all.
0044	TRUMP	No, not at all.
0045	TRUMP	Look, I didnt know we had all these security cameras all over.
0046	TRUMP	But the time I found out, I said, well, this is really wonderful, this exonerates him totally.
0047	TRUMP	Now
0048	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0049	TRUMP	(inaudible) would have happened (inaudible) went to the ground or something to the effect that she almost went to the ground.
0050	TRUMP	She was in pain.
0051	TRUMP	She went to the ground.
0052	TRUMP	When she found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed.
0053	TRUMP	She didnt talk about it.
0054	COOPER	No, thats not true.
0055	COOPER	She says her story has remained exactly the same.
0056	COOPER	She was knocked a little bit off
0057	TRUMP	Oh really?
0058	TRUMP	Can I read this to you this then?
0059	COOPER	Yes, that she was knocked off balance but she remained standing.
0060	TRUMP	Do you mind if I read this to you?
0061	TRUMP	Do you mind if I read you her statement?
0062	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0063	TRUMP	I mean, give me a break.
0064	TRUMP	You know, the problem is everybody dumps people when theres, like, a sign of political incorrectness.
0065	TRUMP	Im just going to read, if I can find it
0066	COOPER	She said she was almost knocked off balance, but she remained standing.
0067	TRUMP	She said she was almost knocked off balance, right.
0068	TRUMP	Heres what she said.
0069	TRUMP	You want to read it?
0070	TRUMP	Or you want me to do it?
0071	TRUMP	Youre a professional announcer.
0072	TRUMP	Why dont you read it.
0073	TRUMP	The bottom part.
0074	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0075	TRUMP	The bottom.
0076	TRUMP	Now thats an exact quote from her prior to seeing the cameras, and now she says, oh, I better change my story, I guess.
0077	COOPER	This quote says, I was jolted backwards.
0078	COOPER	Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down.
0079	COOPER	I almost knell fell to the ground but was able...
0080	TRUMP	Yanked you down.
0081	TRUMP	Did you see it?
0082	TRUMP	Did she almost fall to the ground, Anderson?
0083	COOPER	 was able to maintain my balance nonetheless.
0084	COOPER	I was shaken.
0085	COOPER	Campaign managers arent supposed to try to forcefully throw reporters to the ground.
0086	COOPER	No, she did not go down on the ground.
0087	TRUMP	Oh no, let me just say  look, before she knows  folks, look, Im a loyal person.
0088	TRUMP	Im going to be loyal to the country.
0089	TRUMP	Im going to be loyal to Wisconsin.
0090	TRUMP	We have to tell it like it is.
0091	TRUMP	It would be so easy for me to terminate this man, ruin his life, ruin his family.
0092	TRUMP	Hes got four beautiful children in New Hampshire, ruin his whole everything, and say youre fired.
0093	TRUMP	Okay?
0094	TRUMP	I fired many people, especially on The Apprentice.
0095	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0096	TRUMP	But look at what she says.
0097	TRUMP	Michelle Fields, who, by the way, is not a baby.
0098	TRUMP	OK?
0099	TRUMP	In her own worlds, exactly.
0100	TRUMP	I was jolted backwards. Well, shes standing there.
0101	TRUMP	Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm. Tightly.
0102	TRUMP	And yanked me down. She wasnt yanked down.
0103	TRUMP	She was  like, she didnt even have any expression.
0104	TRUMP	If somebody in this audience gets whacked, or gets hurt, including me, you get hit a little bit.
0105	TRUMP	You go, ow.
0106	TRUMP	Theres no emotion.
0107	TRUMP	OK, wait a minute.
0108	TRUMP	I almost fell to the ground. I almost fell to the ground she didnt almost fall to the ground.
0109	TRUMP	He got in her way.
0110	TRUMP	And by the way, she was grabbing me!
0111	TRUMP	Am I supposed to press charges against her?
0112	TRUMP	Oh, my arm is hurting.
0113	TRUMP	Anderson, my arm is just killing me.
0114	TRUMP	Its never been the same.
0115	COOPER	Youve suggested you might 
0116	TRUMP	Excuse me, excuse me!
0117	TRUMP	I didnt suggest.
0118	COOPER	Oh, yeah, you did.
0119	TRUMP	I tweeted.
0120	TRUMP	No, no, I tweeted.
0121	COOPER	A tweet is a suggestion.
0122	TRUMP	Should I press charges?
0123	COOPER	Are you going to?
0124	TRUMP	Sure!
0125	TRUMP	I dont know.
0126	TRUMP	Maybe I should, right?
0127	TRUMP	Because you know what?
0128	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
0129	TRUMP	She was grabbing me.
0130	TRUMP	And just so you understand, she was off base because she went through the Secret Service.
0131	TRUMP	She had a pen in her hand which Secret Service is not liking because they dont know what it is, whether its a little bomb or 
0132	COOPER	So it doesnt concern you that initially Corey Lewandowski said I never touched her, and that turns out not to be true?
0133	TRUMP	I dont think he knew her.
0134	TRUMP	I mean, based on what I heard, I dont think he really even knew who she was.
0135	TRUMP	To the best of my knowledge, they really didnt know each other.
0136	TRUMP	Or he said he doesnt know her.
0137	TRUMP	But listen to this I almost fell to the ground, which is untrue, but was able to maintain my balance. She had no trouble with her balance because its right on tape.
0138	TRUMP	Nonetheless, I was shaken.
0139	TRUMP	Campaign managers arent supposed to try to forcefully throw reporters to the ground. She didnt go to the ground!
0140	TRUMP	She didnt even have an expression on her face.
0141	COOPER	Do you think this is politically motivated?
0142	TRUMP	It could be.
0143	TRUMP	I dont know.
0144	TRUMP	Look, Ill tell you what a friend of mine whos in law enforcement said to me, theres probably not a detective in the world that would have done what they did to him.
0145	TRUMP	I mean, people in Syria 
0146	COOPER	The state attorneys a Democrat.
0147	TRUMP	Excuse me, excuse me.
0148	TRUMP	Oh, really?
0149	TRUMP	Oh, Im shocked to hear that.
0150	TRUMP	You know,
0151	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0152	TRUMP	You know, people, are chopping off heads in the Middle East.
0153	TRUMP	Theyre drowning people in cages by 50s.
0154	TRUMP	Theyre drowning  heres a guy  she shouldnt have been touching me.
0155	TRUMP	Okay?
0156	TRUMP	And you saw that she did that.
0157	TRUMP	She was grabbing me.
0158	TRUMP	Twice.
0159	TRUMP	I looked at her.
0160	TRUMP	In fact, one of the great pictures is me going like this like, get away from me, who is this person?
0161	TRUMP	Okay?
0162	TRUMP	But my arm, its never been the same, folks.
0163	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0164	TRUMP	Never been the same.
0165	TRUMP	So let me just tell you, she went through Secret Service, boom.
0166	TRUMP	She grabbed me, and he really stepped in front of her.
0167	TRUMP	I didnt see the grab he stepped in front of her.
0168	TRUMP	She wasnt supposed to be asking questions because the press conference lasted for 45 minutes, and all questions were done.
0169	TRUMP	And I was walking rapidly outside.
0170	COOPER	But this is the second time Lewandowski has touched somebody.
0171	COOPER	He did this to a protester, he grabbed a guy by the collar.
0172	COOPER	Something which you actually backed him up on And you said 
0173	TRUMP	I back people up.
0174	TRUMP	And I back up (INAUDIBLE).
0175	TRUMP	Did you see what he did?
0176	TRUMP	Did you see what he did?
0177	COOPER	I did.
0178	COOPER	In fact, theres the video right there.
0179	TRUMP	Did you see the sign the protester was holding?
0180	COOPER	No I didnt.
0181	TRUMP	Did you see what was on that sign?
0182	COOPER	No, I didnt.
0183	TRUMP	Do me a favor.
0184	TRUMP	Take a look at what was on the sign.
0185	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0186	COOPER	But should your campaign manager be laying hands on anybody?
0187	TRUMP	Excuse me.
0188	TRUMP	Did you see the protester grabbing the woman in front of him?
0189	TRUMP	With his hands on her neck?
0190	COOPER	No.
0191	TRUMP	OK. Take a look.
0192	TRUMP	You know what he did?
0193	TRUMP	He had his shirt with two fingers like this, and then he let go because security was behind him, and they took off.
0194	COOPER	Your opponents are suggesting, on the Republican side, are suggesting that this says something about your leadership, that youre condoning this kind of thing 
0195	TRUMP	Oh, I think my leadership is very good.
0196	TRUMP	Ive watched Ted Cruz, I watched him.
0197	TRUMP	He didnt even know what state he comes from, OK?
0198	TRUMP	I watched him talking about he comes from the state of Florida.
0199	TRUMP	Fort Hood is in Texas, by the way.
0200	TRUMP	But if you see what he said.
0201	TRUMP	I dont know.
0202	TRUMP	Im so surprised with him, Anderson, that you let him get away with that.
0203	TRUMP	But Ill tell you what.
0204	TRUMP	You just take a look  you just take a look at whats going on.
0205	TRUMP	I stick up for people when theyre right.
0206	TRUMP	I would have loved to have fired  it would have been much easier than talking to you about this all night long.
0207	TRUMP	Id rather talk about the issues, to be honest.
0208	TRUMP	But I stick up 
0209	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0210	TRUMP	Right?
0211	TRUMP	I stick up for people when people are unjustly accused.
0212	TRUMP	And in my opinion, unjustly accused.
0213	TRUMP	Shes grabbing me.
0214	TRUMP	He walks in to stop it.
0215	TRUMP	She walked through Secret Service.
0216	TRUMP	She had a pen in her hand, which could have been a knife, it could have been just a pen, which is very dangerous.
0217	TRUMP	She should not have been doing that.
0218	TRUMP	And she didnt fall to the ground.
0219	TRUMP	She wasnt dragged to the ground and all of the things that she said, Anderson.
0220	TRUMP	I stick up for people, and I dont want to ruin somebodys life.
0221	TRUMP	It would have been very easy for me to do so.
0222	TRUMP	You know, when I owned Miss Universe, I had the case of the young woman who was very unjustly accused by somebody that you know very well.
0223	TRUMP	And I gave her a second chance.
0224	TRUMP	And Im very proud of her.
0225	TRUMP	She had a tremendous substance abuse problem and Im very  Tara, Im very, very proud of her.
0226	TRUMP	Im very proud of the job she did.
0227	COOPER	I want to ask you about another tweet you sent.
0228	COOPER	You sent a tweet over the weekend about the death toll in this horrible terror attack in Pakistan over the weekend.
0229	TRUMP	Right.
0230	COOPER	You talked about the death toll.
0231	COOPER	And then you said, I alone can solve.
0232	COOPER	What do you mean by that?
0233	TRUMP	I think I alone because I know my competition.
0234	TRUMP	Look, I know my competition.
0235	COOPER	You, alone, among the Republican candidates.
0236	TRUMP	I see Hillary with Benghazi, you know the famous ad, 300 in the morning, guess what, the phone rang, she wasnt there.
0237	TRUMP	Unless Sidney called, if Sidney called she was there.
0238	COOPER	But youre the only one who can solve terror problems in Pakistan?
0239	COOPER	I mean, Pakistan
0240	TRUMP	Yes, of the ones that are running, Im the only one.
0241	TRUMP	I know what Im running.
0242	TRUMP	I know the competition.
0243	TRUMP	And believe me, I know, I watched Ted Cruz.
0244	COOPER	How though?
0245	COOPER	I mean, what
0246	TRUMP	So phony.
0247	TRUMP	I mean, you know, I know you have couple people out there because he put them in the audience.
0248	TRUMP	But its so false.
0249	TRUMP	You know, the whole thing with the fivesecond intermissions between sentences.
0250	TRUMP	No.
0251	TRUMP	Yes, I think I am the one to be able to solve the problem.
0252	COOPER	But, I mean, theres problems in a lot of different countries, problems in the United States.
0253	COOPER	How can you solve the problems all the way over in Pakistan when the Pakistanis, themselves, are struggling with it?
0254	TRUMP	Look, look, Pakistan is a very, very vital problem and really vital country for us because they have a thing called nuclear weapons.
0255	TRUMP	They have to get a hold of their situation.
0256	TRUMP	When I see that and when I see it put in a park because it was mostly Christians, although many others were killed other than Christians, I think its just absolutely a horrible story.
0257	TRUMP	But Im talking about radical Islamic terrorism.
0258	TRUMP	I will solve it far better than anybody else running.
0259	COOPER	Lets talk about nuclear issues because you talked about this in a really interesting article in The New York Times.
0260	TRUMP	One of the very, very big issues.
0261	TRUMP	I think maybe the biggest issue of our time.
0262	COOPER	Thats what you said to The New York Times.
0263	COOPER	You said you worried about the proliferation of nuclear weapons
0264	TRUMP	Right.
0265	COOPER	 the most.
0266	COOPER	You also said, though, that you might support Japan and South Korea developing nuclear weapons of their own.
0267	COOPER	Isnt that completely contradictory?
0268	TRUMP	No, not at all.
0269	TRUMP	Look, you have North Korea has nuclear weapons.
0270	TRUMP	And he doesnt have a carrier yet but he has got nuclear weapons.
0271	TRUMP	He soon will have.
0272	TRUMP	We dont want to pull the trigger.
0273	TRUMP	Were just  you know, we have a president, frankly, that doesnt  nobody is afraid of our president.
0274	TRUMP	Nobody respects our president.
0275	TRUMP	You take a look at whats going on throughout the world.
0276	TRUMP	Its not the country that it was.
0277	COOPER	But if youre concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isnt that proliferation?
0278	TRUMP	No, no.
0279	TRUMP	We owe $19 $trillion, we have another $2 trillion because of the very, very bad omnibus budget that was just signed.
0280	TRUMP	Its a disgrace, which gives everything that Obama wanted.
0281	TRUMP	We get nothing.
0282	TRUMP	They get everything.
0283	TRUMP	So thats going to be $21 trillion.
0284	TRUMP	We are supporting nations now, militarily, we are supporting nations like Saudi Arabia which was making during the good oil days which was a year ago, now theyre making less but still a lot, $1 billion a day.
0285	TRUMP	We are supporting them, militarily, and pay us a fraction, a fraction of what they should be paying us and of the cost.
0286	TRUMP	We are supporting Japan.
0287	TRUMP	Most people didnt even know that.
0288	TRUMP	Most people didnt know that we are taking care of Japans military needs.
0289	TRUMP	Were supporting
0290	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0291	TRUMP	Excuse me, excuse me, were supporting Germany.
0292	TRUMP	Were supporting South Korea.
0293	TRUMP	I order thousands of television sets because I am in the real estate business, you know, in my other life, OK.
0294	COOPER	It has been a U.S. policy for decades to prevent Japan from getting a nuclear weapon.
0295	TRUMP	That might be policy, but maybe
0296	COOPER	South Korea as well.
0297	TRUMP	Can I be honest are you?
0298	TRUMP	Maybe its going to have to be time to change, because so many people, you have Pakistan has it, you have China has it.
0299	TRUMP	You have so many other countries are now having it
0300	COOPER	So some proliferation is OK?
0301	TRUMP	No, no, not proliferation.
0302	TRUMP	I hate nuclear more than any.
0303	TRUMP	My uncle was a professor was at MIT, used to (AUDIO GAP) nuclear, he used to tell me about the problem.
0304	COOPER	But thats contradictory about Japan and South Korea.
0305	TRUMP	(AUDIO GAP) Iran is going to have it very  within
0306	COOPER	But thats proliferation.
0307	TRUMP	Excuse me, one of the dumbest Ive ever seen signed ever, ever, ever by anybody, Iran is going to have it within 10 years.
0308	TRUMP	Iran is going to have it.
0309	TRUMP	I thought it was a very good interview in The New York Times.
0310	COOPER	So you have no problem with Japan and South Korea having
0311	TRUMP	I thought
0312	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0313	COOPER	 nuclear weapons.
0314	TRUMP	At some point we have to say, you know what, were better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea, were better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself, we have
0315	COOPER	Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?
0316	TRUMP	Saudi Arabia, absolutely.
0317	COOPER	You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?
0318	TRUMP	No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us.
0319	TRUMP	Heres the thing, with Japan, they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves.
0320	COOPER	So if you said, Japan, yes, its fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well, and Saudi Arabia says we want them, too?
0321	TRUMP	Can I be honest with you?
0322	TRUMP	Its going to happen, anyway.
0323	TRUMP	Its going to happen anyway.
0324	TRUMP	Its only a question of time.
0325	TRUMP	Theyre going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely.
0326	TRUMP	But you have so many countries already, China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia, you have so many countries right now that have them.
0327	TRUMP	Now, wouldnt you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?
0328	TRUMP	And they do have them.
0329	TRUMP	They absolutely have them.
0330	TRUMP	They cant  they have no carrier system yet but they will very soon.
0331	TRUMP	Wouldnt you rather have Japan, perhaps, theyre over there, theyre very close, theyre very fearful of North Korea, and were supposed to protect.
0332	COOPER	So youre saying you dont want more nuclear weapons in the world but youre OK with Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons?
0333	TRUMP	I dont want more nuclear weapons.
0334	TRUMP	I think that  you know, when I hear Obama get up and say the biggest threat to the world today is global warming, I say, is this guy kidding?
0335	TRUMP	The only global warming  the only global warming Im worried about is nuclear global warming because thats the single biggest threat.
0336	TRUMP	So its not that Im a fan  we cant afford it anymore.
0337	TRUMP	Were sitting on a tremendous bubble.
0338	TRUMP	Were going to be  again, $21 trillion.
0339	TRUMP	We dont have money.
0340	COOPER	So you have no security concerns
0341	TRUMP	Were using all of the money
0342	COOPER	 about Japan or South Korea getting nuclear weapons?
0343	TRUMP	Anderson, when you see all of the money that our country is spending on military, were not spending it for ourselves were protecting all of these nations all over the world.
0344	TRUMP	We cant afford to do it anymore.
0345	COOPER	But isnt there benefit for the United States in having a secure Europe.
0346	COOPER	Isnt there benefit for the United States in having a secure Asia.
0347	TRUMP	Theres a benefit, but not big enough to bankrupt and destroy the United States, because thats whats happening.
0348	TRUMP	We cant afford it.
0349	TRUMP	Its very simple.
0350	TRUMP	Now, I would rather see Japan having some form of defense, and maybe even offense, against North Korea.
0351	TRUMP	Because were not pulling the trigger.
0352	TRUMP	The bottom line on North Korea is china, if they wanted to, theyre a tremendous supplier of North Korea.
0353	TRUMP	They have tremendous power over North Korea.
0354	TRUMP	If they wanted to, if they werent toying with us, Anderson, China would be the one that would get in and could make a deal in one day, okay
0355	COOPER	I want to bring into the audience just a moment.
0356	COOPER	Just a last question before we do.
0357	COOPER	Ive got to ask you about this back and forth between you and Senator Cruz about wives.
0358	COOPER	After saying that you were going to spill the beans about Heidi Cruz, you retweeted an unflattering picture of her next to a picture of your wife.
0359	TRUMP	I thought it was a nice picture of Heidi.
0360	TRUMP	I thought it was fine.
0361	COOPER	Come on.
0362	TRUMP	I thought it was fine.
0363	TRUMP	Shes a pretty woman.
0364	COOPER	Youre running for president of the United States.
0365	TRUMP	Excuse me, I didnt start it.
0366	TRUMP	I didnt start it.
0367	COOPER	But, sir, with all due respect, thats the argument of 5yearold.
0368	TRUMP	No, its not.
0369	COOPER	The argument of a 5yearold is he started it.
0370	TRUMP	You would say that.
0371	TRUMP	Thats the problem with our country.
0372	COOPER	Every parent knows a kid who says he started it.
0373	TRUMP	Thats not a 5yearold.
0374	TRUMP	Excuse.
0375	TRUMP	No, no, no.
0376	TRUMP	Thats the problem.
0377	TRUMP	Exactly that thinking is the problem this country has.
0378	TRUMP	I did not start this.
0379	TRUMP	He sent out a picture and he knew very well it was a picture
0380	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0381	COOPER	He didnt send out a picture.
0382	COOPER	It was an antiTrump super PAC sent out.
0383	TRUMP	Anderson, it was a cover story of a picture taken by Antoine Verglas, one of the great photographers of the world, by the way.
0384	TRUMP	My wife was a very, very successful model, like one of the most.
0385	COOPER	A very successful model of course.
0386	TRUMP	It was a picture for the cover of GQ, which is a decent  which is a very good magazine.
0387	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0388	COOPER	It wasnt even a proCruz super PAC it was an antiTrump super PAC.
0389	TRUMP	Excuse me, they were Romney people.
0390	TRUMP	Romney is, you know, very embarrassed that he did so badly four years ago.
0391	TRUMP	The guy choked like a dog and lost an election
0392	COOPER	Do you have proof that he sent it out?
0393	TRUMP	No, everybody knows he sent it out.
0394	TRUMP	He knew the people in the super PAC.
0395	TRUMP	He knew  I would be willing to bet he wrote the phrase.
0396	TRUMP	You know, this is  would you like to have this as your first lady?
0397	TRUMP	And a lot of people said, yes, actually, if you want to know the truth.
0398	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0399	TRUMP	But she was a magnificent model.
0400	TRUMP	She took a picture with one of the great photographers of the world.
0401	TRUMP	They put it on GQ. All of a sudden we see this picture going all over Utah just before the election.
0402	TRUMP	And by the way, when he said, We had a big day, we won Utah. Excuse me, I won Arizona with far more delegates, and as you probably saw, 25 minutes ago, so maybe you didnt see it, the vote was just counted in Missouri and I won Missouri, too.
0403	COOPER	Congratulations.
0404	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0405	TRUMP	Picked up another 12 or 13 delegates.
0406	COOPER	Your wife is lovely, shes very intelligent.
0407	COOPER	Heidi Cruz, I havent interviewed her  she seems like a very intelligent, very accomplished person as well.
0408	COOPER	Can you just leave wives out of this?
0409	TRUMP	Absolutely.
0410	TRUMP	Id like to do it.
0411	COOPER	But why retweet  why retweet somebody?
0412	TRUMP	I would love to do it.
0413	TRUMP	I really would rather talk about nuclear proliferation.
0414	TRUMP	Its a slightly more important subject.
0415	COOPER	You act as if retweeting is not an endorsement.
0416	TRUMP	Let me just tell you something, I would love to do it.
0417	TRUMP	I didnt send the photo to everybody in the state of Utah.
0418	TRUMP	He did.
0419	TRUMP	He knew about it.
0420	TRUMP	It was his people, who were his friends.
0421	TRUMP	It was a PAC thats
0422	COOPER	Couldnt you just let it go, though?
0423	COOPER	Do you have to retweet some random person sending you
0424	TRUMP	No, I dont let things go so easy.
0425	TRUMP	And let me tell you something.
0426	TRUMP	I dont let the  if I were running the country, I wouldnt have people taking advantage of the United States in trade and in every other way, either.
0427	TRUMP	Believe me, I wouldnt have China walking away with trade deficits of $505 billion a year.
0428	TRUMP	I wouldnt have Mexico laughing at us how stupid we are with trade deals, and at the border.
0429	TRUMP	I wouldnt let Japan get away what theyre doing with, you know, devaluation of the yen.
0430	TRUMP	China big league devaluation.
0431	TRUMP	No, I  when somebody
0432	COOPER	Can you say tonight, though, no more such about wives?
0433	TRUMP	Oh, absolutely.
0434	TRUMP	I dont want to talk about that.
0435	TRUMP	Its ridiculous to be talking about that.
0436	COOPER	All right, lets go to the audience.
0437	COOPER	I want you to meet retired Lieutenant Brian Murphy.
0438	COOPER	He as first the officer to report to the Sikh temple massacre in Oak Creek, and was shot 15 times.
0439	COOPER	His fellow officer, who is standing next to him, Sam Lenda
0440	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0441	COOPER	Sam Lenda took out
0442	TRUMP	Great.
0443	COOPER	His fellow officer standing next to him, Sam Lenda, took out the shooter that day, is also with us.
0444	COOPER	We wanted to just first of all take a moment to thank both of them for their service and their actions.
0445	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0446	COOPER	Brian has a question for you tonight.
0447	COOPER	He says hes  he likes Governor Kasich but hes still undecided  so Brian.
0448	QUESTION	Good evening, Mr. Trump.
0449	QUESTION	I have a question.
0450	QUESTION	In light of the Brussels and Paris attacks one of the quickest kneejerk reactions is a backlash against specific minority religious groups.
0451	QUESTION	This, in turn, brings about things that cause damage all over.
0452	QUESTION	In Milwaukee, you heard about the Sikh temple shooting.
0453	QUESTION	Six people were killed.
0454	QUESTION	99 percent of the men in the United States who wear turbans are actually Sikh and not Muslim.
0455	QUESTION	How would you suggest we help educate the public and not alienate these groups and, at the same time, how do we protect the constitutional rights of minority groups like the Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, and Jews, while still addressing radical Islamization?
0456	TRUMP	Well, Brian, thank you for the question.
0457	TRUMP	We have a tremendous problem with radical Islam whether we like it or we dont.
0458	TRUMP	We have a president who wont talk about it.
0459	TRUMP	I mean, Ted was saying the same thing.
0460	TRUMP	We have a president who wont talk about it.
0461	TRUMP	Why he wont talk about, perhaps only he knows, but its a disgrace whats going on.
0462	TRUMP	We have a serious, serious problem, and when I called for a temporary ban I thought that was a very bad thing for me to do politically, but I felt I should do it.
0463	TRUMP	And, I didnt know that I would go up in the polls opposed to down.
0464	TRUMP	I did that because I really felt there had to be something done.
0465	TRUMP	That was after the horrible San Bernardino, California situation.
0466	TRUMP	After, obviously, Paris which was terrible.
0467	TRUMP	You know, we talk about Paris with the gunfree zones, we talk about Paris with their strong gun laws, by the way.
0468	TRUMP	Nobody had guns except for the bad guys.
0469	TRUMP	If we would have had guns on the other side going, in terms of Second Amendment having to do, if bullets were  same thing with San Bernardino.
0470	TRUMP	If bullets were going in the opposite direction, you wouldnt have had the problems in those two places, that I can tell you.
0471	TRUMP	So, I think we have to be extremely careful with our Second Amendment, and we have to cherish our Second Amendment.
0472	TRUMP	Very important.
0473	TRUMP	But, I would say this, when I called for the temporary banning, we have to look at it.
0474	TRUMP	We have a serious problem, I think youll admit that, Brian.
0475	TRUMP	We have a very, very serious problem with radical Islam, and if we dont want to discuss it, and if we dont want to look at it, were never going to solve the problem.
0476	TRUMP	We have to be extremely strong with ISIS.
0477	TRUMP	We have to wipe ISIS off the face of the Earth so fast and so violently we have no choice.
0478	TRUMP	We have no choice.
0479	TRUMP	And, I was against the war in Iraq.
0480	TRUMP	OK?
0481	TRUMP	I am not a fast trigger.
0482	TRUMP	Im exactly the opposite of that.
0483	TRUMP	We should have never gone in, it destabilized the Middle East.
0484	TRUMP	But, I will tell you this, we got out.
0485	TRUMP	Obama got us out very badly.
0486	TRUMP	Instead of leaving some troops, instead of giving a date, instead of, you know, with the exact time, I would say this though  we have no choice but to look at that.
0487	TRUMP	We have to be very, very vigilant.
0488	TRUMP	Very smart, and frankly, Brian, we have to be very tough because its only going to get worse.
0489	TRUMP	Thousands of people are being allowed into this country over short periods of time coming supposedly from Syria.
0490	TRUMP	We have no idea who they are, we have no idea where is their paperwork.
0491	TRUMP	They have no paperwork they have no identification.
0492	TRUMP	Theyre coming into this country and its going to be a big, big problem.
0493	COOPER	The other, though, part of Lieutenant Murphys question was about protecting the rights of minority groups, of Muslims, or Sikhs, of Jews, and others inside the United States
0494	TRUMP	 I want to do that also, and I do want to do that, but I at the same time we have to recognize we have a serious problem.
0495	COOPER	Let me follow up on that.
0496	COOPER	You said you agreed, I think you said you agreed, with Senator Ted Cruzs proposal in the wake of the Brussels attack that law enforcement should, quote, patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized. I talked to him about this in the last hour.
0497	COOPER	Bill Bratton, Commissioner, the Chief of Police
0498	TRUMP	 Who I like very much
0499	COOPER	 In your home city.
0500	COOPER	Chief of Police under Giuliani, as well as now de Blasio, again  out in L.A.
0501	COOPER	He said about Ted Cruzs proposal, we do not patrol and secure neighborhoods based on selective enforcement because of race or religion. Is he wrong?
0502	TRUMP	I think we have to be extremely vigilant in those areas, we have to look very seriously at the Mosques.
0503	TRUMP	Lots of things happening in the Mosques, thats been proven.
0504	TRUMP	You look at whats going on in Paris where Mosques are being closed, OK?
0505	TRUMP	And, we have to look very, very seriously.
0506	COOPER	Theres a lot of Muslims in America who hear that, saying we got to look seriously at the Mosques
0507	TRUMP	 Let me just tell you something, in San Bernadino people know what was going on.
0508	TRUMP	These two people  probably became radicalized through her.
0509	TRUMP	Who knows?
0510	TRUMP	Frankly, right now, it doesnt matter.
0511	TRUMP	But, these two people want to kill their coworkers, et cetera, et cetera, in their apartment, or their house.
0512	TRUMP	In their place where they lived, they had bombs all over the apartment
0513	COOPER	 Do you trust
0514	TRUMP	 Excuse me  they had bombs on the floor.
0515	TRUMP	Many people saw this.
0516	TRUMP	Many, many people.
0517	TRUMP	Muslims living with them in the same area.
0518	TRUMP	They saw that house, they saw that.
0519	TRUMP	One didnt want to turn them in.
0520	TRUMP	He said I dont know turn them in because I dont want to be accused of racial profiling.
0521	TRUMP	He saw bombs all over the apartment, OK?
0522	TRUMP	Its just an excuse
0523	COOPER	 Do you trust Muslims in America?
0524	TRUMP	 Do I what?
0525	COOPER	Trust Muslims in America?
0526	TRUMP	Many of them I do.
0527	TRUMP	Many of them I do, and some, I guess, we dont.
0528	TRUMP	Some, I guess, we dont.
0529	TRUMP	We have a problem, and we can try and be very politically correct and pretend we dont have a problem, but, Anderson, we have a major, major problem.
0530	TRUMP	This is, in a sense, this is a war
0531	COOPER	 So, special patrols in Muslim neighborhoods
0532	TRUMP	 You know, nobody wants to call it a war  excuse me.
0533	TRUMP	Nobody wants to call it a war.
0534	TRUMP	Its a war.
0535	TRUMP	Theres a war.
0536	TRUMP	The difference is its not like youre fighting Germany or Japan where they have a uniform, we have a uniform, everybody has a different uniform.
0537	TRUMP	We dont know where these people are.
0538	COOPER	I want you to meet Jeff Johns.
0539	COOPER	Hes a financial consultant.
0540	COOPER	He said he is on the Trump train as of this point.
0541	TRUMP	I like him.
0542	TRUMP	I like him very much.
0543	COOPER	I knew you would.
0544	TRUMP	I like him.
0545	QUESTION	Thank you for coming to the great city of Milwaukee.
0546	TRUMP	Thank you, Jeff.
0547	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, you have a high net worth in the billions of dollars but many people dont think that youre a successful businessman.
0548	QUESTION	They refer to your inherited wealth and how its just a track that pays the average market index.
0549	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, what do you say to those people that do not think that youre a successful businessman?
0550	TRUMP	Yes, I love the question because its such lies.
0551	TRUMP	I started off in Brooklyn.
0552	TRUMP	My father was a builder in Brooklyn.
0553	TRUMP	Brooklyn had not a lot of value.
0554	TRUMP	Brooklyn was not a great place to be.
0555	TRUMP	I wanted to always go into Manhattan.
0556	TRUMP	My father, my first deal and my first loan was $1 million from my father which was a loan, I had to pay him back.
0557	TRUMP	I did numerous deals in Manhattan.
0558	TRUMP	My father said, dont go into Manhattan, its not our territory, we cant do that, its not for us.
0559	TRUMP	I started off with a very, very small amount of money.
0560	TRUMP	And by the way, when my father passed away, remember, I have four  I have a total of five in my family.
0561	TRUMP	So we have brothers, sisters, split.
0562	TRUMP	And when my father died, by that time I had already built a great fortune and my father didnt leave a great fortune.
0563	TRUMP	It was Brooklyn and Queens real estate and it wasnt a great fortune.
0564	TRUMP	But now what they do is they build it up like, oh, he left Donald money.
0565	TRUMP	I started off  and you understand, you know the true answer because youre somebody that understands me and you understand where it started.
0566	TRUMP	I started off with $1 million and now Im worth over $10 billion.
0567	TRUMP	And I filed my papers with the election committees, with the federal election, and people in your world, in your profession, are down there, or have been down there all the time and they cant believe how great those papers are.
0568	TRUMP	Very little debt.
0569	TRUMP	Some of the greatest assets in the world.
0570	TRUMP	Some of the greatest assets in the world.
0571	TRUMP	And, very importantly, tremendous cash flow.
0572	TRUMP	And I dont say that in a bragging way.
0573	TRUMP	I say that because thats the kind of thinking that our country needs.
0574	TRUMP	And I want to say this, before my father died, he said, everything Donald touches turns to gold.
0575	TRUMP	Its absolutely  he was so proud of me.
0576	TRUMP	But I borrowed very little money from my father.
0577	TRUMP	What I did borrow and the thing that really helped me with my father was his knowledge.
0578	TRUMP	He was an excellent negotiator.
0579	TRUMP	He was an excellent builder.
0580	TRUMP	But he built in Brooklyn and Queens, there wasnt that much money in Brooklyn and Queens.
0581	COOPER	A lot of other candidates have released tax returns.
0582	COOPER	You say you wont release them because youre being audited.
0583	COOPER	There are some people who doubt youre even being audited or have been audited as much as
0584	TRUMP	Oh, I can give you a letter for that.
0585	TRUMP	Would you like a letter?
0586	TRUMP	Ill give you
0587	COOPER	Can you?
0588	TRUMP	Ill give it to you, sure, absolutely.
0589	COOPER	Because some people have raised that as a doubt.
0590	TRUMP	And only a fool would give a tax return
0591	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0592	COOPER	So you can offer evidence that you are being audited or have been audited like you say?
0593	TRUMP	A hundred percent.
0594	TRUMP	Ill give you a letter from the biggest firm in Washington that does my work for me.
0595	COOPER	All right.
0596	TRUMP	OK?
0597	COOPER	I want you to meet Robert Kitelinger.
0598	COOPER	Hes retired from the U.S. Army after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
0599	COOPER	Hes now a student at Marquette University
0600	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0601	COOPER	Robert?
0602	QUESTION	Good evening, Mr. Trump.
0603	QUESTION	In your opinion, what are the top three functions of the United States government?
0604	TRUMP	Say it again?
0605	QUESTION	In your opinion, what are the top three functions of the United States government?
0606	TRUMP	Well, the greatest function of all by far is security for our nation.
0607	TRUMP	I would also say health care, I would also say education.
0608	TRUMP	I mean, there are many, many things, but I would say the top three are security, security, security.
0609	TRUMP	We have to have security for our country so that we can continue to exist as a country.
0610	TRUMP	We are in danger.
0611	TRUMP	Thousands and thousands of people are infiltrating our country.
0612	TRUMP	We dont know who they are.
0613	TRUMP	Theres a very vicious world.
0614	TRUMP	Were living in a very vicious world and were doing something that is against a lot of very smart peoples wishes.
0615	TRUMP	I can tell you, its totally against my wishes.
0616	COOPER	So top three, youre saying, security.
0617	TRUMP	Security.
0618	TRUMP	I say all top three are security, but health care, education, would be probably three that would be top.
0619	TRUMP	And then you can go on from there.
0620	TRUMP	But the military and the secure country, so that we have a country.
0621	TRUMP	Believe me, weve never been in a position, in my opinion, where our country is so vulnerable.
0622	TRUMP	Our military is being eaten away.
0623	TRUMP	When General Odierno left recently, a year ago, I was watching him on maybe your show, one of the shows, and he said that the United States Army, the United States military forces have never been so  and I think he used the word depleted.
0624	TRUMP	But basically he said theyre exhausted.
0625	COOPER	So just to followup, though
0626	TRUMP	And thats a pretty  thats a pretty sad commentary.
0627	TRUMP	And honestly, even though he was retiring at the time  and I had a lot of respect for him, good man, but even though he was leaving at the time, people shouldnt say that because youre giving the enemy ideas.
0628	TRUMP	But if I get in, our military will be bigger, better, stronger than ever before.
0629	TRUMP	Its the cheapest thing we can do.
0630	COOPER	So in terms of federal government role, youre saying security, but you also say health care and education should be provided by the federal government?
0631	TRUMP	Well, those are two of the things.
0632	TRUMP	Yes, sure.
0633	TRUMP	I mean, there are obviously many things, housing, providing great neighborhoods
0634	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0635	COOPER	Arent you against the federal governments involvement in education?
0636	COOPER	dont you want it to devolve to states?
0637	TRUMP	I want it to go to state, yes.
0638	TRUMP	Absolutely.
0639	TRUMP	I want  right now
0640	COOPER	So thats not part of what the federal governments
0641	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0642	TRUMP	The federal government, but the concept of the country is the concept that we have to have education within the country, and we have to get rid of common core and it should be brought to the state level.
0643	COOPER	And federal health care run by the federal government?
0644	TRUMP	Health care  we need health care for our people.
0645	TRUMP	We need a good  Obamacare is a disaster.
0646	TRUMP	Its proven to be
0647	COOPER	But is that something the federal government should be doing?
0648	TRUMP	The government can lead it, but it should be privately done.
0649	TRUMP	It should be privately done.
0650	TRUMP	So that health care  in my opinion, we should probably have  we have to have private health care.
0651	TRUMP	We dont have competition in health care.
0652	TRUMP	The problem that we have in our country is we dont have competition.
0653	TRUMP	Its made because the politicians  by the way, Im selffunding.
0654	TRUMP	I am selffunding.
0655	TRUMP	So the health care companies arent taking care of me.
0656	TRUMP	But theyre taking care of everyone else.
0657	TRUMP	Wait one second.
0658	TRUMP	We dont have  we dont have bidding.
0659	TRUMP	We dont have competition in health care.
0660	TRUMP	And its a disaster.
0661	TRUMP	Obamacare, if you take a look at your premiums, theyre going up 35 percent, 45 percent, 55 percent, and the deductibles are so high, youll never get to use it.
0662	COOPER	You always say youre selffunding.
0663	COOPER	How much do you think your campaign has cost  in the past you said $25 million.
0664	TRUMP	I can tell you, Id say Im in right now for  now, Im in for about $35 million right now.
0665	COOPER	Okay.
0666	TRUMP	We take the small loans, the people that send $17.50, or $250, even $1,000
0667	COOPER	And you solicit those on your website.
0668	TRUMP	No, I sell hats and shirts and
0669	COOPER	No, but you do solicit donations on your website?
0670	TRUMP	No, I dont really think so.
0671	COOPER	Yes, you do.
0672	COOPER	You have two spots (ph), where you do.
0673	TRUMP	Okay, whatever.
0674	TRUMP	Whatever.
0675	TRUMP	Its peanuts.
0676	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0677	COOPER	Its not peanuts its $7 million  its a lot of money.
0678	TRUMP	Ill tell you what, what Ive done is Im in for about $35 million.
0679	COOPER	Its about a third of your campaign is funded by other people.
0680	TRUMP	No its not.
0681	TRUMP	No, its not, not a third.
0682	TRUMP	Whatever the hats are, they also cost something.
0683	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0684	COOPER	Well, according to the FTC youve raised more than, I think, $7 million last time I checked from individual donations.
0685	TRUMP	Let me put it differently.
0686	TRUMP	I am not soliciting money from insurance companies and from lumber companies and from banks and from  if I did, I would have made Jeb Bush look like a baby.
0687	TRUMP	I have turned down more $10 million offers.
0688	TRUMP	Just the other night, Im in Florida, and a very, very rich friend of mine comes up, Donald, Id like to give you $10 million, Ill give you anything
0689	COOPER	Youve actually been loaning your campaign a lot of money.
0690	COOPER	Are you going to have your campaign pay you back?
0691	TRUMP	I doubt it.
0692	TRUMP	But it just seems to be the way its done.
0693	COOPER	But thats a possibility?
0694	TRUMP	I dont know  can I be honest?
0695	TRUMP	I never even thought about it.
0696	TRUMP	I never even thought about it.
0697	COOPER	Okay.
0698	TRUMP	Just seems to me the way the lawyers set it up.
0699	TRUMP	But I am in right now, I put in my money, about $35 million.
0700	TRUMP	I think in terms of small donations, I think weve received $6 million up until this point.
0701	COOPER	I think I saw $7 million.
0702	TRUMP	Excuse me.
0703	TRUMP	A lot of that is the selling of merchandise and things like that.
0704	COOPER	I want to
0705	TRUMP	Theres no influence over me.
0706	TRUMP	Its not like the banks are giving me money and Im going to do favors for the banks.
0707	TRUMP	You look at Ted Cruz, the banks are giving him a lot of money.
0708	TRUMP	The oil and gas are giving him a lot of money.
0709	TRUMP	A lot of people are giving him a lot of money.
0710	TRUMP	And by the way super PACs are a disaster, and theyre a disaster waiting to happen, folks, and if theyre not gotten rid of, its only going to get worse.
0711	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0712	COOPER	I want to introduce you to Amelia Roll (ph).

0717	COOPER	Heres your chance to win her over  Amelia.
0718	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, thank you so much for being here tonight.
0719	TRUMP	Thank you.
0720	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, in a recent interview with the Washington Post, you said that the U.S. should become a diminishing presence in NATO.
0721	TRUMP	Absolutely.
0722	COOPER	Why do you think that the U.S. should start to withdraw their world presence from NATO, and what would you change about the organization so that we could remain involved?
0723	TRUMP	Okay, I did two basic and very large interviews recently.
0724	TRUMP	I did the New York Times, which treated me unbelievably fairly.
0725	TRUMP	And there was a frontpage story on Sunday or  I think, and It was a great story.
0726	TRUMP	And part of it was NATO  and the other was the Washington Post.
0727	COOPER	I think you talked to them longer than any other candidate, by the way, on the Republican side.
0728	TRUMP	I spoke to the Times?
0729	COOPER	Yes.
0730	TRUMP	Well, I spoke to them a long time.
0731	TRUMP	David, hes a very talented writer actually.
0732	TRUMP	And they treated me very fairly.
0733	TRUMP	I also did the Washington Post, where I said very similar things, and very similar things about NATO.
0734	TRUMP	Let me tell you, NATO is obsolete.
0735	TRUMP	It was 67 years, or its over 60 years old.
0736	TRUMP	It is  many countries, doesnt cover terrorism, okay?
0737	TRUMP	it covers the Soviet Union which is no longer in existence.
0738	TRUMP	And NATO has to either be rejiggered, changed for the better.
0739	TRUMP	Im not saying  the other thing thats bad about NATO, were paying too much.
0740	TRUMP	Were spending a tremendous  billions and billions of dollars on NATO.
0741	COOPER	Youre saying its obsolete, though.
0742	COOPER	You have now Vladimir Putin invade invading Crimea, annexing part of Ukraine  annexing Crimea.
0743	TRUMP	Let me tell you about Ukraine.
0744	TRUMP	First of all
0745	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0746	COOPER	There a lot of people who believe NATO is more important
0747	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0748	TRUMP	You have countries that surround Ukraine.
0749	TRUMP	They dont talk.
0750	TRUMP	They dont seem to have a problem.
0751	TRUMP	Im not saying go in.
0752	TRUMP	Id say be very strong, you can be strong without necessarily even being (INAUDIBLE) or the money we spend.
0753	TRUMP	The money we spend is astronomical on NATO.
0754	TRUMP	Okay?
0755	TRUMP	The Ukraine 
0756	COOPER	You really think NATO is obsolete?
0757	TRUMP	I think its largely obsolete, yes.
0758	TRUMP	Its got to be changed.
0759	TRUMP	Its got to be  you dont talk about terror.
0760	TRUMP	Our single biggest threat right now is terror, okay?
0761	TRUMP	Now thats an amorphous term, but its terror.
0762	TRUMP	Our single biggest threat 
0763	COOPER	So you would like to see an organization revamped, either NATO 
0764	TRUMP	Either revamped  NATO, now if you do that, youre going to have to obviously have to add different nations in because you have nations that arent in NATO that are very much into the world of terror.
0765	TRUMP	Both in terms of causing it and receiving it.
0766	TRUMP	So youd probably have to either start something or you have to do something.
0767	TRUMP	When you look at Brussels, hey, look.
0768	TRUMP	You remember a couple of months ago, I made a statement about Brussels.
0769	TRUMP	I said its a hell hole.
0770	TRUMP	Thats because its a financial, very big financial capital.
0771	TRUMP	Many of my friends are there.
0772	TRUMP	They know exactly whats going on.
0773	TRUMP	I havent been there in many years.
0774	TRUMP	I was there.
0775	TRUMP	It was a beautiful city.
0776	TRUMP	Now its not good.
0777	TRUMP	And I said it was a hell hole.
0778	TRUMP	The New York Times attacked me rather viciously for calling a place a hell hole.
0779	TRUMP	Two months later, we had the attack, and it turned out I was right.
0780	TRUMP	Its a hell hole.
0781	TRUMP	And on Twitter and all over the place, theyre saying Trump was right, Trump was right.
0782	TRUMP	I understand this stuff.
0783	TRUMP	I mean, I really do understand this stuff.
0784	TRUMP	NATO is obsolete.
0785	TRUMP	Now, that doesnt mean it cant be rejiggered and it cant be fixed and made good or 
0786	COOPER	And for you thats 
0787	TRUMP	Its possible 
0788	COOPER	 a financial component that when you talk about 
0789	TRUMP	Were paying too much!
0790	TRUMP	You have countries in NATO, I think its 28 countries  you have countries in NATO that are getting a free ride and its unfair, its very unfair.
0791	TRUMP	The United States cannot afford to be the policemen of the world anymore, folks.
0792	TRUMP	We have to rebuild our own country.
0793	TRUMP	We have to stop with this stuff.
0794	TRUMP	You have as an example, Ukraine.
0795	TRUMP	You dont have Germany talking about Ukraine.
0796	TRUMP	You dont have many of the countries in NATO talking about  its always us.
0797	TRUMP	Were always the first one out.
0798	TRUMP	We have very big problems in our country.
0799	TRUMP	Very, very big problems.
0800	TRUMP	NATO has to be either changed, or we have to do something.
0801	TRUMP	And we shouldnt be paying most of the course of NATO because its unfair  its unfair to our taxpayers and to our people.
0802	COOPER	Weve got to  weve got to take a quick break.
0803	COOPER	Well have more with Donald Trump right after the short break when our 360 Republican Town Hall continues from the Riverside Theater in downtown Milwaukee.
0804	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0805	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0806	COOPER	And, welcome back.
0807	COOPER	Were talking to Donald Trump.
0808	COOPER	A week before the Wisconsin primary, voters asking the Republican candidates the questions that matter to them, looking for answers to help them decide.
0809	COOPER	Before we go back to the audience, I want to ask you a question I asked to Senator Cruz as well.
0810	COOPER	more than six months ago you pledged to support the Republican nominee, whoever that may be.
0811	COOPER	A lot has changed since then.
0812	COOPER	It sounded, when I was pressing Senator Cruz on it, sounded like he was saying he was saying hed have a hard time supporting somebody who went after his wife.
0813	TRUMP	Honestly, he doesnt have to support me.
0814	TRUMP	Im not asking for his support.
0815	TRUMP	I want the peoples support.
0816	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0817	COOPER	Do you continue to pledge whoever the Republican nominee is?
0818	TRUMP	No.
0819	TRUMP	I dont anymore.
0820	COOPER	You dont?
0821	TRUMP	No, well see who it is.
0822	COOPER	You wont promise to support the Republican nominee?
0823	TRUMP	He was essentially saying the same thing.
0824	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, he doesnt have to support me.
0825	TRUMP	I have tremendous support right now from the people.
0826	TRUMP	Im way over two million votes more than him.
0827	TRUMP	I have many, many, more delegates than him.
0828	TRUMP	Like, many, many more delegates.
0829	TRUMP	As I said before, he was talking about his great victory the night Utah  well, I won Arizona.
0830	TRUMP	Many more delegates.
0831	TRUMP	Many, many more delegates.
0832	TRUMP	I dont really want him to do something hes not comfortable with.
0833	TRUMP	Just like I cant imagine Jeb Bush  look, I beat these people badly.
0834	TRUMP	I beat Jeb Bush.
0835	TRUMP	I beat the governor of this state, the governor of this state came in, he was favored to win.
0836	TRUMP	He was at 22 points.
0837	TRUMP	Then he said something bad about me and I hit him very hard, and he went boom, and he left the race.
0838	TRUMP	He was very early
0839	COOPER	Just so Im clear
0840	TRUMP	I dont want to make people uncomfortable.
0841	TRUMP	I dont need their support.
0842	TRUMP	Now, maybe it will be a negative, maybe it wont.
0843	COOPER	So, the pledge you took is null and void.
0844	COOPER	The idea of supporting whoever
0845	TRUMP	 I have defeated
0846	COOPER	 the Republican nominee is, you say you will no longer guarantee you will support the Republican nominee
0847	TRUMP	 I have been treated very unfairly.
0848	TRUMP	I won the state of Missouri, right?
0849	TRUMP	No, I have.
0850	TRUMP	Aww, Cruz people.
0851	TRUMP	Ive been treated very unfairly.
0852	COOPER	Unfairly by?
0853	TRUMP	Ill give you an example.
0854	COOPER	Who?
0855	TRUMP	I think by, basically, the RNC, the Republican party, the establishment.
0856	TRUMP	You have a guy like Mitt Romney who lost miserably, who did a terrible job.
0857	TRUMP	He was a horrible, horrible campaign.
0858	TRUMP	The last month of that  I helped him.
0859	TRUMP	I raised him a million dollars
0860	COOPER	 Do you think the RNC is plotting to take this away from you at the convention?
0861	TRUMP	I dont know, I dont know.
0862	TRUMP	I mean, well see what happens, but I think youd have a lot of very upset people if that happened.
0863	TRUMP	Just so you understand, when Romney came out against me he ran one of the worst races in the history of presidential politics.
0864	TRUMP	He ought to sit back and root for us instead of being a negative force.
0865	TRUMP	And, we have, others also.
0866	TRUMP	Im bringing millions  the biggest story in all of politics worldwide right now  and I think you might agree to this, is whats happened.
0867	TRUMP	Millions of people are coming in and voting, in all fairness, for me.
0868	COOPER	And, watching, and being involved in the process.
0869	TRUMP	And, watching all of this.
0870	TRUMP	Your ratings tonight will be excellent, right?
0871	TRUMP	The debate you had where 23 million people, I dont want to say this tragedy, Im just telling you, if I wasnt in it you would have had, what?
0872	TRUMP	Four million people
0873	COOPER	 In the off chance that youre not the Republican nominee, what would go into your decision of whether or not you would support
0874	TRUMP	 Well, Ill look at it.
0875	TRUMP	Ill see who it is.
0876	TRUMP	I mean, Im not looking to hurt anybody.
0877	TRUMP	I love the Republican party as
0878	COOPER	 If its Senator Ted Cruz, would you support him
0879	TRUMP	 Look, heres my thing on Cruz.
0880	TRUMP	A lot of nasty things have been said.
0881	TRUMP	Im a very honorably guy, and Im a very honest guy.
0882	TRUMP	I dont do  I would have never done what he did to Ben Carson who, by the way, endorsed me.
0883	TRUMP	I would have never gone to Iowa and said, Ben Carson has left the race.
0884	TRUMP	He is gone, 100 percent, vote for me.
0885	TRUMP	And they usher people into the caucus, and they try and get them to vote for Ted Cruz.
0886	TRUMP	A lot of people left Ben Carson.
0887	TRUMP	Ben Carson is an honorable guy.
0888	TRUMP	That was a terrible thing to do.
0889	TRUMP	There were other terrible things to do.
0890	TRUMP	And I  honestly, I watched him tonight with you, and I watched how tormented he was when you asked him that question.
0891	TRUMP	I dont want to have him torment.
0892	TRUMP	I dont want to have him be tormented.
0893	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, I dont want his support.
0894	TRUMP	I dont need his support.
0895	TRUMP	I want him to be comfortable.
0896	TRUMP	Now, if he wants to support me, that would be wonderful because I think Im going to win.
0897	TRUMP	But let me just tell you.
0898	TRUMP	I watched him, you know, skirt around like any politician would.
0899	TRUMP	Skirt around the issue.
0900	TRUMP	I dont want to make people like Jeb Bush, like Ted Cruz, like Governor Walker  I mean, Governor Walker, I hit him very hard after he hit me.
0901	TRUMP	But I hit him very hard and drove him out of the race.
0902	TRUMP	I drove Jeb Bush out of the race.
0903	TRUMP	I drove Rand Paul out of the race.
0904	TRUMP	I understand why they dont like me.
0905	TRUMP	And I dont want people that  I dont want people to do something against their will, Anderson.
0906	TRUMP	I could see that he was having a hard time with a very simple question that you asked him.
0907	TRUMP	Would you support, well, I think Im going to win.
0908	TRUMP	OK.
0909	TRUMP	He doesnt have to do it.
0910	TRUMP	He doesnt have to support me.
0911	TRUMP	I really dont believe I need his support.
0912	TRUMP	Id love to have everybodys support.
0913	TRUMP	You know what, Im a unifier.
0914	TRUMP	Believe it or not, Im a unifier.
0915	TRUMP	And you will see that.
0916	TRUMP	Someday you will see that.
0917	COOPER	If there was a contested convention, and you didnt get the nomination, and someone else was brought in, a Paul Ryan, for instance, would you support him?
0918	TRUMP	Well, let me explain.
0919	TRUMP	See, he was very nice.
0920	TRUMP	He called me the other day, last week, and he was very nice.
0921	TRUMP	But then I read reports that hes having meetings with people about, you know, some clandestine things.
0922	TRUMP	Lets see what happens.
0923	TRUMP	But he was very nice when he called.
0924	TRUMP	And I assume he was being straight with me.
0925	TRUMP	I hope he was being straight with me because what he said was very appropriate.
0926	TRUMP	Im the frontrunner by a lot.
0927	TRUMP	Im beating Ted Cruz by millions of votes.
0928	TRUMP	Millions of votes.
0929	TRUMP	The Republican Party is doing  its a phenomena.
0930	TRUMP	And this was not going to that with the Republican Party.
0931	TRUMP	People that never voted before, Democrats and independents, are pouring in and voting for me.
0932	COOPER	In Louisiana, you won
0933	TRUMP	I won.
0934	COOPER	But Ted Cruz got
0935	TRUMP	To show you how corrupt the system is
0936	COOPER	 got more delegates.
0937	COOPER	You threatened to sue.
0938	TRUMP	I won  well, Im going to see.
0939	TRUMP	I mean, I never heard of that before.
0940	TRUMP	You know, Im a very  Im an American.
0941	TRUMP	If you win an election, youre supposed to
0942	COOPER	But isnt that just sour grapes?
0943	COOPER	Didnt he just have
0944	TRUMP	No.
0945	COOPER	He just outworked you on the ground in getting delegates?
0946	TRUMP	No.
0947	TRUMP	Now let me tell you whats next.
0948	TRUMP	No, no.
0949	TRUMP	Look, in Missouri, I just  it was just announced I won.
0950	TRUMP	I figured, in fact, they actually found that after a tabulation that I got 300 and some odd more votes than I had the first time, which is, you know, after two weeks or three weeks of tabulation, which gives me another 12 or 13 delegates.
0951	TRUMP	It was just announced a little while ago just before I went on the air.
0952	TRUMP	I will say this, Louisiana, I went to Louisiana.
0953	TRUMP	I have a great relationship with the people of Louisiana.
0954	TRUMP	Theyre great people.
0955	TRUMP	I won the election.
0956	TRUMP	I was down there the night before.
0957	TRUMP	We had an airplane hangar, you wouldnt believe it, packed with people screaming.
0958	TRUMP	I won the election.
0959	TRUMP	And then its all about the delegates.
0960	TRUMP	So I won.
0961	TRUMP	And then I found out that I got 10 votes less  10 delegates less than the guy who lost.
0962	TRUMP	I beat him rather easily.
0963	COOPER	But those are the rules.
0964	COOPER	I mean, his campaign had a better ground game in Louisiana.
0965	TRUMP	No, I dont know what rules  OK, I dont know, I dont think  I dont call it a ground game.
0966	TRUMP	I call it bad politics.
0967	COOPER	They were able to get more delegates.
0968	TRUMP	I call it bad politics.
0969	TRUMP	When somebody goes in and wins the election and gets less delegates than the guy that lost, I dont think thats right.
0970	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0971	COOPER	All right.
0972	COOPER	I want you to meet Jim Zaiser, hes the CEO of a valve manufacturing company that has been in the family for three generations.
0973	COOPER	He says hes undecided.
0974	COOPER	Hes leaning in your favor.
0975	TRUMP	Thank you.
0976	TRUMP	Thats what I like to hear.
0977	QUESTION	Hello, Mr. Trump.
0978	QUESTION	As a world leader, any leader, you need compassion and a willingness to make compromises.
0979	QUESTION	Can you give me an example of a time you have learned from your behavior and changed the way you have done something going forward?
0980	TRUMP	Yes.
0981	TRUMP	I am somebody  Jim, thank you.
0982	TRUMP	I am somebody that believes in flexibility.
0983	TRUMP	And if you notice, Ted Cruz and mostly him, he says he will change, he will negotiate, he will this.
0984	TRUMP	Look, you dont have to stand on the floor of the United States Senate for a dayandahalf and rant and rave while all the other senators are laughing at you, and by the way, not endorsing him.
0985	TRUMP	Senator Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected men in the Senate, endorsed me, and frankly  I mean, and hes a great man.
0986	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0987	TRUMP	And by the way, Jeff Sessions is a great man with great, great knowledge.
0988	TRUMP	And Ted Cruz thought he was going to get that endorsement.
0989	TRUMP	He would speak about Jeff Sessions all the time, then Jeff Sessions came out and endorsed me.
0990	TRUMP	You need flexibility, and I talk about it all the time.
0991	TRUMP	You need to be able to negotiate great deals.
0992	TRUMP	You know, its not all about signing executive orders because this is something that came in  that wasnt the way our founders thought that this country was going to win.
0993	TRUMP	You have to get  now, Ill make great deals.
0994	TRUMP	Ill make conservative deals.
0995	TRUMP	Im going to make wonderful deals but you have to do it the oldfashioned way like Ronald Reagan did with Tip ONeill.
0996	COOPER	Do you have a specific, though, for him on  a specific example that you changed your behavior, changed the way youve done something going forward, or learned from something youve done that you didnt like the way it turned out?
0997	TRUMP	Well, I think  yeah, I mean, I have many, many things that Ive done.
0998	TRUMP	I have many things that Ive changed course on.
0999	TRUMP	I mean, Ive changed course on many, many things.
1000	TRUMP	I was not
1001	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1002	TRUMP	Actually, I have.
1003	COOPER	Any specifics?
1004	TRUMP	Well, I mean, you could say, I am  as you know, Im prolife, and I was originally prochoice.
1005	TRUMP	I will say this, that as a developer and as a businessman Im not sure I was ever even asked the question, are you prolife, prochoice?
1006	TRUMP	And it was not something that as one of magazines recently said, Donald Trump is a worldclass businessman.
1007	TRUMP	He was never asked those questions before.
1008	TRUMP	But you know, if I was asked those questions years ago its something I never really gave much though to.
1009	TRUMP	But Ive made certain changes.
1010	TRUMP	I have evolved.
1011	TRUMP	I talk about evolving all the time.
1012	COOPER	I want to
1013	TRUMP	And by the way, you know who else evolved, is Ronald Reagan evolved.
1014	TRUMP	Because Ronald Reagan signed one of the toughest abortion laws in favor of abortion in California that had been signed in many, many years.
1015	TRUMP	And yet has a great president and a  pretty conservative  he wasnt very conservative, but he was a pretty conservative president.
1016	COOPER	You said on the radio right here in Wisconsin the other day that you do apologize and you believe in apologizing.
1017	COOPER	When was the last time you actually apologized for something?
1018	TRUMP	Oh, wow.
1019	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1020	TRUMP	No, I do  I dont know  Ill think.
1021	TRUMP	Can I think?
1022	TRUMP	But look, I do believe in apologizing, if youre wrong.
1023	TRUMP	But if youre not wrong, I dont believe in apologizing.
1024	TRUMP	For instance, I could have apologized, you brought up  we started this with Corey, my campaign manager.
1025	TRUMP	Will you apologize.
1026	TRUMP	I said, apologize for what?
1027	TRUMP	I see the tape.
1028	TRUMP	Apologize for what?
1029	TRUMP	Ive love to apologize.
1030	TRUMP	It would be so much easier.
1031	TRUMP	Apologize, Corey, youre fired
1032	COOPER	But you dont know any specific examples that youve apologized, ever.
1033	TRUMP	Yes, I mean  apologized  I apologized to my mother years ago for using foul language.
1034	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1035	TRUMP	I apologize to my wife for not being presidential on occasion.
1036	TRUMP	Shes always saying Darling, be more presidential.
1037	COOPER	She told me shes talked to you about that.
1038	TRUMP	No, she does, because she thinks Im very presidential.
1039	TRUMP	The last debate  and by the way, Cruz talked about I dont want to  I debated this guy like 112 (ph) times.
1040	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1041	COOPER	She didnt like you reusing the word, a dirty word, or a bad word I guess  I sound like a 12yearold
1042	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1043	COOPER	 that somebody in your audience shouted out and you repeated.
1044	COOPER	She didnt like that.
1045	TRUMP	Oh, she didnt like that.
1046	TRUMP	And really, it was just a repeat, but that didnt work out too well.
1047	TRUMP	No, she didnt
1048	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1049	TRUMP	Repeats dont work either.
1050	TRUMP	And it wasnt horrible.
1051	COOPER	What is it with you, like, repeats and retweets dont count.
1052	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1053	TRUMP	Do you ever notice my biggest problems are repeats and retweets.
1054	TRUMP	I dont in problem with what I say its when I repeat such
1055	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1056	COOPER	Well, maybe thats one of those things you should learn from your behavior and not retweet things.
1057	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1058	TRUMP	Youre right.
1059	TRUMP	Youre right.
1060	TRUMP	That I agree with.
1061	COOPER	Some free advice.
1062	TRUMP	That I agree with.
1063	TRUMP	I will say this, though, my wife and Ivanka said, like, on the last debates, because the debates had been pretty rough and really I felt I had to be rough, because its coming at me from all different angles.
1064	TRUMP	Dont forget Ive been at the middle of the podium, the middle of the stage for every single debate.
1065	TRUMP	Ive enjoyed debate  I never debated
1066	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1067	COOPER	Cruz has challenged you to debate him.
1068	TRUMP	Give me a break.
1069	TRUMP	The guy has challenged me  hes lost every debate.
1070	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1071	COOPER	You wouldnt debate him one on one?
1072	TRUMP	I think weve had enough questions from the same people, including you  and all due respect.
1073	COOPER	I havent done a GOP debate yet, but thats all right.
1074	TRUMP	How many times can the same people  how many times, Anderson, can the same people ask the same question?
1075	TRUMP	Its just  you get tired of it.
1076	COOPER	But as president youre going to be asked the same question for four or eight years.
1077	TRUMP	Ive had 11 or 12 debates  wait a minute  Ive had 11 or 12 debates with Cruz.
1078	TRUMP	Every  Drudge, they do an online poll right after the debate, Time magazine, Slate, many groups do  I think Ive won every single poll by a lot on debating.
1079	TRUMP	I have nothing to prove anymore.
1080	COOPER	So no more debates?
1081	TRUMP	I dont see where its necessary.
1082	TRUMP	I mean, look, youre asking me all of these questions tonight.
1083	TRUMP	Frankly, I think this is much better than a debate.
1084	TRUMP	The debates, they give you 15 seconds, what would you do in terms of war and peace, okay?
1085	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1086	TRUMP	Honestly, i Think this is a much better format.
1087	COOPER	Im happy to keep having these conversations.
1088	TRUMP	I dont think its easier.
1089	TRUMP	I think debating is probably easier because youre talking so little.
1090	COOPER	I want to bring in.
1091	COOPER	Sorry
1092	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1093	TRUMP	So I hope you change your mind.
1094	TRUMP	I hope youre can agree (ph) with me.
1095	COOPER	Sorry, hold on.
1096	COOPER	Sorry, John.
1097	COOPER	I want you to meet John Peghill (ph).
1098	COOPER	Thanks very much.
1099	TRUMP	Yes, hi, John.
1100	COOPER	Hes a dairy farmer.
1101	COOPER	Hes got 5,000 cows.
1102	COOPER	We have another dairy farmer asking a question for Senator Cruz earlier.
1103	COOPER	John said hes leaning in your favor.
1104	COOPER	Still listening to the other candidates.
1105	COOPER	John, welcome.
1106	TRUMP	Hi, John.
1107	QUESTION	Mr. Trump  hi.
1108	QUESTION	Welcome to the Cheese State.
1109	TRUMP	Thank you.
1110	TRUMP	A great state.
1111	COOPER	The question that I have  Wisconsin is an amazing state.
1112	COOPER	But our No.
1113	COOPER	1 economic driver, which is the dairy industry and the cheese industry is right behind it, is being challenged right now by having a labor force dependent on an immigration policy.
1114	COOPER	And weve got over 10,000 farms in this state.
1115	COOPER	And with there being such a strong economic driver, if we dont have a strong immigration policy that will give us the opportunity to keep the ones that we have and provide a vehicle to bring new ones in from Mexico legally
1116	TRUMP	Legally.
1117	TRUMP	You said the word.
1118	COOPER	Yes, but can you develop a policy that will give us that, give us the people that we have here to stay here and do the jobs  and create a policy that can bring people in to fill the jobs?
1119	COOPER	Were down to 3.5 percent unemployment rate North of Milwaukee, so that we cant steal any more people from someone elses industry, because thats what everybodys doing at this point.
1120	COOPER	How do we fill the jobs, the good paying jobs?
1121	COOPER	How do we fill those jobs?
1122	TRUMP	Heres where you are, youre in the same position as the California grape growers because they need people to come in.
1123	TRUMP	Its seasonal, in that case.
1124	TRUMP	Very seasonal, less seasonal in your case, but still seasonal.
1125	TRUMP	And, people will be able  if they cant get people, will be able to come in legally.
1126	TRUMP	See, you said the word.
1127	TRUMP	Right now we have illegal immigration, we have illegals all over the country.
1128	TRUMP	We have at least 11 million.
1129	TRUMP	Some people think it could be 31 million, its somewhere in between.
1130	TRUMP	Its probably 12, 13, 14  we have no idea what were doing.
1131	TRUMP	If you have an industry like California grapes, like perhaps what youre talking about in Wisconsin, were going to let people come in, but theyre going to come in legally.
1132	TRUMP	Theyre going to come in through a visa program and theyre going to come in legally.
1133	TRUMP	Its going to work out beautifully, you will not be affected.
1134	TRUMP	We dont want to affect businesses.
1135	TRUMP	We want to grow businesses.
1136	TRUMP	The other part of your question now, I think that we really have to talk about, is trade because a lot of people are sending goods over to other countries, and especially goods that can spoil like what you do.
1137	TRUMP	They send over to other countries, and the other country refuse to accept them, and yet we accept their good without tax, without anything.
1138	TRUMP	We are going to straighten out our trade policy so that youre going to get a lot more business.
1139	COOPER	We have time for one more question from the audience.
1140	COOPER	This is Andy Bowen, shes from Shorewood, and homeschools her two daughters.
1141	COOPER	She says shes leaning in your favor for the primary next week.
1142	COOPER	Andy, welcome.
1143	TRUMP	Thank you.
1144	TRUMP	Hi, Andy.
1145	QUESTION	Thank you, hi, Mr. Trump.
1146	QUESTION	My 93yearold father is so impressed with all of your kids.
1147	TRUMP	Thats good.
1148	QUESTION	Especially with your two sons.
1149	QUESTION	And, when theyre on television being interviewed, he will often say, Why cant Donald Trump be more like his sons, who are so
1150	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1151	TRUMP	 I hear that.
1152	TRUMP	I know.
1153	QUESTION	 who are so well spoken, and calm.
1154	QUESTION	And, so my question to you, Mr. Trump, is could you possibly look to your sons as examples how not to be quite so reactionary?
1155	QUESTION	And, also, congratulations on raising such fine young people
1156	TRUMP	Thank you very much.
1157	TRUMP	I think I love that question, can I be honest?
1158	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1159	TRUMP	I have so many compliments on my children, and Ivanka is doing phenomenally well.
1160	TRUMP	My boys are great Baron is a young version, I think, of Eric, frankly, because theyre very tall, and they look alike, etcetera, etcetera.
1161	TRUMP	But, Don, and Eric, and Baron are just spectacular people, and you know?
1162	TRUMP	I get so many compliments.
1163	TRUMP	Ivanka, is Ivanka, you know?
1164	TRUMP	You know Ivanka very well, youve had her on your show, and shes a star.
1165	TRUMP	Shes absolutely a start, and so supportive of me, and so supportive what Im doing.
1166	TRUMP	And, they do have great attitude.
1167	TRUMP	I do, I get so many people come up to my office, and they want to have their children come up and meet me because they want their children to be like mine.
1168	COOPER	Do you sometimes wish you had a little bit more of what she called, calmness?
1169	TRUMP	My children have a lot of drive.
1170	TRUMP	You dont want to see them sometimes, I will say this.
1171	TRUMP	Theyre very strong.
1172	TRUMP	They are very  they have great heart.
1173	TRUMP	They have great heart.
1174	TRUMP	All of my children have a wonderful, wonderful feeling for people, they love people.
1175	TRUMP	Thats why they want me to do what Im doing, because they know Id do it well.
1176	TRUMP	They know Ill bring the country  you know, we have the expression, Make America Great Again.
1177	TRUMP	They know I will make America Great again.
1178	TRUMP	The world isnt going to take advantages of us anymore.
1179	TRUMP	You look at what the world is doing to us at every level, whether its militarily, or in trade, or in so many other levels, the world is taking advantage of the United States and its driving us into literally being a third world nation.
1180	TRUMP	Anderson, I travel all over the world, and I land at airports the likes of which youve never seen, whether its in Qatar, or Dubai, or places in China.
1181	TRUMP	The likes of which you have never seen, and then we come home and we land at LaGuardia with potholes all over the place, or LAX, or Kennedy, or Newark, and you look at what we have and where weve gone.
1182	TRUMP	Its time to rebuild our country.
1183	COOPER	You just welcomed a new grandson
1184	TRUMP	 And I really appreciate your statement.
1185	TRUMP	Thank you.
1186	COOPER	You just welcomed a new grandson
1187	TRUMP	I did.
1188	COOPER	His name is Theodore.
1189	COOPER	Any chance youre going to call him Crying Ted?
1190	TRUMP	No, I dont think so.
1191	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1192	TRUMP	I said  well, actually, isnt Teds real name Raphael?
1193	TRUMP	I think so, right?
1194	TRUMP	Because that was one of the questions did have to ask.
1195	COOPER	I  it is.
1196	TRUMP	I doesnt matter.
1197	TRUMP	Theodore Roosevelt is somebody Jared and Ivanka have long studied and respected, and its Theodore James.
1198	TRUMP	Tough, strong, and its Theodore James, and thats what they really had in mind.
1199	COOPER	Congratulations on that, and god bless.
1200	TRUMP	Thank you, really appreciate that.
1201	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
