Bush unsuccessfully proposed a plan to quasi-privatize the entitlement program for younger workers.\nMany Republicans (not just Heck and Bush) have supported adding optional private accounts for younger workers as a way to extend the life of the entitlement program, which is scheduled to run out of reserve funds in 2034 and be unable to pay out full benefits to future beneficiaries.\nHere\u2019s what Heck has actually proposed or has mentioned as a potential change for the entitlement program:\n\n\nIndexing the retirement age from 67 to 69 by one month per year for the next 24 years;\n\n\nAllowing younger workers to voluntarily invest retirement funds directed toward Social Security into other private markets;\n\n\nPossibly raising the cap on earnings to which the Social Security tax applies ($118,500 in 2015).\n\n\nIt\u2019s that second point that AFSCME says backs up the claim that Heck wants to \"privatize\" Social Security. (Heck calls it a \"diversified investment.\")\nThis is somewhat of an argument over semantics: Is Heck\u2019s proposal privatization or not? PolitiFact has generally found that support for voluntary private Social Security accounts for younger workers doesn\u2019t merit the sort of concerns or consequences implied by a \"full privatization\" of the program.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry Reid\n\n\nstated on July 27, 2016 in a speech at the DNC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays \"Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to gamble with your retirement benefits in the stock market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Riley Snyder \u2022 July 27, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of Republicans, including Heck, say they\u2019re adamantly opposed to making any changes that would affect those already receiving benefits or about to enter the program. It\u2019s misleading of the ad to suggest that Nevada senior citizens could lose \"our savings\" given that Heck has never called for changes to be made for current beneficiaries.\nAFSCME did point to several reports on the potential fiscal cost of a quasi-privatized option, most of which were published nearly a decade ago when the Bush administration was pushing for changes to the entitlement program. Heck was elected to Congress in 2010.\nAs the ad points out, Bush\u2019s plan to shift to a partially privatized version of Social Security would likely lead to billions of dollars in fees for the brokerages and mutual fund businesses who would oversee the new individual accounts.\nHeck has previously said he\u2019s more concerned about securing retirement for individuals than ensuring the future solvency of the program.\n\"It\u2019s not about making Social Security solvent,\" Heck said to the Las Vegas Sun in 2010. \"It\u2019s about securing people\u2019s retirement.\"\nIn 2011, Heck did join House Republicans in a vote against an amendment that would have prohibited the use of appropriated funds to cut or \"privatize\" Social Security and other entitlements.\nHeck campaign spokesman Brian Baluta said in an email that private investments could potentially entail anything from U.S. Treasury securities, annuities, CDs, money market funds, interest-bearing savings accounts or employer-matched retirement savings account.\n\"But all this is moot, because it\u2019s a theoretical discussion about how to address the long-range insolvency of (Social Security),\" Baluta said in an email. \"There is no Joe Heck plan to privatize Social Security.\"\nThis isn\u2019t the first time AFSCME has gone after Heck on this particular issue \u2014 the union was sharply criticized over a similar ad in 2010 by journalists including Jon Ralston, who accused the union of \"blatant fear mongering.\"\nOur ruling\nA new AFSCME ad claims that Heck \"supports privatizing (Social Security), turning our savings over to Wall Street, and risking it on the stock market.\"\nHeck has stated an openness to supporting optional, private retirement accounts for people under a certain age as an alternative to the existing Social Security program, but AFSCME is bending the truth.\nDespite what the ad implies, Heck has never suggested a mandatory privatization of the entitlement system that would forcibly \"turn our savings over to Wall Street.\"\nBecause this ad is partially accurate but takes things way out of context, we rate it Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2e5621fe-e15c-4d76-97bf-10e670c5c320", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04477"}
