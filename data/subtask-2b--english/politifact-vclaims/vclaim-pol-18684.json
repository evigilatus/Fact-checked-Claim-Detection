I want you all to know something...if you are checking in at the polls and they happen to write anything on your ballot before they give it to you to put in the voting machine...a letter, a checkmark, a star, an R or a D any writing of any kind...please request a new ballot. Your ballot could be disqualified if it is written on. Please be on the lookout for this type of behavior.\"\u00a0\nThis information is incorrect and this post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Texas law requires poll workers to sign the back of voters\u2019 ballots to guarantee their authenticity. They may physically sign it or they might stamp it, he said. During early voting in Tarrant County, for example, Garcia may sign the ballots himself or poll workers may use a stamp with Garcia\u2019s initials on the back of it to authenticate ballots. On Election Day, election judges at every precinct will either sign ballots or use a stamp with their signature, he said.\nNeither the stamp or the signature \u2014 or just an errant marking on the ballot \u2014 will disqualify it, Garcia said. \"Don\u2019t get confused \u2014 poll workers have to do this.\"\u00a0\nIt seems that the message in this Facebook post is being copied and pasted in communities around the country. On Oct. 9, Lead Stories fact-checked a nearly identical post in Myrtle Beach, S.C.\u00a0\nThere, an election official said, poll workers don\u2019t have a reason to write on a ballot, but it wouldn\u2019t be disqualified if they did.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18684"}
