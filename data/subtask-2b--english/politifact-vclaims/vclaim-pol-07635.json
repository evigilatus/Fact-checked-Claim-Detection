After liberal radio host Stephanie Miller claimed, \"President Bush had way more executive orders than President Obama\" (a topic we have tackled in previous fact-checks), Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer said Obama\u2019s actions are \"fundamentally different than has ever happened before.\" Proof? How about his recent record with the Supreme Court.\n\"In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders,\" Spicer said.\nThis was a bit of deja vu for us. Just one week earlier on another Sunday political show, Fox News Sunday, we heard a very similar claim from Rep. Bob Goodlatte. We rated it False.\nGoodlatte claimed that the Supreme Court decision in National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning was \"the 13th time the Supreme Court has voted 9-0 that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority.\"\nSpicer\u2019s statement relies on the same incorrect premise as Goodlatte\u2019s comment, and in fact takes it a step further. (In an email to PolitiFact, he also admitted that he \"misspoke in using the statistic.\") Let's explain why.\nGoodlatte provided us a list of the cases he was referring to. We reviewed them, and enlisted the help of constitutional law experts to take a look as well.\nWe had several issues with the list. For starters, nine of the 13 cases actually originated when President George W. Bush was in office.\nBush\u2019s Justice Department handled the initial court proceedings in most of those instances.\nObama\u2019s Justice Department in many of the cases handled the appellate process and ultimately defended the actions to the Supreme Court. But that\u2019s commonplace, experts we spoke with said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly one of the 13 cases actually had to do directly with Obama\u2019s overreach: National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning. In that case, decided in June, the Supreme Court said unanimously that Obama went too far when he appointed members to the National Labor Relations Board when the Senate wasn\u2019t technically in session.\nBut even that case had nothing to do with what Spicer said last weekend on CNN. Spicer claimed that the court has unanimously rejected \"the president's executive orders\" 13 times in three years.\nExecutive orders are a lot different, and a lot more specific, than \"constitutional authority,\" which is what Goodlatte said. Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope.\nIt does not appear that any of these cases actually have to do with executive orders issued by Obama.\nIn the case concerning the National Labor Relations Board, for example, the issue was the president\u2019s power to make appointments. There was no executive order issued that named individuals to positions to the board.\nIn United States vs. Arizona, another case on the list, Obama\u2019s justice department took Arizona to court over the state\u2019s tough immigration laws. But it wasn\u2019t the result of an executive order from Obama.\nIn one of the cases, McCullen vs. Coakley, the Obama administration was not even a plaintiff or a defendant in the case. The case was a challenge to a Massachusetts law that put no-protest zones around abortion clinics. While the Obama administration filed a brief supporting the Massachusetts law, no executive order was filed or challenged.\nAnd again, most of these cases were started under Bush, so any executive action was likely coming from the previous administration, not Obama.\nOur ruling\nSpicer said, \"In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders.\"\nMost of the litigation actually came in response to actions under the Bush administration. In the few cases initiated during Obama\u2019s two terms, the court wasn't even ruling on challenges to Obama\u2019s executive orders.\nSpicer took an already debunked argument and made another mistake in repeating it, so it was even more incorrect.
