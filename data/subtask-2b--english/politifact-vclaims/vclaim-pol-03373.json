One way could be with savings from money that\u2019s inappropriately going to immigrants, he said.\nSessions talked about paying for the wall on ABC\u2019s This Week after host George Stephanopoulos asked if Mexico would pay for the wall, as Trump has promised.\n\"Well, we're going to get paid for it one way or the other. I know there's $4 billion a year in excess payments, according to the Department of the Treasury's own inspector general several years ago, that are going to payments to people -- tax credits that they shouldn't get,\" Sessions said April 23. \"These are mostly Mexicans. And those kind of things add up -- $4 billion a year for 10 years is $40 billion. There are a lot of ways we can find money to help pay for this.\"\nSessions left us wondering if $4 billion a year in tax credits are going to people who are not supposed to get them, and if they are mostly Mexicans. There\u2019s some truth to Sessions\u2019 claim, but it also leaves out some critical details.\nTreasury Department report\nAnyone who earns an income in the United States is required to pay taxes, whether they live here legally or illegally.\nGenerally, people who are authorized to work in the United States use a Social Security Number to report income and pay taxes on them. Individuals who don\u2019t have employment authorization can file their taxes using a nine-digit Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).\nExperts say the majority of ITIN filers likely are individuals who are living in the country illegally, but an ITIN can also be issued to people here legally, such as foreign workers.\nThe Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration issued an audit in 2011 that said $4.2 billion in refundable credits were paid to individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States. These funds were claimed in the 2010 tax processing year by a total 2.3 million ITIN filers.\n$4.2 billion tax credits\nThe Treasury audit focused on refunds through the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), available to individuals who owed less in taxes than deductions for the Child Tax Credit (up to $1,000 per child). A child must be a U.S. citizen or resident in order for a parent to claim the credit.\nA law passed in 1996 denied another credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), to individuals who file taxes without a Social Security Number that authorizes employment. ITIN filers are also not eligible for Social Security benefits.\nBut as we\u2019ve reported in a similar claim, Congress has not written a provision barring ITIN filers from claiming the ACTC.\nThe audit cited by Sessions said \"clarification to the law is needed to address whether or not refundable tax credits such as the ACTC may be paid to those who are not authorized to work in the United States.\"\nIn response to a draft of the audit, the Internal Revenue Service said: \"The law does not require the taxpayer or eligible child to have a Social Security number in order to receive the (Child Tax Credit) or the ACTC. The IRS is administering the law accordingly. Legislative changes would be required to deny many of the claims discussed in the report.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the $4.2 billion for processing year 2010, a Congressional Research Service report in 2016 noted that the figure did not necessarily represent the annual revenue losses, since about 11 percent of claimants in 2010 filed tax returns for multiple years.\u00a0\nThe audit said the returns filed for multiple years resulted in claims of more than $1 billion, but not all claims were refunded due to statute of limitations. Point being, the report doesn't show the availability of $4 billion a year, as Sessions said.\nAnd while parents may not be working legally in the United States, in some cases their children are U.S. citizens.\n\"Under what Mr. Sessions is suggesting, it wouldn\u2019t be Mexico that pays for the border wall, but rather low-income children \u2014 most of them U.S. citizens and part of the future U.S. workforce \u2014 and their families,\" said Bob Greenstein, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\u2018Mostly Mexicans\u2019?\nThe 2011 audit did not list nationalities of ITIN filers claiming the credit.\nSessions\u2019 office referred us to a Department of Homeland Security report on the estimates of the unauthorized population as of January 2012, around the time of the audit\u2019s analysis.\nThe DHS report said that of the estimated 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants, 6.7 million were from Mexico.\nWhile the majority of ITIN filers are likely illegally in the country, Greenstein told us there is no data to precisely determine how many Mexican ITIN filers are claiming the ACTC.\nThough a report from the IRS\u2019 Taxpayer Advocate office found that about half of people applying for ITINs in 2014 were Mexican.\nThat report also found that in 2015, 4.4 million ITIN filers paid more than $5.5 billion in payroll and Medicare taxes and $23.6 billion in total taxes.\nOur ruling\nSessions said, the Treasury Department's inspector general found \"there's $4 billion a year in excess payments\" going to people that shouldn\u2019t get them. \"These are mostly Mexicans.\"\nAn audit did find $4.2 billion in refundable credits for child care were paid to individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States. Those\u00a0$4.2 billion were claimed in tax processing year 2010, but\u00a0about 11 percent of claimants in 2010 filed tax returns for multiple years, meaning that amount wouldn't necessarily be available annually.\nSessions says these people \"shouldn\u2019t\" get the tax credit. That may be his opinion, but there\u2019s nothing in the law now saying they can\u2019t claim the credits.\nThe audit didn\u2019t have anything to say about the nationality of those who claimed the credits, though other evidence suggests it\u2019s likely that about half could be Mexican.\nSessions\u2019 statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
