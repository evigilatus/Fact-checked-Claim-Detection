(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nHundreds of people gathered on the White House\u2019s South Lawn on Oct. 10 for an event the Washington Post described as resembling a campaign rally. Trump delivered a short speech and attacked his political opponents, saying \"we\u2019ve got to vote these people into oblivion.\" Attendees wore \"Make America Great Again\" hats and \"BLEXIT\" T-shirts, according to the Post.\u00a0\nThe BLEXIT movement was started by the conservative commentator Candace Owens and encourages Black Americans to leave the Democratic Party.\nABC News reported that some of the event\u2019s guests had their travel and lodging paid for by BLEXIT.\nSupporters were invited by BLEXIT to attend a \"HUGE outdoor rally\" and asked to fill out a form that notified them that the group would cover travel costs, ABC said. Guests were later informed they would receive an invitation from the White House to attend an event with Trump and were required to wear a BLEXIT shirt.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABC said it wasn\u2019t \"immediately clear\" how many people attending the event had their travel costs covered. After Trump\u2019s speech, some BLEXIT attendees marched downtown chanting \"back the blue\" and \"blue lives matter,\" the DCist reported.\u00a0\nIn an Instagram post the week before the event, Owens promoted an \"anti-Black Lives Matter event\" and a \"pro-police event,\" noting that BLEXIT would be giving away a limited number of travel stipends to those that really needed them.\u00a0\nA White House spokesperson told ABC News that the White House wasn\u2019t involved \"in covering any cost.\"\nThe ABC News story doesn\u2019t mention $150 or a nondisclosure agreement.\u00a0\nWe reached out to the national director of BLEXIT to ask about the post but did not immediately receive a reply.\u00a0\nHowever, this Facebook post gives the impression that every person who attended the event at the White House on Oct. 10 was paid $150 and had to sign an NDA. There\u2019s nothing in the ABC News story to support this, and we didn\u2019t find any other news coverage to corroborate this claim.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18667"}
