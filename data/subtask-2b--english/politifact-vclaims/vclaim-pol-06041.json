This goes back to the 14th Amendment.\nOnce Trump raised the issue, other GOP contenders followed suit, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. On Aug. 17, 2015, Jindal tweeted, \"We need to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants.\"\nThis prompted the liberal group Occupy Democrats to post a meme on its Facebook page with this message:\n\" \u2018We have to end birthright citizenship to stop anchor babies,\u2019 says Republican Bobby Jindal whose noncitizen parents arrived in the U.S. four months before he was born and used his birthright citizenship to become Americans, making him an anchor baby.\"\nThe part we\u2019re fact-checking is the claim that Jindal\u2019s parents gained citizenship through him.\nPeople define \"anchor baby\" in different ways. Some use it when food assistance and medical care for a low-income child of undocumented immigrants produce indirect benefits for the parents. That doesn\u2019t apply in Jindal\u2019s case.\nFor one, his parents had healthy incomes when they arrived, and more to the point, Occupy Democrats focused on another meaning of anchor baby \u2014 a child through whom a noncitizen can craft a path to full citizenship.\nComing to America\nThe Facebook post is shaky on its quotation of Jindal. His tweet didn\u2019t mention \"anchor babies.\" The closest he came to saying those words was during an interview with Fox News where, on being pressed by the host, Jindal said, \"I\u2019m happy to use the phrase,\" but he still didn\u2019t actually use it.\nHowever, regarding Jindal\u2019s personal timeline, the post is accurate. Jindal\u2019s parents moved from India to Baton Rouge, La., on Feb. 1, 1971. Jindal was born on June 10, 1971. So that\u2019s just about four months later.\nBack in the days when people like Trump were clamoring for President Barack Obama to show his birth certificate, Jindal moved to ensure that no such questions would hang about him. In 2011, the Times-Picayune reported that Jindal had produced his birth certificate. It showed that he was born at Woman\u2019s Hospital in Baton Rouge to Raj Gupta, his mother, and Amar Jindal, his father.\nAt the time, his mother had a scholarship to study nuclear physics at Louisiana State University, and his father, an engineer professor, was working for a subsidiary of the Kansas City Southern Railway. A couple of years later, Amar Jindal took a new job with the Exxon oil company. Jindal\u2019s mother Raj Gupta earned two master\u2019s degrees, one in physics and another in nuclear engineering. She ultimately worked for the state Labor Department in information technology.\nMike Reed, communications director in the Louisiana governor\u2019s office, told us that Raj Gupta became an American citizen in 1976, and Amar Jindal followed 10 years later in 1986.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does that matter? Because those dates mean that Jindal\u2019s birthright citizenship played no legal role in his parent\u2019s citizenship applications.\nLet\u2019s see why.\n21 is the magic number\nTwo leaders in immigration law explained that Jindal only could have helped his parents become citizens when he had turned 21 years old.\nUnder the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, the child of immigrants can sponsor them to become permanent residents. The child must be a citizen and must be 21 or older. Once the parents are permanent residents, they must live in America for five straight years. After that, they can apply for citizenship.\nIf Jindal\u2019s citizenship had made any difference, the earliest his parents could have been eligible would have been 1992, five years after he turned 21.\nWhen his mother became a citizen in 1976, Jindal was 5, and in 1986, for his father\u2019s naturalization, he was 15. It\u2019s not even close.\n\"If both parents had lawful permanent residence, then it doesn\u2019t make a difference if they had a kid,\" said David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\nLenni Benson, a law professor at New York Law School, also said that given the Jindals\u2019 circumstances, the son\u2019s citizenship was \"irrelevant.\"\n\"Once they secured immigrant visas and became lawful permanent residents, they could seek naturalization on their own after five years of residence and meeting other requirements,\" Benson said.\nEverything Leopold and Benson told us matches the rules that we found on the\u00a0U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website.\nAt the end of the day, there is no evidence that Jindal was an \"anchor baby.\"\nOccupy Democrats did not return a message to the group\u2019s email address.\nOur ruling\nOccupy Democrats said Bobby Jindal\u2019s parents used his birthright citizenship to become Americans. We reviewed the law and spoke to two experts in immigration law. The only way Jindal might have been able to help his parents become citizens is if he had been 21. He was 5 when his mother became a citizen and 15 when his father took the same step.\nThe experts we reached told us Jindal\u2019s citizenship was irrelevant, bringing Occupy Democrats' claim into the realm of ridiculous.\u00a0We rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06041"}
