Research into promoting clean energy development is critical to national security in America and creates jobs. Our country spends more on potato chips than on all energy research and development activities; less than 1.2 per cent of energy expenditure compared with nearly 15 per cent in research and development with pharmaceuticals. But is that true? We've had a good look. McKinley's office didn't respond to any investigation. We have discovered, by mating or non-coupling, that the comparison has been widespread for nearly a decade and is reflected in a report issued in 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences. According to the report, \"consumers in the United States spend much more on potato chips than the government devotes to energy research and development.\" It cited the 2009 United States potato chip sales figure of $7.1 billion, and the Federal Government &apos; s total expenditure on energy research and development amounted to $5.1 billion. On January 17, 2021, President Donald Trump stated in an interview with Fox News that he \"cannot say anything (about the riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms removed it.\" For the sale of potato chips, we've located a study site by the market research publisher the set of facts that linked the sale of potato chips in the United States in 2015 to $7.5 billion. With regard to research funding, the amount allocated to the United States Department of Energy Science Office in fiscal year 2018 was $5.4 billion. Not all of this was specifically for energy research, but some went to nuclear physics and computing technology. So the sales of potato chips in the U.S. are still almost beyond what the federal government spends on energy research. The Governor McKinley wrote on Twitter \"Our country spends more on potato chips than we spend on energy research and development.\" This nearly a decade-long comparison still exists today. We're assessing it right.
