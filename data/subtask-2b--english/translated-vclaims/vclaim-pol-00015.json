The vote is scheduled to end on Friday. The demands of the Confederation &apos; s workers are centred on health-care benefits, better wages and occupational protection. Some of the terms of the deal for hourly workers include an increase in wages of 3 per cent in the second and fourth year with the company, $60,000 in remuneration for 2,000 qualified producers, 60 skilled workers to be retired, and protection in time of leave. Part of the argument put forward by local union president Glen Cage in 2250 was that the consortium helped the GM to remain financially stable over the past decade. 2250 is the UAW chapter of Witzville, the Missouri GM factory that manufactures large trucks. \"General Motors makes record profits,\" Cage said in an interview on 16 September with The Missouri Times, \"and they can't do it without hard work for our members who have earned wage increases, earned better benefits, earned our temporary workers to turn them into permanent workers, and gained job protection.\" Whether the GM makes record profits depends on the time period. My first question is, when? Because, as an accounting concept, profits are measured over a period of time, such as a quarter or a year. So when someone just says to record the profits, they leave something (outside), Tim Howold, an assistant professor of accounting and finance at Missouri University. In 2014, quarterly GM profits were moving in a steady upward trend, eventually leading to a record year in 2015. According to the deposits of the GM Securities and Exchange Commission, the GM &apos; s income was $9.7 billion in 2015, up from $2.8 billion in 2014. This increase stabilized in 2016, when revenues amounted to $9.4 billion. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 20 January 2021, the increase in profits in 2015 can be attributed, in part, to the increased demand for high margin pick-up trucks and utility vehicles. These vehicles are specialized in so-called three large manufacturers in Detroit, namely GM, Ford and Viat Chrysler. They're famous at the time of \"We sell the most expensive cars we have at all,\" as Bernard Soysky, the director of the Car Community Partnership at the Car Research Center said. \"Then inside that is moving towards trucks and also passing vehicles, which are cars that look like trucks,\" he said. 'Cause it's more profitable than cars, and this leads to higher profits for all car manufacturers, but for three Detroit in particular, because they control the minivans.' Part of the increase in profits also led to a strike. Soysky said, \"He had about a million units of unused car capacity.\" \"This brings us back to why they made money -- the market moved to trucks and that's good, somehow, because you get more profitable GM. But (it's bad) if you happen to be a GM manufacturer who's at the sedan factory.\" In comparison, in 2017, the company lost $3.9 billion. This is partly due to amendments to new tax laws. The GM recovered in 2018 with a net income of $7.9 billion, but that was not a record record. Our referee, Cage, said, \"General Motors makes record profits.\" According to GM files, the GM achieved record profits in 2015, but not in the last two years, when GM profits were already declining. Although the profits of recent years are higher than in the early to mid-2010 period, they are still not regarded as a record setting. With that data, we value this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00015"}
