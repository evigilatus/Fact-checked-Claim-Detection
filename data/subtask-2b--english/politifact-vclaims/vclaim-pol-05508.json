What he proposes in lieu of reparations \u2014 job creation, investment in cities, and free higher education \u2014 is well within the Overton window, and his platform on race echoes Democratic orthodoxy.\"\nMeet the Press host Chuck Todd followed up with Sanders about Coates\u2019 column Jan. 24, asking, \"Why aren't you for reparations because of slavery for African-Americans when you're calling for economic justice on so many other levels? Why do you stop short on that issue?\"\n\"Well, for the same reason that Barack Obama has and the same reason, I believe, that Hillary Clinton has,\" Sanders responded. \"And that is, it is absolutely wrong and unacceptable that we have so much poverty in this country and it is even worse in the African-American community.\"\nTodd chided Sanders for not answering the question, but Sanders again deflected that it was for the same reasons as Obama and Clinton.\nIs it true that his position against reparations is the same as Clinton and Obama\u2019s views?\nSanders is right that Obama\u2019s opposition echoes his own. (Coates calls this the conventional Democratic philosophy of \"a rising tide lifts all boats.\")\u00a0Clinton\u2019s stance is less direct but largely follows the same rationale.\nSanders\u2019 case against reparations\nFirst, let\u2019s explain why Sanders is opposed to reparations for African-Americans.\nWhen first asked about the issue by Fusion at the Jan. 11\u00a0Iowa Brown & Black Democratic Forum, Sanders stressed the political impracticability and polarizing nature of the proposal, and suggested prioritizing current economic inequality in lieu of compensating for past injustices.\n\"First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil. Second of all, I think it would be very divisive. The real issue is when we look at the poverty rate among the African-American community, when we look at the high unemployment rate within the African-American community, we have a lot of work to do.\n\"So I think what we should be talking about is making massive investments in rebuilding our cities, in creating millions of decent paying jobs, in making public colleges and universities tuition-free, basically targeting our federal resources to the areas where it is needed the most, and where it is needed the most is in impoverished communities, often African-American and Latino.\"\nOn Meet the Press, Sanders pretty much dropped the pragmatism argument (though he pushed back on the notion that his economic proposals are politically impossible) and focused instead on the second part of his rationale about improving economic conditions and schools for minorities.\nSo how does this mirror, if at all, the approach by Obama and Clinton?\nObama\u2019s opposition\nIn 2007 and 2008, then-presidential candidate Obama voiced his opposition to reparations, arguing that the best way to amend for the past is to focus on the present and future.\n\"I think the reparations we need right here in South Carolina is investment, for example, in our schools,\" Obama said in a July 2007 CNN debate.\nObama couched his opposition somewhat differently in a 2007 NAACP presidential questionnaire. He said that \"nothing, including reparations, can fully compensate\" for the stain of slavery before arguing that reparations could lead to negligence on other matters of racial injustices:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say 'we\u2019ve paid our debt'\u00a0and to avoid the much harder work of enforcing our anti-discrimination laws in employment and housing; the much harder work of making sure that our schools are not separate and unequal; the much harder work of providing job training programs and rehabilitating young men coming out of prison every year; and the much harder work of lifting 37 million Americans of all races out of poverty.\n\"These challenges will not go away with reparations. So while I applaud and agree with the underlying sentiment of recognizing the continued legacy of slavery, I would prefer to focus on the issues that will directly address these problems \u2013 and building a consensus to do just that.\"\nObama explains he will not pursue reparations because the action could be used as an excuse not to work on other lingering problems for minorities. Here, Obama\u2019s comments sound different from Sanders\u2019.\nSanders and Obama sound more aligned in these comments by Obama from July 2008, which both Obama and the Sanders campaign pointed out: \u00a0\n\"You know, I have said in the past \u2014 and I'll repeat again \u2014 that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed.\n\"And, you know, I think that strategies that invest in lifting people out of the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, but that have broad applicability and allow us to build coalitions to actually get these things done, that, I think, is the best strategy.\n\"You know, the fact is, is that dealing with some of the \u2014 some of the legacy of discrimination is going to cost billions of dollars. And we're not going to be able to have that kind of resource allocation unless all Americans feel that they are invested in making this stuff happen.\n\"And so, you know, I'm much more interested in talking about, how do we get every child to learn? How do we get every person health care? How do we make sure that everybody has a job? How do we make sure that every senior citizen can retire with dignity and respect?\n\"And if we have a program, for example, of universal health care, that will disproportionately affect people of color, because they're disproportionately uninsured. If we've got an agenda that says every child in America should get -- should be able to go to college, regardless of income, that will disproportionately affect people of color, because it's oftentimes our children who can't afford to go to college.\"\nObama, as far as we can tell through searching Nexis, has not changed or revisited his stance on reparations since 2008. \u00a0\nClinton\u2019s position\nClinton\u2019s recent and past comments suggest her ideas for helping the black community are no different from Sanders\u2019 and Obama\u2019s.\nClinton didn\u2019t directly answer the question about reparations at the Iowa Brown & Black Forum, but she also suggested investing in black communities and addressing poverty:\n\"I think we should start studying what investments we need to make in communities to help individuals and families and communities move forward. And I am absolutely committed to that. There are some good ideas out there. There\u2019s an idea in the Congressional Black Caucus about really targeting federal dollars to communities that have had either disinvestment or no investment, and have had years of being below the poverty level. That\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019d like us to focus on and really help lift people up.\"\nIn October 2015, she provided a similar response when asked by the hosts of the BuzzFeed podcast \"Another Round\":\n\"I\u2019ll tell you what, I think we need to make many more investments in everything from pre-school education to affordable housing, that\u2019s my form of trying to give people the chance to be empowered, to make the most out of their God-given potential.\"\nAs Fusion pointed out, this was largely Clinton\u2019s answer in 2000 as well. When she was asked about reparations during her Senate campaign, she said African-Americans deserve an apology for slavery before pivoting to economic conditions.\n\"But I think that the people I know and the people I work with want us to stay focused on the future, keep our economy going, keep providing good public education, quality affordable health care \u2014 do the things that will enable people to have the best futures for themselves, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m committed to doing.\"\nOur ruling\nSanders said he opposes reparations \"for the same reason that Barack Obama has and the same reason, I believe, that Hillary Clinton has.\"\nThe reason, he said, is the need to focus instead on addressing current economic problems in the black community by improving education, providing jobs and addressing poverty. That is basically what Obama and Clinton has suggested in lieu of reparations.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Sanders previously suggested that reparations were politically impractical and divisive. Obama and Clinton have not made comments to this effect.\u00a0In 2007, Obama said reparations could be used an excuse not to do more for African-Americans.\nWe rate Sanders' claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05508"}
