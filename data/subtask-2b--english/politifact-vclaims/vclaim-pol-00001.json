Eddie Johnson for boycotting his speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police Monday, Trump again repeated a Pants on Fire! claim about the city having the nation\u2019s strictest gun laws, compared violence in Chicago to Afghanistan \u2014 as he has in the past with Baltimore \u2014 and contended reductions in crime here are failing to keep pace with those being made nationally.\n\"Over the last two years, the number of murders in America and America\u2019s major cities has dropped, unlike here, by more than 10%,\" Trump said. \"And if we ever took the Chicago numbers out of our total numbers, the numbers would be incredible \u2014 and they already are, even including Chicago.\"\nNationally, murders have not decreased by quite as much as the president said. What\u2019s more, his Chicago comparison is contradicted by city and federal data. Not only has Chicago seen murders fall by significantly more than 10% in recent years, its decline is rivaled by few other large cities.\nPress officers at the White House did not respond to our request for comment.\nChicago taking a lead, not falling behind\nChicago has seen 27% fewer murders so far this year than it had at this time two years ago, Chicago Police Department data for mid-October show.\nPreliminary federal data for 2019 is not yet available, however, so we compared the latest federal data \u2014 from 2018 \u2014 with figures for 2016. That\u2019s the year Johnson became the city\u2019s top cop. It\u2019s also a year that saw a significant spike in Chicago murders, ending with 765 in all, a total greater than the tallies for New York City and Los Angeles combined.\nThose figures, which are reported by local law enforcement agencies to the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting program, show Trump missed the mark on multiple counts.\nFirst, the number of murders reported nationwide for 2018 was 6.9% lower than it was in 2016 \u2014 not more than 10%, as he claimed.\nSecond, the declines experienced by Chicago during the same period \u2014 from 765 murders to 563 \u2014 were\u00a0larger than those seen in all but three of the nation\u2019s 30 largest cities: San Antonio, San Diego and San Jose.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a turnaround that\u2019s garnered considerable news coverage over the past two years. In 2018, for instance, the Chicago Sun-Times reviewed FBI data for the previous year and found Chicago alone accounted for 86%\u00a0of the net decrease from 2016 in murders nationally.\nThat marked decline is also something Johnson turned to in defense when responding to Trump\u2019s attack.\n\"The president is right about one thing: Violent crime in the United States declined last year for the second consecutive year,\" Johnson said at a news conference Monday. \"But it was Chicago that set the table for those reductions.\"\nAmes Grawert, who leads the quantitative research team at the New York University School of Law\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, said that although Chicago\u2019s per capita murder rate is still more than four times higher than the national average, the city has made considerable progress in recent years \u2014 something Trump\u2019s comments ignore.\n\"He\u2019s dead wrong on Chicago,\" Grawert said. \"The city\u2019s gotten a lot safer in the past two years and it\u2019s not right to say Chicago\u2019s lagging the national trend \u2026 It\u2019s one of the cities that\u2019s led the downward trend of the last two years.\"\nOur ruling\nReferring to Chicago, Trump said that \"over the last two years, the number of murders in America and America\u2019s major cities has dropped, unlike here, by more than 10%.\"\nChicago has seen a nearly 30% decrease in murders over the past several years. That well outpaces the national decline of just under 7%. Rather than holding the nation back, as Trump suggested, Chicago\u2019s progress has contributed to the national decline in violent crime.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00001"}
