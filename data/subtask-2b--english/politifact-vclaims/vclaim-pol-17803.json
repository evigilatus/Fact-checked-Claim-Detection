It originated on a satirical website.\nThat didn\u2019t stop people from sharing it in posts without any disclaimers to indicate it was fabricated.\nOne Twitter user posted the satire story\u2019s headline, \"Tom Brady: \u2018If Anyone on My Team Kneels, I Quit,\u2019\" and then wrote, \"Do you agree with him?\"\nThe phony quote originated on the America\u2019s Last Line of Defense website, which contains a disclaimer that says everything posted on it is fiction.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe site is run by a man named Christopher Blair, who has been publishing fabricated stories for years and says his goal is to trick conservatives into sharing false claims on social media.\nRELATED: If you're fooled by fake news, this man probably wrote it\nBrady, a six-time Super Bowl winner, typically refrains from making public comments on non-football topics, but he told Oprah Winfrey in a June 2018 interview that he respects players who choose to kneel in protest\u00a0during the national anthem before football games.\u00a0\n\n\"I think there were a lot of really good, healthy conversations coming out of it in our locker room,\" Brady said in the interview. \"I respect why people are doing what they\u2019re doing, and they\u2019re doing it for different reasons, and that\u2019s OK. You can do things for your reasons, they can do things for their reasons, and you have respect for that. But I thought it was great.\"\nOur ruling\nPosts claim that Brady said he would quit football if his teammates kneeled during the national anthem.\nHe never said that.
