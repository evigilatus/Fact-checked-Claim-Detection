Ted Lieu, D-Calif., later told CNN anchors John Berman and Poppy Harlow that Trump\u2019s policy will force good people into hiding and prevent them from serving their country.\n\"You've got thousands of people serving in the military who are transgender and they're doing a fantastic job,\" said Lieu, who holds the rank of colonel in the Air Force Reserves.\nLieu repeated the sentiment in a statement he also echoed on his Facebook page and Twitter account.\nWe wondered how many service members identified as transgender, something the U.S. Defense Department didn\u2019t disclose to us. But a couple of estimates show that there are likely thousands of transgender soldiers, sailors and airmen.\nEstimates but no complete data\nTrump\u2019s announcement reversed a policy announced under President Barack Obama in June 2016 that ended the service ban on transgender Americans, which had stayed in place even after Congress repealed the so-called Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell law for gays and lesbians in December 2010.\nTransgender soldiers, airmen and sailors would have faced being medically discharged for disclosing that information, but Obama\u2019s policy allowed those service members to serve openly if they chose. His administration gave the military until July 1, 2017, to fully implement the rule.\nOn June 30, Defense Secretary James Mattis delayed implementation by six months, before Trump appeared to revoke the rule entirely via Twitter.\nAs many as 250 service members have asked to formally change their preferred genders, or have already been approved, the Associated Press has reported.\nThe Defense Department would not elaborate on Trump\u2019s announcement, including how many transgender people served in the military. Reports have said the Pentagon does not keep track of transgender personnel.\nInstead they sent us to the military\u2019s transgender policy web page, which as of this writing had not yet been updated. A Defense Department spokesman said the policy would be revised \"in the near future,\" with White House input. A Trump spokesman did not answer our attempts to contact him.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLieu spokesman Jack d\u2019Annabale said the congressman got his estimate from a May 2014 brief by researchers at UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy.\nThey used responses to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, sent to respondents by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality. The definition of transgender included \"those whose gender identity or expression differs from those traditionally associated with their assigned sex at birth,\" according to the study.\nExtrapolating that 0.3 percent of the population identified as transgender, UCLA\u2019s researchers estimated that there were \"approximately 15,500 transgender individuals are serving on active duty or in the Guard or Reserve forces.\" It also said that about 134,400 transgender people were veterans or retired.\nAnother study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2015 used data from the UCLA brief and other sources to determine that 12,800 service member would be eligible for transgender health care. The study suggested of those, 188 would use benefits for transition services, at a cost of $4.2 million to $5.6 million.\nMore recently, the Pentagon commissioned a June 2016 RAND Corporation report studying the effects of integrating transgender service members. (CNN\u2019s Berman actually mentioned this one during Lieu\u2019s interview.)\nThe think tank estimated that there were between 1,320 and 6,630 active duty transgender personnel, and between 830 and 4,160 in the reserves. The midrange estimates were for 2,450 active duty and 1,510 reserve duty service members.\nAs a side note to Trump\u2019s concern over costs: Only a fraction of active duty transgender service members were likely to seek medical treatment, the study said, resulting in a high-end estimate of an $8.4 million increase in health care costs, or 0.13 percent.\nThe RAND study used the National Transgender Discrimination Survey and other surveys, including private insurance data. RAND started with a lower population prevalence than UCLA did \u2014 0.19 percent instead of 0.3 percent \u2014 accounting for the lower figure.\nIf we combine the top RAND estimates for active duty and reserves, between 2,150 and 10,790 active duty and reserve service members may identify as transgender.\nDefense Department projections for the 2017 fiscal year were for 1.28 million active duty personnel and a little more than 800,000 in the reserves.\nOur ruling\nLieu said, \"You've got thousands of people serving in the military who are transgender and they're doing a fantastic job.\"\nThere are no solid numbers from the Defense Department, but two sources have provided recent estimates extrapolated from survey and insurance data. One 2014 UCLA brief estimated as many as 15,500 active duty and reserve service members may identify as transgender. A 2016 RAND Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon suggested between 2,150 and 10,790 active and reserve duty troops.\nWhile both estimates said there are likely thousands of transgender people in the military, those are still estimates. Lieu should note that in his talking point.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-26 21:45:07 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"You've got thousands of people serving in the military who are transgender.\"    Ted Lieu U.S. Rep., D-Calif.
