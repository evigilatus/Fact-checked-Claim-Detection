Malin directed us to this statement: \"Slightly more than half of the U.S. population experiences poverty at some time before the age of 65.\"\nThat\u2019s very different from what Malin said. Poverty and hunger often correlate. But experts - including the report\u2019s author - underscore that they are not one and the same.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture and many nonprofit or non-governmental organizations\nuse the term \"food insecurity,\" that is, \"people who lack consistent access to adequate food and are unable at times during the year to acquire adequate food because they lack sufficient money or resources.\" Plainly stated: they have difficulty putting food on the table.\nThe USDA defines hunger as a physiological condition \"that might result from food insecurity.\" A government panel has recommended a national assessment of hunger.\nCaroline Ratcliffe, co-author of the Urban Institute Report that Malin cites, said, \"The 50 percent number that he quotes echoes findings in the poverty literature that half of the population will be poor before 65.\"\n\"The percentage of Americans who experience poverty and economic hardship is very high.\nWhat we also know, but isn\u2019t exactly the number he cites, is that people who are poor - a lot of them are food insecure,\" Ratcliffe said.\nThe numbers \"move together, but they are not the same thing,\" Ratcliffe said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also interviewed Alisha J. Coleman-Jensen, PhD, a sociologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service and author of numerous articles and reports on household food insecurity. That includes \"Household Food Security in the United States in 2012.\"\nIn 2012, \"by our estimate, 14.5 percent of households were food insecure,\" she said. That translates to roughly 49 million people in 17.6 million households. Of those, \"5.7 percent of households are at a high risk for food insecurity, meaning they are not getting enough to eat, have disrupted eating patterns or go whole days without food.Those numbers are \"not anywhere near 50 percent.\"\nAs for Malin\u2019s claim, \"I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s from ... I haven\u2019t seen that figure anywhere.\"\nColeman-Jensen wondered aloud if Malin had misinterpreted the close to 50 million people living in food-insecure households as 50 percent.\n\"If they\u2019re talking about somebody going hungry at any point in their lives \u2026 we do not have data that would allow us to measure the percent of people who will experience food insecurity or low food security \u2018at some point in their lives.\u2019\u2019\u2019 She noted that \"our data [are] for a single year.\"\nMark R. Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University, in St. Louis, has conducted research that found that half of all American children will at some point be in a household that uses food stamps. But he said he knew of no studies that addressed lifetime risk of hunger.\n\"One could argue that if you\u2019re using food stamps you\u2019re at risk of experiencing hunger, but that would be as far as one could go,\" Rank said.\nKathleen Gorman, director of the University of Rhode Island\u2019s Feinstein Center for a Hunger-Free America, says she does not find Malin\u2019s statement unreasonable, \"but it is extremely difficult to prove.\" \u00a0\n\"First of all, we do not have any good measures of \u2018hunger\u2019 -- it is a pretty amorphous idea. \u00a0When we measure hunger, we typically use the USDA Household Food Security survey -- and while they are not identical, most people accept that one is an indicator of the other,\" she said. \u00a0\nOur ruling\nAnti-poverty activist Robert Malin said half of all Americans will go hungry at some point in their lives.\nExperts we talked with knew of no research that supported Malin\u2019s claim. And studies show the percentage of Americans facing \"food insecurity\" annually is closer to 15 percent.\nSome studies, however, have found that half of all Americans will be poor at some point in their lives. And researchers say hunger and poverty are linked.\nBecause the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.\n(Correction: Robert Malin is an activist with the Rhode Island Mobilization Against Poverty.
