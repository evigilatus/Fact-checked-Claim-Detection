At the time, Trump was part-owner of the pageant.\nThe next morning, Trump criticized Machado during a Fox and Friends interview. And Trump eventually brought the feud to Twitter.\nIn the second debate on Oct. 9, Cooper cited the tweet in a question about whether Trump has the right temperament to be president.\n\"In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape,\" Cooper said. \"Is that the discipline of a good president?\"\nTrump responded, \"No, it wasn\u2019t saying, \u2018check out a sex tape.\u2019 It was just \u2018take a look at the person she built up to be this wonderful girl scout, who was no girl scout.\u2019 \"\nMaybe that\u2019s what Trump wanted people to read into it. But he did, in fact, direct his followers to check out a sex tape.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the tweet -- sent at 5:30 a.m. ET on Sept. 30 -- Trump wrote, \"Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?\"\n(For the record, no one has turned up a sex tape.)\n\nOur ruling\nTrump said the tweet he sent out \"wasn\u2019t saying, \u2018check out a sex tape\u2019\" \u00a0but rather to \"just take a look at\" Machado\u2019s background.\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. While Trump did urge his Twitter followers to check out Machado\u2019s \"past,\" he literally wrote \"check out sex tape\" in the tweet.\nWe rate his statement Pants on Fire!\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c43aeea6-512d-4b14-a42a-80b0955e4504", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04168"}
