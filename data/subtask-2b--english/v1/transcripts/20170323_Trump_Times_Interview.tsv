0001	Donald Trump	Hey, Michael.
0002	Michael Scherer	Hey Mr. President, Thank you for taking the time.
0003	Donald Trump	Absolutely.
0004	Donald Trump	How have you been, OK?
0005	Michael Scherer	Yeah, it has been a wild couple months.
0006	Michael Scherer	You keep us busy.
0007	Donald Trump	Yeah, it's been good though.
0008	Donald Trump	It's been good. Do you want me to give you a quick overview
0009	SYSTEM	[of the story]
0010	Donald Trump	?
0011	Donald Trump	Yeah, it's a cool story.
0012	Donald Trump	I mean it's, the concept is right.
0013	Donald Trump	I predicted a lot of things, Michael.
0014	Donald Trump	Some things that came to you a little bit later.
0015	Donald Trump	But, you know, we just rolled out a list.
0016	Donald Trump	Sweden.
0017	Donald Trump	I make the statement, everyone goes crazy .
0018	Donald Trump	The next day they have a massive riot, and death, and problems. Huma
0019	SYSTEM	[Abedin]
0020	Donald Trump	and Anthony,
0021	SYSTEM	[Weiner]
0022	Donald Trump	you know, what I tweeted about that whole deal, and then it turned out he had it, all of Hillary's email on his thing.
0023	Donald Trump	NATO, obsolete , because it doesn't cover terrorism.
0024	Donald Trump	They fixed that, and I said that the allies must pay.
0025	Donald Trump	Nobody knew that they weren't paying.
0026	Donald Trump	I did.
0027	Donald Trump	I figured it.
0028	Donald Trump	Brexit, I was totally right about that .
0029	Donald Trump	You were over there I think, when I predicted that, right, the day before.
0030	Donald Trump	Brussels, I said, Brussels is not Brussels.
0031	Donald Trump	I mean many other things, the election's rigged against Bernie Sanders.
0032	Donald Trump	We have a lot of things.
0033	Michael Scherer	But there's other things you said that haven't panned out. The peg for this story is the wiretapping hearing on Monday, in which
0034	SYSTEM	[FBI Director James]
0035	Michael Scherer	Comey and
0036	SYSTEM	[NSA Director Mike]
0037	Michael Scherer	Rogers testified about your tweets there.
0038	Donald Trump	Yeah well if you'd look at, in fact I'll give you the front page story, and just today I heard, just a little while ago, that Devin Nunes had a news conference , did you hear about this, where they have a lot of information on tapping.
0039	Donald Trump	Did you hear about that?
0040	Michael Scherer	I have not, no.
0041	Donald Trump	Now remember this.
0042	Donald Trump	When I said wiretapping, it was in quotes.
0043	Donald Trump	Because a wiretapping is, you know today it is different than wire tapping.
0044	Donald Trump	It is just a good description.
0045	Donald Trump	But wiretapping was in quotes.
0046	Donald Trump	What I'm talking about is surveillance. And today,
0047	SYSTEM	[House Intelligence Committee Chairman]
0048	Donald Trump	Devin Nunes just had a news conference.
0049	Donald Trump	Now probably got obliterated by what's happened in London .
0050	Donald Trump	But just had a news conference, and here it is one of those things.
0051	Donald Trump	The other one, election, I said we are going to win, we won.
0052	Donald Trump	And many other things.
0053	Donald Trump	And I think this is going to be very interesting.
0054	Michael Scherer	So you don't feel like Comey's testimony in any way takes away from the credibility of the tweets you put out, even with the quotes?
0055	Donald Trump	No, I have, look.
0056	Donald Trump	I have articles saying it happened.
0057	Donald Trump	But you have to take a look at what they, they just went out at a news conference.
0058	Donald Trump	Devin Nunes had a news conference.
0059	Donald Trump	I mean I don't know, I was unable to see it, because I am at meetings, but they just had a news conference talking about surveillance.
0060	Donald Trump	Now again, it is in quotes.
0061	Donald Trump	That means surveillance and various other things.
0062	Donald Trump	And the New York Times had a frontpage story, which they actually reduced, they took it, they took it the word wiretapping out of the title, but its first story in the front page of the paper was wiretapping.
0063	Donald Trump	And a lot of information has just been learned, and a lot of information may be learned over the next coming period of time.
0064	Donald Trump	We will see what happens.
0065	Donald Trump	Look.
0066	Donald Trump	I predicted a lot of things that took a little of bit of Time.
0067	Donald Trump	Here, headline, for the front page of the New York Times , "Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides."
0068	Donald Trump	That's a headline.
0069	Donald Trump	Now they then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning.
0070	Donald Trump	They then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap.
0071	Donald Trump	Wiretapped data used in inquiry.
0072	Donald Trump	Then changed after that, they probably didn't like it.
0073	Donald Trump	And they changed the title.
0074	Donald Trump	They took the wiretap word out.
0075	Michael Scherer	One of my ideas here is that throughout the campaign and now as president, you have used disputed statements, this is one of them that is disputed, the claim that three million undocumented people voted in the election...
0076	Donald Trump	Well I think I will be proved right about that too.
0077	Michael Scherer	The claim that Muslims celebrated on 911 in New Jersey...
0078	Donald Trump	Well if you look at the reporter, he wrote the story in the Washington Post .
0079	Michael Scherer	But my idea is that whatever the reality of what you are describing, the fact that they are disputed makes them a more effective message, that you are able to spread the message further, that more people get excited about it, that it gets on TV.
0080	Donald Trump	Well now if you take a look at the votes, when I say that, I mean mostly they register wrong, in other words, for the votes, they register incorrectly, andor illegally.
0081	Donald Trump	And they then vote.
0082	Donald Trump	You have tremendous numbers of people.
0083	Donald Trump	In fact I'm forming a committee on it.
0084	Michael Scherer	But there's no evidence that 3 million people voted with...
0085	Donald Trump	We'll see after the committee.
0086	Donald Trump	I have people say it was more than that.
0087	Donald Trump	We will see after we have.
0088	Donald Trump	But there will be, we are forming a committee.
0089	Donald Trump	And we are going to do a study on it, a very serious problem.
0090	Michael Scherer	Is there anything different about making these kinds of predictions without having the factual evidence as President?
0091	Donald Trump	I'm a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right.
0092	Donald Trump	When everyone said I wasn't going to win the election, I said well I think I would.
0093	Donald Trump	You know it is interesting, somebody came up to me and said the other day, gee whiz, the New York Times and other people, you know other groups, had you down at one percent, well, I said no I think I am going to win, and people smiled, George Stephanopoulos laughed , you remember.
0094	Donald Trump	He thought it was very cute, and very funny.
0095	Donald Trump	Other people smiled.
0096	Donald Trump	And some people, the smart people or the people that know me didn't laugh at all.
0097	Donald Trump	There are people that know me, like Carl Icahn and many others, that didn't laugh at all, they thought I was going to win, because they understand how I, they understand me.
0098	Donald Trump	They get it.
0099	Donald Trump	But you take a look and guess what, I won, and I won easily.
0100	Donald Trump	I predicted Brexit.
0101	Donald Trump	Remember they said there was no way to get to 270?
0102	Donald Trump	Well I ended up at 306.
0103	Donald Trump	I had election night, 306.
0104	Donald Trump	But there was no way to get to, in fact I went to Maine four times, four times I went to Maine, because I had to get one vote, because there was no way to get to 270, but I ended up getting to 306.
0105	Donald Trump	Brexit, I predicted Brexit, you remember that, the day before the event.
0106	Donald Trump	I said, no, Brexit is going to happen, and everybody laughed, and Brexit happened.
0107	Donald Trump	Many many things.
0108	Donald Trump	They turn out to be right.
0109	Donald Trump	And now today, Devin Nunes, just had a news conference.
0110	Michael Scherer	I'll look that up.
0111	Donald Trump	Yeah, just had it.
0112	Donald Trump	Now the problem, the thing is, I'm not sure they are watching anything other than that, let's see members of Donald Trump transition team, possibly, oh this just came out.
0113	Donald Trump	This is a Politico story .
0114	Donald Trump	Members of the Donald Trump Transition team possibly including Trump himself were under surveillance during the Obama administration following November's election.
0115	Donald Trump	House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes told reporters, wow.
0116	Donald Trump	Nunes said, so that means I'm right, Nunes said the surveillance appears to have been ... incidental collection, that does not appear to have been related to concerns over Russia.
0117	Michael Scherer	But so incidental collection would not be wiretapping of you, it would be wiretapping of...
0118	Donald Trump	Who knows what it is?
0119	Donald Trump	You know, why, because somebody says incidental.
0120	Donald Trump	Nunes is going to the White House.
0121	Michael Scherer	Nunes has also said that he has no evidence that your tweet was right, previously.
0122	Donald Trump	Well, he just got this information.
0123	Donald Trump	This was new information.
0124	Donald Trump	That was just got.
0125	Donald Trump	Members, of, let's see, were under surveillance during the Obama Administration following November's election.
0126	Donald Trump	Wow.
0127	Donald Trump	This just came out.
0128	Donald Trump	So, ah, just came out.
0129	Michael Scherer	Mitch McConnell has said he'd rather you stop tweeting , that he sees it as a distraction.
0130	Donald Trump	Mitch will speak for himself.
0131	Donald Trump	Mitch is a wonderful man.
0132	Donald Trump	Mitch should speak for himself.
0133	Michael Scherer	But you don't see any problems caused by these kinds of controversies.
0134	Michael Scherer	Does this, when we are talking in the press about whether the president was wiretapped or not, is this good for you or bad for you?
0135	Donald Trump	Probably neither.
0136	Donald Trump	Probably neither.
0137	Donald Trump	What I said, look I said, Donna Brazile had information , and she had information on Hillary's debate questions.
0138	Donald Trump	I said why didn't Hillary apologize.
0139	Donald Trump	Donna Brazile just admitted that that was right.
0140	Donald Trump	I said the election was rigged against Bernie, a lot of people agree with that one, a lot of people hated the statement when I made it.
0141	Michael Scherer	But I grant you some of those.
0142	Michael Scherer	But you would agree also that some of the things you have said haven't been true.
0143	Michael Scherer	You say that Ted Cruz's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald .
0144	Donald Trump	Well that was in a newspaper.
0145	Donald Trump	No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he's a friend of mine.
0146	Donald Trump	But that was in the newspaper.
0147	Donald Trump	I wasn't, I didn't say that.
0148	Donald Trump	I was referring to a newspaper.
0149	Donald Trump	A Ted Cruz article referred to a newspaper story with, had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast.
0150	Michael Scherer	That gets close to the heart...
0151	Donald Trump	Why do you say that I have to apologize?
0152	Donald Trump	I'm just quoting the newspaper, just like I quoted the judge the other day, Judge Napolitano, I quoted Judge Napolitano , just like I quoted Bret Baier, I mean Bret Baier mentioned the word wiretap.
0153	Donald Trump	Now he can now deny it, or whatever he is doing, you know.
0154	Donald Trump	But I watched Bret Baier, and he used that term.
0155	Donald Trump	I have a lot of respect for Judge Napolitano, and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right.
0156	Donald Trump	I don't know where he has gone with it since then.
0157	Donald Trump	But I'm quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks.
0158	Michael Scherer	But traditionally people in your position in the Oval Office have not said things unless they can verify they are true.
0159	Donald Trump	Well, I'm not, well, I think, I'm not saying, I'm quoting, Michael, I'm quoting highly respected people and sources from major television networks.
0160	Michael Scherer	Did you see the Wall Street Journal opinion page today , the editorial page?
0161	Donald Trump	I thought it was, I thought it was a disgrace that they could write that.
0162	Michael Scherer	But let me just, the hypothetical they started with, you have to announce to the country or to the world that some serious national security event has happened, and...
0163	Donald Trump	The country believes me.
0164	Donald Trump	Hey.
0165	Donald Trump	I went to Kentucky two nights ago , we had 25,000 people in a massive basketball arena.
0166	Donald Trump	There wasn't a seat, they had to send away people.
0167	Donald Trump	I went to Tennessee four nights ago.
0168	Donald Trump	We had a packed house, they had to send away thousands of people.
0169	Donald Trump	You saw that, right.
0170	Donald Trump	Did you see that?
0171	Michael Scherer	Yes I did.
0172	Donald Trump	The country's not buying it, it is fake media.
0173	Donald Trump	And the Wall Street Journal is a part of it.
0174	Michael Scherer	Ok.
0175	Michael Scherer	So you don't worry that your credibility, that if you've cited things that later turn out to be wrong, based on anonymous sources that that hurts you.
0176	Donald Trump	Name what's wrong!
0177	Donald Trump	I mean, honestly.
0178	Michael Scherer	Fox News said...
0179	Donald Trump	Brexit.
0180	Donald Trump	Wait a minute.
0181	Donald Trump	I predicted Brexit.
0182	Donald Trump	What I said about NATO was true, people aren't paying their bills.
0183	Donald Trump	And everyone said it was a horrible thing to say.
0184	Donald Trump	And then they found out.
0185	Donald Trump	And when Germany was over here I said, we are going to have a great relationship with Germany but you have to pay your NATO bills, and they don't even dispute it, ok.
0186	Donald Trump	So what have I said that is wrong?
0187	Donald Trump	Everyone, I got attacked on NATO and now they are all saying I was right.
0188	Donald Trump	I got attacked on Brexit, when I was saying, I said long before the day before, I said the day before the opening, but I was saying Brexit was going to pass, and everybody was laughing, and I turned out to be right on that.
0189	Donald Trump	I took a lot of heat when I said Brexit was going to pass.
0190	Donald Trump	Don't forget, Obama said that U.K. will go to the back of the line, and I talked about Sweden, and may have been somewhat different, but the following day, two days later, they had a massive riot in Sweden, exactly what I was talking about, I was right about that.
0191	Michael Scherer	But even in that Sweden quote, you said look at what happened on Friday in Sweden.
0192	Michael Scherer	But you are now saying you were referring to something that happened the following day.
0193	Donald Trump	No I am saying I was right.
0194	Donald Trump	I am talking about Sweden.
0195	Donald Trump	I'm talking about what Sweden has done to themselves is very sad, that is what I am talking about.
0196	Donald Trump	That is what I am talking about.
0197	Donald Trump	You can phrase it any way you want.
0198	Donald Trump	A day later they had a horrible, horrible riot in Sweden and you saw what happened.
0199	Donald Trump	I talked about Brussels.
0200	Donald Trump	I was on the front page of the New York Times for my quote.
0201	Donald Trump	I said Brussels is not what it used to be, very sad what has happened to Brussels.
0202	Donald Trump	I was absolutely lambasted.
0203	Donald Trump	A short Time later they had the major attack in Brussels.
0204	Donald Trump	One year ago today.
0205	Donald Trump	Exactly one year ago today.
0206	Donald Trump	And then people said you know Trump was right.
0207	Donald Trump	What am I going to tell you?
0208	Donald Trump	I tend to be right.
0209	Donald Trump	I'm an instinctual person, I happen to be a person that knows how life works.
0210	Donald Trump	I said I was going to win the election, I won the election, in fact I was number one the entire route, in the primaries, from the day I announced, I was number one.
0211	Donald Trump	And the New York Times and CNN and all of them, they did these polls, which were extremely bad and they turned out to be totally wrong, and my polls showed I was going to win.
0212	Donald Trump	We thought we were going to win the night of the election.
0213	Michael Scherer	So when you...
0214	Donald Trump	And then Time magazine, which treats me horribly, but obviously I sell, I assume this is going to be a cover too, have I set the record?
0215	Donald Trump	I guess, right?
0216	Donald Trump	Covers, nobody's had more covers.
0217	Michael Scherer	I think Richard Nixon still has you beat .
0218	Michael Scherer	But he was in office for longer, so give yourself time.
0219	Donald Trump	Ok good.
0220	Donald Trump	I'm sure I'll win.
0221	Michael Scherer	If you go back to Comey testifying that he and the Justice Department have no information to back up your tweet, the head of the NSA testifying that there is no information to back up your tweet, or the claim made by Judge Napolitano...
0222	Donald Trump	On front page of the New York Times , OK?
0223	Donald Trump	It's in the title of the front page. And I would like you to officially I know you are going to write a bad article because you always do
0224	SYSTEM	[mention]
0225	Donald Trump	wiretap data used in inquiry of Trump aides.
0226	Donald Trump	OK. Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aids.
0227	Donald Trump	Ok?
0228	Donald Trump	Can you possibly put that down?
0229	Donald Trump	Front page, January 20th.
0230	Donald Trump	Now in their second editions, they took it all down under the internet.
0231	Donald Trump	They took that out.
0232	Donald Trump	Ok?
0233	Donald Trump	But that's the way it is.
0234	Donald Trump	And then they just had a news conference now where they turned out, you watch.
0235	Donald Trump	You watch.
0236	Michael Scherer	That is different...
0237	Donald Trump	I'm not criticizing anybody, I'm just saying.
0238	Michael Scherer	That is different that the president wiretapping you which would be a crime outside of a court.
0239	Donald Trump	Well I don't know where these wiretaps came from.
0240	Donald Trump	They came from someplace.
0241	Donald Trump	That is what they should find out.
0242	Donald Trump	And you know the real story here is about the leakers.
0243	Donald Trump	OK?
0244	Donald Trump	You don't write about that.
0245	Donald Trump	But the real story here is, who released General Flynn's name?
0246	Donald Trump	Who released, who released my conversations with Australia, and who released my conversation with Mexico?
0247	Donald Trump	To me, Michael, that's the story, these leakers, they are disgusting.
0248	Donald Trump	These are horrible people.
0249	Michael Scherer	And apparently there is an investigation into that as well.
0250	Donald Trump	Well should be, because that's where the whole, who would think that you are speaking to the head of Mexico, the head of Australia, or General Flynn, who was, they are not supposed to release that.
0251	Donald Trump	That is the most confidential stuff.
0252	Donald Trump	Classified.
0253	Donald Trump	That's classified.
0254	Donald Trump	You go to prison when you release stuff like that.
0255	Donald Trump	And who would release that?
0256	Donald Trump	The real story is, they have to work, intelligence has to work on finding out who are the leakers.
0257	Donald Trump	Because you know what?
0258	Donald Trump	When things get involved with North Korea and all the problems we have there, in the Middle East, I mean, that information cannot be leaked out, and it will be by this, this same, and these people were here in the Obama years, because he had plenty of leakers also.
0259	Donald Trump	But intelligence has to find out, who are these people.
0260	Donald Trump	Because the biggest story here is, who is leaking this classified information.
0261	Michael Scherer	But isn't there, it strikes me there is still an issue of credibility.
0262	Michael Scherer	If the intelligence community came out and said, we have determined that so and so is the leaker here, but you are saying to me now, that you don't believe the intelligence community when they say your tweet was wrong.
0263	Donald Trump	I'm not saying no, I'm not blaming.
0264	Donald Trump	First of all, I put Mike Pompeo in.
0265	Donald Trump	I put Senator Dan Coats in.
0266	Donald Trump	These are great people.
0267	Donald Trump	I think they are great people and they are going to, I have a lot of confidence in them.
0268	Donald Trump	So hopefully things will straighten out.
0269	Donald Trump	But I inherited a mess, I inherited a mess in so many ways.
0270	Donald Trump	I inherited a mess in the Middle East, and a mess with North Korea, I inherited a mess with jobs, despite the statistics, you know, my statistics are even better, but they are not the real statistics because you have millions of people that can't get a job, ok. And I inherited a mess on trade.
0271	Donald Trump	I mean we have many, you can go up and down the ladder.
0272	Donald Trump	But that's the story.
0273	Donald Trump	Hey look, in the mean Time, I guess, I can't be doing so badly, because I'm president, and you're not.
0274	Donald Trump	You know.
0275	Donald Trump	Say hello to everybody OK?
0276	Michael Scherer	Thank you very much, Mr. President.
