The May 16 post said that once elected, Riddle vows to start impeachment proceedings against President Barack Obama and that the reasoning behind such action begins with the Alaskan island giveaway, as quoted by Mother Jones.\n\nSix weeks earlier, in a March 27, 2012 item, FactCheck had addressed an \"e-rumor\" containing a similar statement.\n\n\"It is simply false to claim that Obama is \u2018giving away\u2019 islands to which no U.S. president has asserted a claim for more than 85 years, if ever,\" wrote FactCheck, which is a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe text version of the rumor that FactCheck examined gives several specifics that also appear in Riddle\u2019s post. Among them: The seven islands and their many miles of \"rich oil seabeds\" were \"given away,\" the text says, in secret negotiations from which Alaska was excluded. But Obama or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could stop the process with a pen stroke, it says.\n\nFactCheck\u2019s findings: Although after a U.S. Navy survey in 1881, the U.S. Geological Survey listed five of the islands as being in the \"District of Alaska,\" the United States has never claimed them or disputed the Soviet or Russian claim to them.\n\n\"All lie on the Russian side of the U.S.-Russia maritime boundary set by a treaty that the U.S. Senate ratified overwhelmingly more than two decades ago, after being signed by President George H.W. Bush, and with the support of both of Alaska\u2019s senators,\" FactCheck wrote, going on to explain that the treaty was made with the Soviet Union before its 1991 collapse and never ratified by Russia, but that Russia informed the U.S. it intended to abide by the terms.\n\nThough this is an old issue, FactCheck said, it resurfaced in a Feb. 26, 2012, opinion piece by Joe Miller, a former Alaskan candidate for U.S. Senate. Miller\u2019s piece on the conservative site World Net Daily is similar in wording and content to the \"viral\" text FactCheck examined and to Riddle\u2019s item.\n\nLike Riddle\u2019s claim that the U.S. \"is giving away\" the islands, many versions of the rumor that we found online state or imply that Obama\u2019s administration has an active role. White House spokesman Brandon Lepow told us by email that current U.S. policy in the Arctic is described in a 2009 State Department fact sheet, which says the U.S. and Russia are not discussing boundary changes. Lepow said there has been no change to the policy.\n\nThe 1990 treaty sets the modern maritime boundary at the line drawn when the U.S. bought Alaska from Russia -- or more specifically, the \"Emperor of all the Russias\" -- in 1867. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBy telephone, Riddle told us that he stands by his statement, but said, \"I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we didn\u2019t get some bad information that we ran with. That\u2019s possible. It\u2019s a cautionary note for anybody.\"\n\nRiddle said he did not know of the FactCheck.org item until we called him.\n\n\"It\u2019s hard these days to judge the veracity of information,\" he said. \"Obviously, it\u2019s important to do so, and before anyone develops specific policy, not only to develop positions but to check everything.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that, as FactCheck noted, Russia has not ratified the 1990 treaty, and says he would favor renegotiating it.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThough Riddle took the item off his Facebook page, he stands by it, so we\u2019ll ratify our colleagues\u2019 findings and rate his statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10685"}
