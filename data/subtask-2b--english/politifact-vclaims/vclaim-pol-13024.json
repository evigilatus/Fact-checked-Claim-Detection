When Memorial Day weekend began, they were in the neighborhood of $3.88 a gallon, though prices varied some throughout the state.\n\nBut that\u2019s still a big jump since the beginning of 2011, when drivers were paying around $3 a gallon for regular unleaded.\n\nWith the pain at the pump setting in, the corn growers and ethanol industry are trying to make the best of a bad situation. In a radio ad, the Wisconsin Corn Growers Association tells drivers that prices would be even higher without ethanol in the mix.\n\nOne version of the ad uses a fake host, \"Filler Up Phil\" who takes calls from people concerned about high gas prices. He tells one caller that ethanol adds to the nation\u2019s fuel supply, and tells another that the fuel additive helps save consumers money.\n\n\"Without ethanol, gas prices would be at least 15 percent higher,\" the fake host says. \"With gas at four bucks, that means you\u2019re saving 12 bucks on a 20 gallon fill-up.\"\n\nThat\u2019ll get your attention, no matter what kind of car you drive. It\u2019s a specific claim but -- as with political ads -- carries a broader message: Ethanol is a boon for your wallet.\n\nSo, let\u2019s husk it.\n\nFirst, a little background.\n\nMost gasoline is blended with 10 percent ethanol, a fuel made from corn. That\u2019s part of federal legislation pushed by the corn growers, the ethanol industry and renewable fuels supporters that seeks to boost the amount of ethanol we burn in our cars. The industry is encouraged -- and propped up -- by a controversial $6 billion package of tax credits, production mandates and tariffs.\n\nA key argument in favor of ethanol is that each gallon burned means less oil that needs to be imported.\n\nThe federal law seeks to boost ethanol production over time. The goal is to reach 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the U.S. market by 2022. Production was about 13 billion gallons in 2010, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe effort is driven by a variety of tax breaks and incentives, including a 45 cents a gallon tax credit paid to refineries and a 54 cent a gallon tariff on imported ethanol. The feds also require ethanol to be blended with conventional gas, and since last year when demand fell, they\u2019ve come up with new ways to boost ethanol consumption.\n\nBut ethanol subsidies are under attack on a variety of fronts, including those who see the system \u00a0as a wasteful industry handout. The Wall Street Journal editorial board in January launched a major attack on the fuel -- and ethanol backer GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.\n\nThe newspaper said four of every 10 rows of corn in the U.S. are grown for ethanol, an argument that fed complaints that a food crop was being wasted in our gas tanks. Still others condemn ethanol\u2019s poor fuel efficiency and pollution impacts. And others blame ethanol for driving up the cost of food.\n\nSo, what about the claim in the ad?\n\nThe group based its claim on a 2008 report from the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University. The researchers found that ethanol reduces the cost of gasoline by about 40 cents a gallon.\n\nThey issued an updated report in April 2011 that factored in 2010 data for oil prices and increased production of ethanol. That report delivered an even more startling conclusion: Ethanol cuts gas prices by 89 cents a gallon.\n\nIt\u2019s even higher if you live in the Midwest -- $1.37 a gallon, the new report says.\n\nAnd the latest report from the center goes one step further. The researchers looked at what would happen if ethanol production stopped immediately. A gallon of gas would cost up to $7.20, or $144 for that 20 gallon fill up.\n\nSo when you do the math, the savings is even higher than described in the ad.\n\nBut there is another side to the issue -- one that carries its own costs.\n\nThe ethanol industry is supported by those aforementioned tax incentives. And federal law requires the industry to brew more, and burn more.\n\nIncluding all of those factors, the Natural Resources Defense Council says it costs taxpayers $4.18 to produce each gallon of ethanol. Oil companies will be forced to buy more of the fuel that taxpayers have paid to brew, the group argues.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question about burning food for fuel, and the impact that ethanol has on food prices. More corn burned means your cornflakes cost more.\n\nIowa State University economist Bruce Babcock last year estimated that ethanol policies drive up the cost of food by at least 1.5 percent.\n\n\"I don't see why we can really justify subsidies, when all that does is raises cost of producing food,\" Babcock told National Public Radio.\n\nSo where does that leave us (other than relieved we\u2019re not paying $7 a gallon for gas)?\n\nThe corn growers say we\u2019re paying less at the pump, thanks to ethanol being blended into gasoline. \u00a0The study they cite provides support for the claim -- indeed, an updated version \u00a0suggests the radio ad actually low balls the savings per fill-up.\n\nBut there is a cost to taxpayers to support the ethanol program -- $6 billion a year -- which goes unmentioned in the ad. And using food for fuel drives up the cost of your grocery bill, even as the price at the pump is offset by the program. And there are pollution and fuel efficiency concerns tied to the additive. Those are also unmentioned.\n\nSo, while generally true, the claim leaves out important information. On our gauge that\u2019s a Half \u00a0True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13024"}
