Linda S\u00e1nchez of California joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats to show support for child care legislation to help businesses and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"The average cost of child care in this country is more than what it costs to send a child to college for one year,\" S\u00e1nchez said at the press conference. Later that day, the House passed two bills to provide funding to child care providers.\nS\u00e1nchez did not specify what timespan she was referring to for child care spending, and her spokesperson did not respond for comment.\u00a0\nWe found that child care certainly isn\u2019t cheap, and depending on how you count it, it can cost nearly as much as a year of college. But, in most cases, in a year-to-year comparison, a year of college costs more.\nChild care industry jolted by pandemic\nLike many things during the pandemic, the already complicated landscape of child care has become even more difficult for families amid shutdowns.\u00a0\nAt some point during the pandemic, half of child care programs closed, and, according to a July National Association for the Education of Young Children survey, about 40% of child care providers say they will close permanently if they don\u2019t receive additional assistance from the government.\nHalf of infants and toddlers and 63% of 3- to 5-year-olds were in nonparental child care in 2012, according to a 2016 survey by the Health and Human Services Department and the University of Chicago.\nThe Cares Act, a congressional COVID-19 relief package passed in March, provided the child care industry with $3.5 billion. The Child Care Is Essential Act, which S\u00e1nchez co-sponsored, would allocate $50 billion in grants to child care providers.\u00a0\nComparing price of child care to college\nA 2019 report by Child Care Aware of America, an advocacy group that provides families with child care resources, found the average price of center-based infant, toddler and 4-year-old care in each state and D.C.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitiFact\u2019s analysis of the group\u2019s numbers found that the nationwide median price of infant care is $11,107 annually. That figure falls to $10,267 for toddlers and $8,834 for 4-year-olds.\nBy comparison, in 2017-18, the average price of tuition, fees, room and board for all four-year colleges \u2014 including public and private institutions \u2014\u00a0was $27,357, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Clearly, that\u2019s more than what families nationwide average for one year of child care for an infant, toddler or a 4-year-old.\nIf you look only at four-year public colleges, the total cost drops to $20,050 for a year on average, according to Education Department figures. That\u2019s still more than the median price of one year of center-based infant, toddler or 4-year-old child care.\u00a0\nWe should note that these college and child care figures don\u2019t take financial assistance into account. In addition, many families depend on child care outside of centers, including through a family member or trusted friend.\nTo be sure, there are instances when a year of child care can cost more than a year of college tuition, particularly in-state tuition for public universities. But S\u00e1nchez wasn\u2019t that precise in her claim.\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\"The average cost of child care in this country is more than what it costs to send a child to college for one year,\" S\u00e1nchez said.\nThe nationwide median annual price of infant, toddler and 4-year-old care is much less expensive than the nationwide average of a year at a four-year college. However, a year of center-based child care is more expensive than a year of in-state public college tuition in many states.\nS\u00e1nchez did not specify a timeframe for her comparison. If she meant to compare the annual price of a four-year college to the amount families pay for a year of infant, toddler or 4-year-old center-based care, then her statement is incorrect. However, comparing the price of college to the price of child care over the course of a child\u2019s lifetime would show a different picture.\nWe rate S\u00e1nchez\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17065"}
